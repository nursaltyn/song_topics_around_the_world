Have I ever told you
I want you to the bone
Have I ever called you
When you are all alone
And if I ever forget
To tell you how I feel
Listen to me now, babe
I want you to the bone

I want you to the bone, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I want you to the bone, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Maybe if you can see
What I feel through my bone
Every corner in me
There's your presence that grown
Maybe I nurture it more
By saying how I feel
But I did mean it before
I want you to the bone
I want you to

Take me home, I’m fallin'
Love me long, I'm rollin’
Losing control, body and soul
Mind too for sure, I'm already yours
Walk you down, I'm all in
Hold you tight, you call and
I'll take control your body and soul
Mind too for sure, I'm already yours

Would that be alright?
Hey, would that be alright?
I want you to the bone
So bad I can't breathe
I want you to the bone

Of all the ones that begged to stay
I'm still longing for you
Of all the ones that cried their way
I'm still waiting on you
Maybe we seek for something that
We couldn’t ever have
Maybe we choose the only love
We know we won’t accept
Or maybe we're taking all the risks
For something that is real
’Cause maybe the greatest love of all
Is who the eyes can't see, yeah


Take me home, I'm fallin'
Love me long, I’m rollin'
Losing control, body and soul
Mind too for sure, I'm already yours
Walk you down, I'm all in
Hold you tight, I call and

1,1,1,Feby Putri,Runtuh,"2 ContributorsRuntuh Lyrics

Ku terbangun lagi di antara sepi
Hanya pikiran yang ramai
Mengutuki diri tak bisa kembali
Tuk mengubah alur kisah

Ketika mereka meminta tawa
Ternyata rela tak semudah kata

Tak perlu khawatir, ku hanya terluka
Terbiasa tuk pura-pura tertawa
Namun, bolehkah sekali saja ku menangis?
Sebelum kembali membohongi diri

Ketika kau lelah, berhentilah dulu
Beri ruang, beri waktu

Mereka bilang, syukurilah saja
Padahal rela tak semudah kata

Kita hanyalah manusia yang terluka
Terbiasa tuk pura-pura tertawa
Namun, bolehkah sekali saja ku menangis?

Ku ingin belajar menerima diriEmbed","2 Contributors Collapse Lyrics

I woke up again amidst the silence
Just busy thoughts
Cursing yourself can not come back
To change the storyline

When they ask for laughter
It turns out that willing is not as easy as words

Don't worry, I'm just hurt
Used to pretend to laugh
However, can I just cry once?
Before lying again

When you are tired, stop first
Give space, give time

They said, just be grateful
Even though willing is not as easy as words

Loceng bunyi
Terus teruja sambil kulari
Namun hampa bila kudapati
Surat lagi, dengan rantai emas darimu

Tak perlu dijual beli dengan duitmu

Bell sounds
Stay excited while cooking
But it's empty when I find it
Another letter, with a gold chain from you
Prada, Gucci
Right in front of my eyes but I don't care
With anything you give days
Knock girls you can buy

Oh, me
(I don't want, I don't want)
Gem gold
(I don't want, I don't want)
Anything from you, my love
No need to buy and sell with your money
But (How, I want)
You by my side (How, I want)
You always treat me
Listen to my heart
With a sincere heart
I am not for sale

This house is just filled with noise
Echoes of the Jimmy Choo shoes you bought for your birthday
The one you didn't send yourself
You always tell me to bring your Maserati
Shop with your Mastercard

Bun, hidup berjalan seperti bajingan
Seperti landak yang tak punya teman

Menjadi gagah saat 'ku tak bisa

As if the most proficient
Calm yourself

Never fair

Grieve together

Dari kejauhan tergambar cerita tentang kita
Terpisah jarak dan waktu
Ingin kuungkapkan rinduku lewat kata indah
Tak cukup untuk dirimu

Sebab kau terlalu indah dari sekedar kata
Dunia berhenti sejenak menikmati indahmu

Dan apabila tak bersamamu
Kupastikan kujalani dunia tak seindah kemarin
Sederhana tertawamu sudah cukup!
Lengkapi sempurnanya hidup bersamamu
Jika hari kulalui tanpa hawamu
Percuma senyumku dengan dia, ooh

Sampai saat ini tak terpikir olehku
Aku pernah beri rasa pada orang sepertimu
Seandainya sejak awal tak kuyakinkan diriku
Tutur kata yang sempurna, tak sebaik yang kukira

Andai 'ku tahu semua akan sia-sia
Takkan kut'rima cinta sesaatmu

Bagaimana dengan aku terlanjur mencintaimu?
Yang datang beri harapan, lalu pergi dan menghilang
Tak terpikirkan olehmu, hatiku hancur kar'namu
Tanpa sedikit alasan, pergi tanpa berpamitan
Takkan kut'rima cinta sesaatmu

So far, I haven't thought about it
I've never had feelings for someone like you
If only I hadn't convinced myself from the start
Perfect speech, not as good as I thought

If I knew all would be in vain
I will not accept your momentary love

What if I already love you?
Those who come give hope, then leave and disappear
Unthinkable of you, my heart breaks because of you
Without the slightest reason, left without saying goodbye
I will not accept your momentary love

Youngblood thinks there's always tomorrow
I miss your touch some nights when I'm hollow
I know you crossed a bridge that I can't follow
Since the love that you left is all that I get, I want you to know

That if I can't be close to you, I'll settle for the ghost of you
I miss you more than life (More than life)
And if you can't be next to me, your memory is ecstasy
I miss you more than life, I miss you more than life

Waktu demi waktu
Hari demi hari
Sadar ku t’lah sendiri
Kau t’lah pergi jauh
Tinggalkan diriku
Ternyata ku rindu

Senyuman yang s’lalu membungkus hati yang terluka
Di depan mereka
Tuhan masih pantaskah ku ‘tuk bersamanya
Karna hati ini inginkannya

Tak segampang itu ku mencari penggantimu
Tak segampang itu ku menemukan sosok seperti dirimu cinta
Kau tahu betapa besar cinta yang kutanamkan padamu
Mengapa kau memilih untuk berpisah

Terlalu besar kutaruh harapan pada dirimu
Itu alasanku lama tanpa dirimu
Mereka yang bilang ku akan dapat lebih darimu
Tak mungkin
Semua itu tak mudah

This is a story I hate

How you said there was nobody else
Then you got up and went to her house
You guys always left me out

I still have the letter you wrote when you told me
That I was the only girl you'd ever want in your life
I guess my friends were right

Each day goes by and each night, I cry
Somebody saw you with her last night
You gave me your word, ""Don't worry 'bout her""
You might love her now, but you loved me first
Said you'd never hurt me, but here we are

How could you be so reckless with my heart?

Sudah kucoba sepenuh hati
Untuk menjadi malaikat
Menepikan perasaan
Runtuhkan egoku
Namun sayapku remuk

Bila kutanya pada diriku
Mengapa aku bertahan
Menerima keadaan yang tak baik saja
Memaksakan segalanya

Sakit
Tak sanggup
Sadarkah kita terlalu hancur
Hilang
Habis tak bersisa
Tapi tak mampu kumenyerah
Tertawan hati

Tak mau kehilangan
Tapi lelah berjuang
Bukankah rumah tempatku bersandar?
Sendiri ku tak bisa
Bersama kutersiksa
Ini kenyataannya kita tak baik saja

I have tried wholeheartedly
To become an angel
Get rid of feelings
Tear down my ego
But my wings were crushed

When I ask myself
Why did I survive
Accept the bad condition
Forcing everything

Sick
Can not bear
Do you realize we are too broken
Is lost
It's gone
But I can't give up
Caught heart

Don't want to lose
But tired of fighting
Is not the house where I lean?
I can't do it myself
Together I tormented
This is the reality we are not okay

Tak mungkin secepat itu kau lupa

Sungguh-sungguh ingin aku lindungi
Dan setelah luka-lukamu reda
Kau lupa aku juga punya rasa

Lalu kau pergi kembali dengannya
Aku pernah menyentuhmu apa kau malu

Kadang dering masih ada namamu
Beberapa pesan singkat untukku
Entah apa maksudmu, yang kutahu

The allure that you do have
I really want to protect
And after your wounds subside
Don't forget that I have feelings too

Then you go back with him
I never touched you are you ashamed

Sometimes the ring still has your name
Some short messages for me

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

Brown guilty eyes and
Little white lies, yeah
I played dumb, but I always knew
That you talked to her, maybe did even worse
I kept quiet so I could keep you

And ain't it funny how you ran to her
The second that we called it quits?
And ain't it funny how you said you were friends?
Now it sure as hell don't look like it

You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah
You talked to her when we were together
Loved you at your worst, but that didn't matter
It took you two weeks to go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still a traitor

Now you bring her around just to shut me down
Show her off like she's a new trophy
And I know if you were true, there's no damn way that you
Could fall in love with somebody that quickly

And ain't it funny? All the twisted games
All the questions you used to avoid
Ain't it funny? Remember I brought her up
And you told me I was paranoid?

You betrayed me

Goin' out tonight, changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Everything she never had, she's showing off
Driving too fast, moon is breaking through her hair
She's heading for something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

(Ooh) We're only getting older, baby
(Ooh) And I've been thinking about it lately
(Ooh) Does it ever drive you crazy
(Ah-ah-ah) Just how fast the night changes?
(Ooh) Everything that you've ever dreamed of
(Ooh) Disappearing when you wake up
(Ooh) But there's nothing to be afraid of
(Ah-ah-ah) Even when the night changes
(Ooh) It will never change me and you

Chasing her tonight, doubts are running 'round her head
He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beating loud and she doesn't want it to stop
Moving too fast, moon is lightin' up her skin

I'm still a fan even though I was salty
Hate to see you with some other broad, know you happy
Hate to see you happy if I'm not the one drivin'

I'm so mature, I'm so mature
I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
I don't want none, I just want you
If I can't have you, no one should, I might

I might kill my ex, not the best idea
His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?
I might kill my ex, I still love him, though
Rather be in jail than alone

I get the sense that it's a lost cause
I get the sense that you might really love her
The text gon' be evidence, this text is evidence
I try to ration with you, no murders, no crime of passion
But, damn, you was out of reach
You was at the farmer's market with your perfect peach

And I'll take the kids to school, wave them goodbye

For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, woah
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that every day, you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you and I hope you know
Darlin', your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far, my dear, look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me when I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till my lungs give out
I promise till death we part, like in our vows
So, I wrote this song for you, now everybody knows
That it's just you and me till we're grey and old

Bilur makin terhampar dalam rangkuman asa
Kalimat hilang makna, logika tak berdaya
Di tepian nestapa, hasrat terbungkam sunyi
Entah aku pengecut, entah kau tidak peka

Kumendambakanmu mendambakanku

Bila kau butuh telinga 'tuk mendengar
Bahu 'tuk bersandar, raga 'tuk berlindung
Pasti kau temukan aku di garis terdepan
Bertepuk dengan sebelah tangan

Kau membuatku yakin, malaikat tak selalu bersayap
Biar saja menanti tanpa batas, tanpa balas
Tetap menjelma cahaya di angkasa
Yang sulit tertampik dan sukar tergapai

Kumendambakanmu mendambakanku

Bila kau butuh telinga 'tuk mendengar
Bahu 'tuk bersandar, raga 'tuk berlindung

Welts are increasingly spread out in despair
Sentences lost meaning, logic powerless
On the edge of sorrow, desire is silenced
Either I'm a coward, or you're insensitive

I crave you crave me

When you need ears to hear
Shoulders to lean on, body to take shelter
You must have found me on the front lines
Clap with one hand

You made me sure, angels don't always have wings
Just let it wait indefinitely, without reply
Keep turning the light in the sky
Which is hard to touch and hard to reach

Tapi mengapa tiba-tiba seakan kau pergi
Melepas rangkulanmu dan berhenti melindungiku tanpa sebab

Mungkin alam semesta tak menerimanya
Dan waktu tak memberi kesempatannya
Tapi setidaknya kau telah merubahku
Dari resah menjadi luka

Ku menemukanmu saat aku terjatuh

Kau melindungiku di saat yang lain menyerangku
Ingin rasanya aku melihatmu di setiap langkahku

Dari resah menjadi luka

Menunggu alam semesta menerima

I found you when I was trapped
In a situation that makes me uneasy
You embrace me when others oppress me
I want to always be with you

But why suddenly it's like you're gone
Let go of your embrace and stop protecting me for no reason

Maybe the universe doesn't accept it
And time doesn't give it a chance
But at least you have changed me
From restlessness to pain

I found you when I fell
Into a room full of bitterness
You protect me when others attack me
I want to see you in every step I take

But why suddenly it's like you're gone
Let go of your embrace and stop protecting me for no reason
You might also like
Maybe the universe doesn't accept it
And time doesn't give it a chance
But at least you have changed me
From restlessness to pain

But I will stay here
Waiting for the universe to accept
And the wind brought the answer
Because my heartbeat and pulse will always be

When we’re out in a crowd laughing loud and nobody knows why
When we’re lost at a club getting drunk and you give me that smile
Going home in the back of a car and your hand touches mine

'Cause all of the small things that you do
Are what remind me why I fell for you
And when we’re apart and I’m missing you
I close my eyes and all I see is you

Living all alone kinda forgot it's been that long
Since someone’s gone, I've been trying to be a little bit strong
And it is not that easy to be exactly who I was
My shit is done, now it's time for me try to moving on

’Cuz if you think I'm such a happy person, no you are wrong
By saying my laughter is louder than yours
Shut your freakin' mouth
No one knows what I feel and what i suffer, no they don't know
So keep your thoughts and stop assuming that
Someone is always fine


I keep thinking why my friends left me, I can go insane
Mom was right about that and now I can't trust again
But I think I don't really need no friends
I'm alone and it's not that bad
Then again it hurts me so bad and people just don’t know that
Maybe this time, I’ma take back what is mine

All the smiles all the joys those are mine
There will be no more cry, and
There will be no more try, and
These places I never belong

Maukah lagi kau mengulang ragu
Dan sendu yang lama
Dia yang dulu pernah bersamamu
Memahat kecewa

Atau kau inginkan yang baru
Sungguh menyayangimu

Aku ingin dirimu

Bersamaku mulai hari ini
Hilang ruang untuk cinta yang lain

Separuh jalan pernah dilewati
Meski ada kecewa
Aku yang dulu tak begitu lagi
Takkan kuulangi

Or do you want a new one

I want you

Although there is disappointment
I'm not like that anymore

Remember when we first met?
You said, ""Light my cigarette""
So I lied to my mum and dad
I jumped the fence and I ran
But we couldn't go very far
'Cause you locked your keys in your car
So you sat and stared at my lips
And I could already feel your kiss

Long nights, daydreams
Sugar and smoke rings, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
Headlights on me
Racing to 60, I've been a fool
Strawberries and cigarettes always taste like
Blue eyes, black jeans
Lighters and candy, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you

Remember when you taught me fate?
Said it'd all be worth the wait
Like that night in the back of the cab
When your fingers walked in my hand
Next day, nothin' on my phone
But I can still smell you on my clothes
Always hoping that things would change
But we went right back to your games

Toss romance

Willingly waiting since the sun rises
Can't wait to share
Everything in the heart
Cheer up the heart and make out at the end of the day

Under the seduction of twilight we are in spoiled honey
There are no more beautiful times than youth

Resounding honey humming romance

Living with something that I couldn't see
And somehow fade internally
If you came a long way to get to know me
Or maybe it just meant to be?

Come here I just found a new recipe
The flower, the bricks, and the sea
My intuition says you will like me
And I don't know where should I be?

And maybe you want to be a star?
It may seem you want to be in love
I don't care it taking me apart
But I just couldn't save you tonight

Falling in love is a new world for me
Do you want to be my company?
From thousand of miles you will like it in here
No need, no anniversary

Pertemuan kita nanti saat kau ada di sisiku

Semua kata rindumu semakin membuatku tak berdaya
Menahan rasa ingin jumpa
Percayalah padaku akupun rindu kamu
Ku akan pulang
Melepas semua kerinduan yang terpendam

I received your letter, I have read it, and I understand
How you miss my presence
In your days, together again

you ask me
When will I come back again
You say you can't fight back
Turmoil in the chest
The smoldering holds the taste
We'll meet when you're by my side

All your longing words increasingly make me helpless
Holding the feeling of wanting to see you
Trust me I miss you too
I'm going home
Releasing all pent up longings

You wrote to me, the word love, sweet in your letter
You tell me, ""right now, I want your warm embrace""
And gently caress your love

90,90,90,H.E.R.,Best Part,"19 ContributorsRap Up 2020 Lyrics
Definitely did take a long time
2020 been a sad year
Wasn't gon' even do this
But I figured y'all needed me after everything that been goin' on
The homie Great John on the beat, by the way
Don't Come Outside, Volume 3 out now
Great John on the beat, by the way

I'm a fan Heavenly Father but right now I'm booing you
What did Kobe, Gigi and them other passengers do to you? (What they do?)
My condolences at this time is all I could offer
Kobe got me out here spendin' more time with my daughter (He do)
Takin' Kobe from us had the whole world stressed
You coulda took a average player, not one of the best
Somebody like Lamar Odom or Delonte West (Ah)
I'm just playin', but I'm sayin', we woulda missed them less (God bless)
I'm convinced God don't got the answers
First you take the Black Mamba from us, then the Black Panther (Damn)
Fuck 2020, this whole year started off wack
Best part of the year's here and that's hearin' me rap (You want it)
Hearin' me rap that straight up, 2020's a dub, nigga
Atlanta the only spot that ain't shut down they clubs, nigga (Lord)
Pandemic got niggas eatin' like Action Bronson
They ain't scared of catchin' the corona like Magic Johnson (You did)
Is it real? Is it fake? I don't know, I know shit sad
People dyin' from it off some shit that they been had
They said Trump had it but I think he was fakin' it
They got a vaccine now but I still ain't takin' it (God)
We all saw that nurse who passed out from that shit
Live on TV, miss me with that funny shit
I don't trust the government, they chasin' that fuckin' bag
Whole coronavirus shit feel like a money grab
They tryna get paid, virus is man-made
They actin' like this shit worser than cancer and AIDS (Than cancer)
Kids can't go to school, people can't go to work
Strip clubs closed, bitches ain't got nowhere to twerk (Nah)
Now they lookin' for sponsors, so I'm tellin' chicks, ""I'm broke""
That was prop money on the 'Gram, Kodak Black joke (I ain't got it)
I'm not a big fan of this next line I wrote
I hate the fact I gotta say, ""Rest in peace to Pop Smoke"" (Damn)
The good die young, it really wasn't his time
Him bein' dead and Tekashi still livin' is a crime
God, you gotta do better, you been fuckin' up lately
Bro, all I hear is Pop Smoke when I turn on my radio (Woo)
They play Pop so much it feel like he still here
Got us woo walkin', wearin' Dior just to be clear (Facts)
COVID-19 shit got Fred The Godson
One of the few emcees you could really get bars from
He represented real rap for real New Yorkers
My condolences to your wife and your two daughters
Kings killin' kings and it's bein' filmed on camera
Hated seein' niggas killing King Von in Atlanta (Wack)
Megan sayin' Tory shot her, he sayin' she cappin'
Them people that was in the truck with them told me what happened (They told me)
He wanted that wet-ass pussy, she ain't give him none
She hurt Tory ego and that's when he pulled out a gun
Then she tried to leave and that's when he start clappin'
I made that whole shit up but that sound like what really happened (Haha)
If he really did shoot her, that was some lame shit
She snitchin' now but she a girl so it ain't the same shit (Yeah)
We ain't lookin' at her like how we look at 6ix9ine
Lookin' at Tory like he played himself, fuck was on his mind? (What up?)
That bullet ain't faze her, her leg ain't even hurtin'
A week after she got shot, Meg was back twerkin' (Body-ody-ody-ody)
Been a crazy year, wouldn't you say?
Found out Jada Pinkett gave Will Smith pussy away (She did what?)
Tried to call it an entanglement so it don't sound like nothin'
No, it's called cheatin', Jada, you and August was fuckin' (God)
Got Will Smith out here lookin' like a whole sucker
Wonder how Jaden and Willow feel about they mother (Damn)
Fuck that Red Table, let's discuss some other shit
I wonder if Will asked Jada, did she suck his dick? (Woah)
Now he questionin' how you and 'Pac was out here movin'
He was lookin' stressed at the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air reunion (He was)
Actin' like he give a fuck 'bout how Aunt Viv feel
He probably think that she difficult to work with still (Haha, sheesh)
Cardi B filed for divorce
You know how her and Offset do, they back together, of course (Stop playin')
Dr. Dre wife tried to get two mill' a month
I know Dre happy that she signed that prenup
Dre my nigga, his business all in the street (All in the street)
How much of that man money she tryna keep?
She wasn't with him in the studio makin' them beats
Bitch, you wasn't with me in the studio makin' them beats (Woo)
Put your pussy lips on live, I'll give ya a thousand dollars
Boosie was bein' too thirsty, I'm just bein' honest (He was)
If doin' too much was a person
They deleted his account, now his shit ain't workin' (Damn)
Instagram missin' you, the Internet fuck with you
In that interview with Mike Tyson, you looked uncomfortable
For talkin' 'bout Dwyane Wade's son, he was pressin' you
He was askin' you if you was gay, he was disrespectin' you
Never seen Boosie Badazz talkin' so polite (Never)
He ain't want no smoke with that nigga Iron Mike (Uh-uh)
Woulda looked like Nate Robinson if Mike Tyson hit him
Rest in peace to the homie Mo3 who there with him (Damn)
Couple days after Mo3 died, Boosie got shot
Them Dallas niggas thought Boosie was tryna spin the block (Skrrt)
That nigga Akon was out here trippin'
Tryna explain and justify 6ix9ine snitchin'
I'm locked up, they won't let me out, we felt that
He tried to remix that old-ass record with a rat (You played yourself)
All these rappers gettin' shot, not one bullet hit Tekashi
They really let that nigga out early and kept Bobby (Free Rowdy)

Y'all couldn't wait for this shit to drop
I really entertain y'all with all this shit I pop (I do, right?)
Every year 'round the same time, y'all check for me (Ah)
They like how I disrespect niggas respectfully (True)
Y'all heard what happened, y'all know what happened
But y'all don't care (Y'all don't care)
Y'all still want me to talk about this shit every year (Every year)
Crazy, crazy, shit crazy (I just don't wanna stop, crazy)
Crazy, crazy, shit crazy

Jeezy shouldn't have battled Gucci
Knowin' he was gon' rap about killin' his homie Pookie (Woo)
I get it but fuck all that culture shit
Disrespect my dead homie, I'm poppin' off, battle over with
Try to shoot the nigga up, cut the nigga, at least fuckin' fight
Niggas talk about smokin' on Pookie Loc tonight (Facts)
One of the most disrespectful things that I ever seen
Gucci ignorant but remind me of me when I was seventeen (He do)
Niggas on the streets sayin', ""Jeezy lost it""
That was some sucker shit, he movin' too corporate (Damn)
I ain't with that cool shit, I'm with that ra-ra
JAY-Z wouldn't battle Nas if Nas killed Ty Ty (He wouldn't)
Pookie rollin' over in his grave, you got him hurt
Watchin' you perform with the nigga that put him in the dirt
He prolly got some other issues, leave Jeezy alone
Big Meech brother Southwest T just came home
Let's talk about some shit that got the people upset
Cops that killed Breonna Taylor ain't get arrested yet
Attorney General Daniel Cameron fucked us all up
Them cops that killed Breonna got charged with shootin' the wall up
I repeat, Daniel Cameron is a sell-out
He in a sunken place, like that movie, can't Get Out
Defund the police, Obama said he don't believe in that
In the country where you can't even jog while bein' black (I'm disappointed)
Rest in peace to Ahmaud Arbery
An ex-cop killed him thinkin' he committed a robbery
George Floyd gettin' murdered was on the Internet
For eight minutes straight that cop had his knee on his neck
The whole world came together and protested
They ain't convict him yet but at least they did get arrested (Woo)
Unity was real, government start gettin' scared
We was marchin' like the coronavirus disappeared
White people was out here screamin', ""Black Lives Matter""
And honestly I think that was makin' the police madder (They scared)
And all Donald Trump did was talk about Louis
Nothin' 'bout the knee on the neck and police shootings
He encouraged the police violence
Trump dumbass told us, ""Take Lysol for the virus""
Said it was goin' away, of course he lyin'
Over three hundred thousand Americans done died
Lil Wayne and Lil Pump jumped on Trump dick
Now look, now they look stupid for doin' that dumb shit (They do)
And he lost the election, I know he embarrassed
He know he ain't lose to Joe, he lost to Kamala Harris
Joe Biden knew what he was doin' when he picked her
He knew we was comin' out to vote for a Black sister (We did)
Trump had to go but Joe Biden need to get smacked
For tellin' us if we don't vote for him, we ain't Black
I still think you racist and that's my problem with you
We only voted for you 'cause you got Kamala with you
And I'm not a fan of both of y'all reputations
You and Kamala responsible for mass incarcerations
Y'all the reason they won't leave us alone
The best news we got all year was Rowdy comin' home
It was dope seein' him on Instagram bein' celebrated
He a real one, he ain't fold when he got interrogated
Pharrell was on Drink Champs talkin' some stupid shit
Just 'cause you pay taxes don't make it cool to snitch
I hear about certain shit that make my ass smile
R. Kelly got beat up in jail, good for that pedophile
I'ma miss Donald Trump, can't front, he was funny
Obama gave us trap phones, Trump gave us re-up money
He was makin' y'all laugh too, I'm just remindin' you
He was out here callin' the coronavirus the China flu (It comes from China)
I appreciated that he ain't bite his tongue
If that second stimulus check had came, he mighta won (He mighta)
That unemployment money had y'all feelin' like Big Meech
You was ballin' with that extra six hundred dollars a week (Y'all was)
Bitch, that was better than your regular job
Certain chicks couldn't pay bills unless head was involved
Your OnlyFans page really wasn't poppin' for real
Now you know how a local mixtape rap nigga feel
Them SBA loans had niggas out here in all kinda shit
They was just bums, now they pullin' up with designer shit (Oh, you serious?)
I'ma miss fake beefin' with Casanova
I was about to get on him for fuckin' with Fashion Nova
He prolly like, ""This nigga Murda always gotta play""
I wish he woulda turned himself in after the holidays
Hope I made him laugh while he fightin' for his freedom
Know it's free my nigga Casanova 'til they free him (Oh yeah)
(Is it okay if I call her one?) Who said that shit?
That was Snoop callin' Gayle King a funky dog head bitch
For goin' at Kobe with no consideration
On how his family was feelin' knowin' the situation
LeBron got his fourth ring, you gotta respect his shit
He was tired of hearin' y'all talkin' all that Kawhi Leonard shit
He gon' repeat this year, the Lakers look like a bigger threat
L.A. needed that, they ain't even get over Nipsey yet
That corona had niggas ballin' in a bubble
For James Harden, Houston already got rid of Russell
Y'all be disrespectin' Westbrook, that shit gotta stop
I ain't gon' lie, though, that nigga really don't got no jumpshot (Haha)
Lou Williams left the bubble to go to Magic City for chicken wings
He ain't go there for no ass and titties
Kawhi Leonard and Paul George blew a three-one lead
And Giannis ain't deserve to be the MVP of the league
He get in the playoffs and he look like JaVale McGee
I know that's disrespectful but I mean that respectfully
Brooklyn is litty with KD and Kyrie
Madison Square Garden disrespectin' Spike Lee ('Cause no one told me)
Deontay Wilder lost his first fight
He got beat up by Tyson, I ain't talkin' 'bout Mike
Oh, the Tyson that he got beat up by was white (Was white)
(To this day) Can't believe he got beat up that night
Adrien Broner was on the ""Catch Me Outside"" girl page
In her DM, oh, he ain't know she was underage (What?)
Floyd Mayweather struggled saying ""epidemic""
Everyday Struggle got canceled, they fired Akademiks
We saw Wack 100 knockin' out a racist cracker
They tried to jump him like they ain't know Black Lives Matter (Haha)
Supposedly Kanye worth around three bill'
But that ain't stoppin' him from tweetin' about how he feel
He been tryna leave Kim since he met up with Meek Mill
He think Drake fucked her too and him and JAY don't speak still
Y'all couldn't wait for this time to come
Y'all already know that that nigga Murda don't bite his tongue (I don't)
You forgot about Nick Gordon, no, I didn't
So what? He dead, we ain't care about him when he was livin'
Always blamed him for Bobbi Kristina dyin'
So to act like I care that he dead, I'd be lyin'
My newborn was born on Valentine's Day
That's the best gift a nigga coulda got, what more could I say?
Nicki had a baby, congratulations
Her husband and Meek almost got in an altercation
They shoulda just got it on, like, nobody get the blicky
It woulda been funny watchin' them fightin' over Nicki
Cardi B and Megan had conservatives tryna ban 'em
For that wet-ass pussy record, then it became an anthem
Y'all couldn't wait for this shit to drop
I really entertain y'all with all this shit I pop (I do)
Every year 'round the same time, y'all check for me (Uh-huh)
They like how I disrespect niggas respectfully (Haha)

Michael B. Jordan fuckin' Lori Harvey
I was on MSNBC with Ari (Woah)
Talkin' 'bout Trump gettin' impeached
We was politickin', look how far the Rap Up done reached
The first debate with Trump and Joe Biden was comedy
That's when I realized we gon' be fucked either way, honestly
Oprah and Gayle King still don't realize why we upset
We realize they ain't talk about Harvey Weinstein yet
Fuck whoever not with us, nigga, that's how I play
Rest in peace to that nigga Deebo from Friday
I hate 2020, this whole year had a nigga tight
Can't believe I'm sayin' rest in peace to my nigga Light
Dave East, where you at, homie? I hope you listenin'
Told my nigga Light to tell Shooter you fuckin' missin' him
Condolences to your fam' and your niggas in Queensbridge
We was gon' shoot a video for the record we did
Can't believe I'm tellin' my nigga Hank, ""Rest in peace""
Believe me when I tell you that this year was stressin' me (It was)
This year I really wasn't even gon' do this shit
Wasn't in the mood to laugh and joke about no stupid shit (Wasn't)
Then niggas just kept doin' stupid shit
Then I saw that Snoop Dogg post, like, I gotta do this shit (Okay)
Flex lost weight but he ain't do it the hard way
That nigga cheated, he went and got lipo' like Kanye
So many rappers got shot, I could be here forever
Joey Dollas got hit up, I hope he get better (Damn)

Real talk, I wrote this shit while I was Jada drunk (I did)

Lil Baby got money so it's cool if he like to trick
It wasn't sixteen bands, though, bitch, it was only six

How you gon' give them kids from Atlanta a $20 to split?
How nobody ain't whip Akademik ass yet?
On Clubhouse, Meek told him he got his address (Ha)

50 got a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame
JAY-Z distributin' marijuana

But I was in that motherfuckin' booth gettin' tired
Like LeBron said, I want my damn respect
R.I.P. to the homie Alex Trebek
Shit crazy, nigga, this year was hard as hell
Icons died, rest in peace to Andre Harrell
Without him it wouldn't have been no Diddy (Wouldn't have)
So that mean it probably wouldn't have been no Biggie (Facts)
You see how important he was? So that shit hit me

They ain't scared of catchin' the corona like Magic Johnson (You did)
Is it real? Is it fake? I don't know, I know shit sad
People dyin' from it off some shit that they been had
They said Trump had it but I think he was fakin' it
They got a vaccine now but I still ain't takin' it (God)
We all saw that nurse who passed out from that shit
Live on TV, miss me with that funny shit

Whole coronavirus shit feel like a money grab
They tryna get paid, virus is man-made
They actin' like this shit worser than cancer and AIDS (Than cancer)
Kids can't go to school, people can't go to work
Strip clubs closed, bitches ain't got nowhere to twerk (Nah)
Now they lookin' for sponsors, so I'm tellin' chicks, ""I'm broke""
That was prop money on the 'Gram, Kodak Black joke (I ain't got it)
I'm not a big fan of this next line I wrote
I hate the fact I gotta say, ""Rest in peace to Pop Smoke"" (Damn)
The good die young, it really wasn't his time
Him bein' dead and Tekashi still livin' is a crime
God, you gotta do better, you been fuckin' up lately
Bro, all I hear is Pop Smoke when I turn on my radio (Woo)
They play Pop so much it feel like he still here
Got us woo walkin', wearin' Dior just to be clear (Facts)

My condolences to your wife and your two daughters
Kings killin' kings and it's bein' filmed on camera
Hated seein' niggas killing King Von in Atlanta (Wack)
Megan sayin' Tory shot her, he sayin' she cappin'
Them people that was in the truck with them told me what happened (They told me)
He wanted that wet-ass pussy, she ain't give him none
She hurt Tory ego and that's when he pulled out a gun
Then she tried to leave and that's when he start clappin'
I made that whole shit up but that sound like what really happened (Haha)
If he really did shoot her, that was some lame shit
She snitchin' now but she a girl so it ain't the same shit (Yeah)
We ain't lookin' at her like how we look at 6ix9ine
Lookin' at Tory like he played himself, fuck was on his mind? (What up?)
That bullet ain't faze her, her leg ain't even hurtin'
A week after she got shot, Meg was back twerkin' (Body-ody-ody-ody)
Been a crazy year, wouldn't you say?
Found out Jada Pinkett gave Will Smith pussy away (She did what?)
Tried to call it an entanglement so it don't sound like nothin'

Dr. Dre wife tried to get two mill' a month
I know Dre happy that she signed that prenup
Dre my nigga, his business all in the street (All in the street)
How much of that man money she tryna keep?
She wasn't with him in the studio makin' them beats
Bitch, you wasn't with me in the studio makin' them beats (Woo)
Put your pussy lips on live, I'll give ya a thousand dollars
Boosie was bein' too thirsty, I'm just bein' honest (He was)
If doin' too much was a person
They deleted his account, now his shit ain't workin' (Damn)
Instagram missin' you, the Internet fuck with you
In that interview with Mike Tyson, you looked uncomfortable
For talkin' 'bout Dwyane Wade's son, he was pressin' you
He was askin' you if you was gay, he was disrespectin' you
Never seen Boosie Badazz talkin' so polite (Never)
He ain't want no smoke with that nigga Iron Mike (Uh-uh)
Woulda looked like Nate Robinson if Mike Tyson hit him
Rest in peace to the homie Mo3 who there with him (Damn)
Couple days after Mo3 died, Boosie got shot
Them Dallas niggas thought Boosie was tryna spin the block (Skrrt)
That nigga Akon was out here trippin'
Tryna explain and justify 6ix9ine snitchin'
I'm locked up, they won't let me out, we felt that
He tried to remix that old-ass record with a rat (You played yourself)
All these rappers gettin' shot, not one bullet hit Tekashi

Big Meech brother Southwest T just came home
Let's talk about some shit that got the people upset
Cops that killed Breonna Taylor ain't get arrested yet
Attorney General Daniel Cameron fucked us all up
Them cops that killed Breonna got charged with shootin' the wall up
I repeat, Daniel Cameron is a sell-out
He in a sunken place, like that movie, can't Get Out
Defund the police, Obama said he don't believe in that
In the country where you can't even jog while bein' black (I'm disappointed)
Rest in peace to Ahmaud Arbery
An ex-cop killed him thinkin' he committed a robbery
George Floyd gettin' murdered was on the Internet
For eight minutes straight that cop had his knee on his neck
The whole world came together and protested
They ain't convict him yet but at least they did get arrested (Woo)
Unity was real, government start gettin' scared
We was marchin' like the coronavirus disappeared
White people was out here screamin', ""Black Lives Matter""
And honestly I think that was makin' the police madder (They scared)
And all Donald Trump did was talk about Louis
Nothin' 'bout the knee on the neck and police shootings
He encouraged the police violence
Trump dumbass told us, ""Take Lysol for the virus""
Said it was goin' away, of course he lyin'
Over three hundred thousand Americans done died
Lil Wayne and Lil Pump jumped on Trump dick
Now look, now they look stupid for doin' that dumb shit (They do)
And he lost the election, I know he embarrassed
He know he ain't lose to Joe, he lost to Kamala Harris
Joe Biden knew what he was doin' when he picked her
He knew we was comin' out to vote for a Black sister (We did)
Trump had to go but Joe Biden need to get smacked
For tellin' us if we don't vote for him, we ain't Black
I still think you racist and that's my problem with you
We only voted for you 'cause you got Kamala with you
And I'm not a fan of both of y'all reputations
You and Kamala responsible for mass incarcerations
Y'all the reason they won't leave us alone

It was dope seein' him on Instagram bein' celebrated

Just 'cause you pay taxes don't make it cool to snitch
I hear about certain shit that make my ass smile
R. Kelly got beat up in jail, good for that pedophile
I'ma miss Donald Trump, can't front, he was funny
Obama gave us trap phones, Trump gave us re-up money
He was makin' y'all laugh too, I'm just remindin' you
He was out here callin' the coronavirus the China flu (It comes from China)
I appreciated that he ain't bite his tongue
If that second stimulus check had came, he mighta won (He mighta)

You was ballin' with that extra six hundred dollars a week (Y'all was)

Now you know how a local mixtape rap nigga feel
Them SBA loans had niggas out here in all kinda shit
They was just bums, now they pullin' up with designer shit (Oh, you serious?)
I'ma miss fake beefin' with Casanova
I was about to get on him for fuckin' with Fashion Nova
He prolly like, ""This nigga Murda always gotta play""
I wish he woulda turned himself in after the holidays
Hope I made him laugh while he fightin' for his freedom
Know it's free my nigga Casanova 'til they free him (Oh yeah)
(Is it okay if I call her one?) Who said that shit?
That was Snoop callin' Gayle King a funky dog head bitch

Lou Williams left the bubble to go to Magic City for chicken wings
He ain't go there for no ass and titties
Kawhi Leonard and Paul George blew a three-one lead

They tried to jump him like they ain't know Black Lives Matter (Haha)
Supposedly Kanye worth around three bill'

He been tryna leave Kim since he met up with Meek Mill
He think Drake fucked her too and him and JAY don't speak still
Y'all couldn't wait for this time to come
Y'all already know that that nigga Murda don't bite his tongue (I don't)
You forgot about Nick Gordon, no, I didn't
So what? He dead, we ain't care about him when he was livin'
Always blamed him for Bobbi Kristina dyin'

My newborn was born on Valentine's Day
That's the best gift a nigga coulda got, what more could I say?
Nicki had a baby, congratulations
Her husband and Meek almost got in an altercation
They shoulda just got it on, like, nobody get the blicky
It woulda been funny watchin' them fightin' over Nicki
Cardi B and Megan had conservatives tryna ban 'em
For that wet-ass pussy record, then it became an anthem
Y'all couldn't wait for this shit to drop
I really entertain y'all with all this shit I pop (I do)
Every year 'round the same time, y'all check for me (Uh-huh)
They like how I disrespect niggas respectfully (Haha)

The first debate with Trump and Joe Biden was comedy

91,91,91,Neck Deep,Wish You Were Here,"24 ContributorsWish You Were Here Lyrics
Take it slow
Tell me all how you've grown, just for me
Could we all reminisce?
Better yet, here's a pen
Make a list
Fill it full with all the things I've missed
'Cause I could barely drive past the school
Without stopping to think of you
And how we used to act the fool
But worst of all I wish I'd called
At least a thousand times or more
Just to hear what I've been missing
If a picture is all that I have
I can picture the times that we won't get back
If I picture it now it don't seem so bad
Either way, I still wish you were here
Don't say everything's meant to be
'Cause you know it's not what I believe
Can't help but think that it should've been me
Either way, I still wish you were here
Thinking back on the days
Where we all used to say
""I know anywhere's better than here""
In the back of the class
Where we grew up too fast
Living life like there's nothing to fear
But the ice on the road
Driving home all alone
Singing along to a song from three summers ago
The one that made you remember it
Now I'll always remember it (I'll always remember it)
As the song that your life ended with
You might also like
If a picture is all that I have
I can picture the times that we won't get back
If I picture it now it don't seem so bad
Either way, I still wish you were here
Don't say everything's meant to be
'Cause you know it's not what I believe
Can't help but think that it should've been me
Either way, I still wish you were here

And they say you're in a better place
(They say you're in a better place)
But a better place is right here with me
Yeah, they say you're in a better place
(They say you're in a better place)
Too bad it's not what I believe
'Cause a picture is all that I have
To remind me that you're never coming back
If I picture it now it just makes me sad
And right now I just wish you were here
Don't say everything's meant to be
'Cause you know it's not what I believe
Can't help but think that it should've been me
In the end, I just wish you were here
Yeah they say you're in a better place
They say you're in a better place
Either way, I still wish you were here
They say you're in a better place
They say you're in a better place
In the end, I just wish you were here8Embed","24 ContributorsWish You Were Here Lyrics

""I know anywhere's better than here""
In the back of the class
Where we grew up too fast
Living life like there's nothing to fear
But the ice on the road
Driving home all alone
Singing along to a song from three summers ago
The one that made you remember it
Now I'll always remember it (I'll always remember it)
As the song that your life ended with

If a picture is all that I have
I can picture the times that we won't get back
If I picture it now it don't seem so bad
Either way, I still wish you were here
Don't say everything's meant to be
'Cause you know it's not what I believe
Can't help but think that it should've been me
Either way, I still wish you were here

And they say you're in a better place
(They say you're in a better place)
But a better place is right here with me
Yeah, they say you're in a better place
(They say you're in a better place)
Too bad it's not what I believe
'Cause a picture is all that I have
To remind me that you're never coming back
If I picture it now it just makes me sad
And right now I just wish you were here
Don't say everything's meant to be
'Cause you know it's not what I believe
Can't help but think that it should've been me
In the end, I just wish you were here
Yeah they say you're in a better place

Lembut tutur katamu, merdu tawamu

Pilihan yang terbaikEmbed","2 Contributors The Best Choice of Lyrics

Why keep pushing
Survive only hurt
We don't feel the same anymore
No longer love each other

Indeed we have long
But what does that mean
Love but tormented
It won't be comfortable

Do not force it
When everything was different
Why keep it
If we don't get along
Do not blame
For all the memories
This farewell
Best choice

Why are you still holding on
If you keep getting hurt
In fact, the heart is different
Let me go to be happy

It started with a kiss
On your mama's couch
2012 was nothing serious
And then we caught the feels
It got really real
Too good to be true
I guess I thought you was, yeah

Why did I run away, run away, run away?
Oh, your love was everything, everything, everything
I know it's gettin' late, gettin' late, gettin' late
But can I still be on my way, on my way? Yeah

I know I said goodbye and, baby, you said it too
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you
I thought that I'd be better when I found someone new
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you

I'm familiar with unrequited
I know you got a heart that's undecided just like mine
It takes its sweet time
I been shy to dive into the deep end
'Cause I don't really wanna lose a good friend, but I might
Find something divine

It's electric every time we touch
I've been living for this head rush
But sometimes it's too much

If we never try
How will we know
Baby, how far this thing could go
Give me a sign
If I'm on your mind
I don't want to fall in love alone

I wish that I could tell what you were thinking
I hate that I slip up when I've been drinking, but oh wеll
I can't help myself

Not knowin' what it was

But, darlin', just kiss me slow

And in your eyes, you're holdin' mine

Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darlin', you look perfect tonight

She shares my dreams, I hope that, someday, I'll share her home

To carry love, to carry children of our own

'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But, darlin', just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holdin' mine

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darlin', you look perfect tonight

Well, I found a woman stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that, someday, I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fightin' against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darlin', just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress, lookin' so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darlin', you look perfect tonight

No, no, no
Mm, no, no

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
We're barefoot on the grass, oh, listenin' to our favourite song

I fell by the wayside like everyone else
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, but I was just kidding myself
Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone, all I hear are the words that I needed to say

When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal, but this won't

So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'da known you had a storm to weather
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So before you go

Was never the right time whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face

Aku kesal dengan jarak yang sering memisahkan kita
Hingga aku hanya bisa berbincang denganmu di Whatsapp
Aku kesal dengan waktu yang tak pernah berhenti bergerak
Barang sejenak agar aku bisa menikmati tawamu

Inginku berdiri di sebelahmu menggenggam erat jari-jarimu
Mendengarkan lagu Sheila on 7 seperti waktu itu
Saat kau di sisiku

Dan tunggulah aku di sana memecahkan celengan rinduku
Berboncengan denganmu mengelilingi kota
Menikmati surya perlahan menghilang
Hingga kejamnya waktu menarik paksa kau dari pelukku
Lalu kita kembali menabung rasa rindu
Saling mengirim doa, sampai nanti, Sayangku

Jangan matikan HP-mu
Kau tahu aku benci khawatir saat kau tak mengabari
Aku tak suka bertanya-tanya

Ingin kubakar dia yang sering mention-mention-an denganmu di Twitter
Namun kau selalu meyakinkanku 'tuk tumbuhkan percaya

I'm annoyed by the distance that often separates us
Until I can only talk to you on Whatsapp
I'm annoyed with the time that never stops moving
Just for a moment so I can enjoy your laugh

I want to stand next to you holding your fingers tightly
Listening to the song Sheila on 7 like that time
When you're by my side

And wait for me there to break my longing piggy bank
ride with you around town
Enjoying the sun slowly disappears
Until the cruel time pulled you from my embrace
Then we return to saving longing
Sending prayers to each other, until later, my dear

Don't turn off your HP
You know I hate to worry when you don't talk
I don't like asking questions

I want to burn him who often mentions you on Twitter
But you always convince me to grow trust

And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them

Sudah saatnya kau tengok puing yang tertinggal
Sampai kapan akan selalu berlari?
Hingga kini masih selalu ku nanti-nanti

Terbawa lagi langkahku ke sana

Ku percaya selalu ada sesuatu di Jogja

Izinkan aku pulang ke kotamu

Hey beautiful, try to note
My train arrives at four in the afternoon
You don't have to ask me to tell you later
Hey beautiful, where have you been?
No news, little story

And Jakarta is sad to lose you
The city lights are no longer the same
It's time for you to look at the debris left behind
Until when will it always run?
Until now, I still look forward to it

I got this scouting report on Dumb' and I can make it go left
No sweat
I'll turn this shit into a Game Of Thrones set
Bro test, we gon' bet, I'm takin' his whole check
Funny how I'm three bars in and I still haven't cracked an Asian joke yet
I'm the greatest of all time
Most creative of all time
Check the history, I cross ""T's"" and dot the small ""I's"" (eyes)
No racist shit, those narrow views are not mine
Like a North Korean nuke boy, that shit will not fly
His real name is John Park
And you were off to a hot start
But then you named yourself ""Dumb"" that makes me think you're...not smart
You listen to his music you think his vibe was all dark
But he's got the personality of a greeter at Wal-Mart
Well it's goin' down
Like a bell of danger in an elevator
Fuck, an intercom in a generator
I'll put the yellow Ranger on a ventilator
The original king
I'm Cedric The Entertainer with the pen and paper
I'll educate your casuals, I'm John Madden through the Telestrator
You're a pencil pusher with a calculator
A Now N Later to an alligator
I'm a Hall of Famer, bitch you watch the Lakers
If I need a favor then I call the Lakers
(Or the Bulls. Or the Bulls)
In my last battle I wore Dions, within a year I was bros with him
I name dropped Pat Bev', within two I had a show with him
Manifesting, I got the future in my hands and I'm moldin' it
If I had name dropped Jesus Christ he probably would've rose again
I'm at the podium, barkin' like a Doberman
Some kung-fu put Bong Joon-Ho through the linoleum
You had three Anderson.Paak beats and you still couldn't blow with 'em
Now he's an MSG and this pussy is throwin' sodium
Well I hear all the trap from these seedy suckers
But I pretend I don't see it like I'm Stevie Wonder
We're opposites, there's no way we could see each other
You're Asian...bitch I'm gettin' even younger
But growin' up I bet there's painful memories you can't jog
Like goin' to the rub and tug to get a hand job and it's your grandma
And that's a hell of a quandary when you have your dick out
Do you dismount?
Do you ask for the family discount?
You're not descended from Kublai Khan, you're a waiter at Buddakan
So pay attention who's Louie Vuitton's you've been spillin' those noodles on
It's the rap game's Siroc, the way that I paint with dots
Find me dumpin' a Machine Gun like Megan Fox
We could box
Find him slumped down in that vacant lot
You can't tell if he's slumped out or if he's doin' the Asian squat
On Twitter, November 9th, 2018
You said, ""If I ever go broke I'll hop back in that ring.""
Well I'm glad that you're here but I'm sorry you're back
Welcome home Dumb', let me know if you need to borrow some cash

You're right, I had no part in Anderson's future
You hang with Anderson Cooper
By the way I've seen your wife, her body is smokin'
When I fuck her you can watch, I'll leave the door open
Keep up with the references don't get lost
I'll fuck the wedding ring off her, call her Silk Sonic The Hedgehog
I said, the King has returned to the Dot
Korean Jesus is home
All these lazy rappers usin' Asian accents, finally they leave me a Rone (alone)
I came for Pat Stay tonight to celebrate his life
I know two wrongs don't make a right but maybe killin' one Rone can make it right
You really thought you was pushin' forward the whole culture
I work for myself, y'all work for old vultures
It's funny how Lush went to Adam22 but you're the one with No Jumper
Y'all chauffer's, Driving Miss Daisy's with your boss in the backseat
I know that y'all can't sleep knowin' you exploit black rappers and athletes
But at Bar Stool you're killin' it bravo
But the only real ones from Philly that I know are Gilly and Wallo
I bet you went to the office on the first day
Like, ""Hey fellas. Bang Bang Bird Gang""
Like you just learned slang
Yeah get it through ya nerd brain, you're lame
Your only black friend is Pat Bev'
And on that show you won't even let Pat talk
How your Roots in Philly but you won't even listen to a Black Thought
You must've lost your marbles or insane
Give me the green light, I'll slap the shit out of him, hit a lick on a cracker like Squid Game
I'll call his bluff, like Parasite sneak in his crazy rich parent's house when they've gone to brunch
Shang-Chi Ten Rings, I'll break Everything, Everywhere, All At Once
I'm sick of ya tired puns
They've already been all done
There's only so many ways you can be called ""Dumb""
But I don't gotta use name flips to call you bitch cause you already are one (R-one)
You're an enormous geek
With ya Old Navy performance fleece
What is that? Mormon chic?
I hate dorks that can't play sports but wear official game shorts
But he chose to stand on the sidelines that was a good call
Look y'all, the only dude to get injured in Fantasy Football
You wanna know how I know you're a loser bro?
Two words: Super Bowl
Y'all lost to the Chiefs, I know that shit Jalen Hurts
It was damn near reparations seeing the natives take it first
To make it worse, Jalen's ankle worked
This guy came to work with a Philly Championship tee cause he pre-made the shirt
You damn near lose to every Patrick that ya know
So do us all a favor and take ya ass ma homes (Mahomes)
Bro you have the tiniest...set of nostrils
I can't tell if it's cool if it's lame
On one hand you stay duckin' diseases, on the other you do love cocaine
And I'm not judgin', it's just the way his face was designed
But if you're gonna share drugs, plan on takin' your time
Cause when everybody else is out breakin' out lines, he gotta snort his cocaine one grain at a time
He breathes in it sounds like a long range missile
We breathes out it sounds like a fuckin' train whistle
They tried to rape this dude it would've been a terrible day
He just exhaled hard and it scared 'em away
Fuckin' square ass head brother, who are you?
The offspring of Lucy Liu and Rubik's Cube?
Who is your uncle Ahk?
A fuckin' Funko Pop?
My boy's a Lego best believe he runs a couple blocks
And I'm not even hatin' bro I like that
Lookin' like a fine ass character from Minecraft
But it's gettin' hard to tell what kind of accent he's flexin'
You got a weird twang like a Cantonese Texan
I'll leave you cryin' in H Mart like Japanese breakfast
I got the smoke like fajitas in ya Applebees section
I'll split his dumpling once that .50 peel
BAOW! You just got yourself a Disney deal
My bro's mad? I'm poppin' up in his bitch, be real
She throw it back like a homer at Wrigley Field
I'll give her 15 bucks and she'll lick these nuts
Your girl is a ho by name and your mom's Kim She (Kimchi) Sucks
Dumb must be dump if he's thinkin' he's at the top
You might think he's fish scale, from how I see it it has to stop
You might think that he's raw, from how I see it that shit's chop
You might see Dumb' as a brick, I see Dumb' as a bag of rocks
And doom is imminent bitch, you can see the shark tail
You try to drag race me, I'll put your Civic through a guardrail
Dumb's dumb as a hammer, you would buy at a yard sale
I'll put this battle in a coffin and use Dumb' as a doornail
But wait, wait, wait
He said his ten year goal was to start in an action movie
That's a doozie
You're 5'6"" and a half with boobies
The closest you ever get to an action movie is if they remake Cars and you voice a hatchback Suzuki
Or in Mickey Mouse as a Mandarin Goofy
Or in Veggie Tales as a sushi
Let's go through a checklist for an action hero
Athleticism? That's a zero
Acting chops aren't half Dinero
Sex appeal is Dan DeVito
Stop it Chino, the closest you ever get to an action hero is gettin'  Frappuccino for Al Pacino
Bro, and it's not because you're Asian, they just don't like suckin'
20 indie movies in and now you wanna try stuntin'?
Indie 50, indie 60, you might realize something
You keep playin' that race card you might hit indie (Indy) 500
Bro, on Twitter, November 9th, 2018
You said, ""If I ever go broke I'll hop back in that ring.""
Well I already gave you a $20 that's just me bein' decent
So pay me back when you get that action flick, matter of fact, keep it
When we were yellin' ""Black Lives Matter"" tryin' to stop Asian hate
You were storming the capitol tryin' to keep Caucasian's safe
In Ferguson you thought the cops saved the day
With Breonna Taylor you would not say her name
You were mad as shit at Kaepernick you little sports boy
You won't take one knee for George Floyd but I bet you take two for knees for David Portnoy
I just know your mom's a Karen, they call her ""Ka-rone""
All on the phone, nagging tone
Wouldn't even let you rap alone unless she chaperones
She can't condone any rapper with a blacker tone...than Charron
You hated Kanye, you wouldn't even slap his songs until he appeared on Alex Jones
You've been a weirdo, I bet ya hero is Ben Shapiro
And he hate woke bitches, I can't make that up
Nah, I mean like he hates woke bitches like, he likes the ones that can't get up off a date rape drug
I'm not sayin' you're a racist person
I'm just sayin' that he dressed up as Meek Mill and got the make-up perfect
You know, Trudeau
His favorite movie is Rocky 3 but he won't be caught dead watchin' Creed
But he'll rewatch the scene where Apollo dies in the boxing ring
It's funny how when a black man got the lead he's like, ""Mmmm. Not for me.""
Trippin' about the Little Mermaid, imagine that scenario
A grown man mad about Ariel
When they considered Idris Elba for James Bond he was like, ""God damn it. the whole thang's wrong.""
Bro that's weird
You got so much black fear you won't even watch Black Mirror
I asked him if he saw Get Out
He said, ""Nope""
The great white hope with a face like the pope
You see you're not really helpin' the people when you don't see no one else as an equal
That's why you'll never get the ring, you're a Philadelphia Smeagol

As a ""cis white male"" I acknowledge that my existence is inherently racist
I've read the books, I've done the work and I can finally face it
And it's not racist like I think one side has better genetics
But like, I don't think you have a black fan that doesn't have a tentacle fetish
Now, is that wrong? Yes, it's bigoted and selfish
But since all white people are inherently racist, I guess I can't help it
No, no, no, no, no
Even though it's been underground I still look like a fuckin' clown
And it's been wrong, cause as the majority I was punching down
And I felt bad
Was I part of this massive machine?
Cutting off the culture before they could advance and succeed?
So I took chances to read, all the fantastic cuisine
All the history, I damn near traced it back to Adam and G
And on the global scale, all the demographics are deep
6 out of 10 of all people come from back in the east
So if 3 out of 5 are Asian that mathematically means
The real minority here is...actually me?
And I'm feeling marginalized
I need some acknowledgement
This feelings hard to describe
I might need a scholarship
This shit is tough to ignore
And not to run up the score
But since I'm not punching down then my Asian jokes are fucked up anymore
So you know what rhymes with ""Fu manchu""?
(What?!)
""Wuhan Flu""
All your faces look the same like the Blue Man Group
I know COVID fucked up your diet, you can barely eat at all
Cause when you heard it was made in a lab, you were thinking the breed of dog
You'll turn a PetSmart to a wet mart, so aggressively
And your cultural specialty was adding kimchi to the COVID recipe
Wait, I say that for a reason
In a movie called Bad Rap you gave battle rap a bad rap
Right after it made you famous, it got stabbed in the damn back
You claimed the premise was racist, like you didn't advance that?
Like we're not just roasting? Someone get him a Tampax
You've had Mexican jokes, Arab jokes, like that shit was usual
You versus an Asian guy was like the stereotype Super Bowl
You told a black guy that they'd serve fried chicken at his funeral
And the worst part is, I thought that shit was beautiful!
But it's his reasoning that puts my mind into a pretzel
He said, ""Tiger Moms, good at math. All these stereotypes are stressful
They keep callin' me a doctor. It's a bit disrespectful
I might quit battle rap if they keep calling me...rich and successful.""
And it's the most benign insult
They said, ""Rice eater. It's the worst.""
Oh, they said you eat the most popular food on Earth?
See, every chopstick joke isn't a hate crime
We're different, that's cool, it's not a story for Dateline
And that's why I'm not concerned with playin' Dumb' online
Cause you never know when the man above calls ""Time!""
Hey Pat!
Look what we did in your name
We miss you everyday bro, shit isn't the same
I wish you were here to help us through this scariness
And cause Soul Khan is bi now it's hilarious
Bro, I wish I could just call you we could roast the shit for weeks
Bi-ass Jew doin' circumcisions with his teeth
So until the day we can call him ""gay"" together
We got your fam', we're hold your flame, Pat Stay Forever

I went from booze bin to juice cleanse, I'm feelin' like a new man
I know it makes you sick like I flew in from Wuhan to get the W like a Wu fan
No chance
I came outta an AA meeting ready to throw hands
And stomp ya with my sponsor, now that's a 12 step program
For the last two weeks I fasted
I got the sober life mastered
Close my eyes, frozen time, know the fly catch shit
It's like Bruce Lee, flow like water, ocean tide
This is...beats me, season 4 or 5 of Kobra Kai
You see a few years ago I took him to LA, I was his tour guide
And boy you never seen nobody more white
That shit felt like Training Day
It was Denzel and the incel
He thought we was in the jungles, I was like, ""Bro. This is Glendale.""
You know it don't end well when we at the karaoke singin' 'Thug Mansion' wearing Oakley's
You would've sworn we were at Lollapalooza
He was bowing at everybody, homie, we are not the Yakuza
I said, ""Fuck it. Let's get some drugs.""
We did some bumps, he started mixing pixie dust in bitches Dixie cups
We needed a little pick me up
He literally had to pick her up, that shit was sus'
Y'all really think I'ma get dissed by this bitch?
Who is this? Mid-Twist?
You're 33 and had to pledge in a fraternity for eternity
Before journalism, you were journaling
Now you're an Anchorman; Ron Burgundy
I just wanna slap that snapback hat off bro
Lookin' like a wack backpack frat Jack Harlow
I know for the past few months you were on your computer like, ""Write me a battle rap chatGPT
Ahhh. Revise that. Make it more like a frat SMACK DVD
Good. Now change it to the cadence of my favorite rapper
Great. Now give me a list of famous Asian actors
Neat
Now take this bar and change it backwards
And put a bunch of bullshit in the middle same as Dizaster
Sweet.""
Now ask it about me, my jersey hangs in the rafters
Your status is questionable, maybe A.I. ain't the Answer
You see, matter of fact, I peeped your plan of attack
Since you were on Twitter telling everybody I was your fantasy match
Bro, I don't give a fuck about you, I came back to battle for Pat
That's why I got Pat on the front
You just wanted a Pat on the backEmbed","2 ContributorsDumbfoundead vs. Rone Lyrics
I got this scouting report on Dumb' and I can make it go left
No sweat
I'll turn this shit into a Game Of Thrones set
Bro test, we gon' bet, I'm takin' his whole check
Funny how I'm three bars in and I still haven't cracked an Asian joke yet
I'm the greatest of all time
Most creative of all time
Check the history, I cross ""T's"" and dot the small ""I's"" (eyes)
No racist shit, those narrow views are not mine
Like a North Korean nuke boy, that shit will not fly
His real name is John Park
And you were off to a hot start
But then you named yourself ""Dumb"" that makes me think you're...not smart
You listen to his music you think his vibe was all dark
But he's got the personality of a greeter at Wal-Mart
Well it's goin' down
Like a bell of danger in an elevator
Fuck, an intercom in a generator
I'll put the yellow Ranger on a ventilator
The original king
I'm Cedric The Entertainer with the pen and paper
I'll educate your casuals, I'm John Madden through the Telestrator
You're a pencil pusher with a calculator
A Now N Later to an alligator
I'm a Hall of Famer, bitch you watch the Lakers
If I need a favor then I call the Lakers
(Or the Bulls. Or the Bulls)
In my last battle I wore Dions, within a year I was bros with him
I name dropped Pat Bev', within two I had a show with him
Manifesting, I got the future in my hands and I'm moldin' it
If I had name dropped Jesus Christ he probably would've rose again
I'm at the podium, barkin' like a Doberman
Some kung-fu put Bong Joon-Ho through the linoleum
You had three Anderson.Paak beats and you still couldn't blow with 'em
Now he's an MSG and this pussy is throwin' sodium
Well I hear all the trap from these seedy suckers
But I pretend I don't see it like I'm Stevie Wonder
We're opposites, there's no way we could see each other
You're Asian...bitch I'm gettin' even younger
But growin' up I bet there's painful memories you can't jog
Like goin' to the rub and tug to get a hand job and it's your grandma
And that's a hell of a quandary when you have your dick out
Do you dismount?
Do you ask for the family discount?
You're not descended from Kublai Khan, you're a waiter at Buddakan
So pay attention who's Louie Vuitton's you've been spillin' those noodles on
It's the rap game's Siroc, the way that I paint with dots
Find me dumpin' a Machine Gun like Megan Fox
We could box
Find him slumped down in that vacant lot
You can't tell if he's slumped out or if he's doin' the Asian squat
On Twitter, November 9th, 2018
You said, ""If I ever go broke I'll hop back in that ring.""
Well I'm glad that you're here but I'm sorry you're back
Welcome home Dumb', let me know if you need to borrow some cash
You might also like
You're right, I had no part in Anderson's future
You hang with Anderson Cooper
By the way I've seen your wife, her body is smokin'
When I fuck her you can watch, I'll leave the door open
Keep up with the references don't get lost
I'll fuck the wedding ring off her, call her Silk Sonic The Hedgehog
I said, the King has returned to the Dot
Korean Jesus is home
All these lazy rappers usin' Asian accents, finally they leave me a Rone (alone)
I came for Pat Stay tonight to celebrate his life
I know two wrongs don't make a right but maybe killin' one Rone can make it right
You really thought you was pushin' forward the whole culture
I work for myself, y'all work for old vultures
It's funny how Lush went to Adam22 but you're the one with No Jumper
Y'all chauffer's, Driving Miss Daisy's with your boss in the backseat
I know that y'all can't sleep knowin' you exploit black rappers and athletes
But at Bar Stool you're killin' it bravo
But the only real ones from Philly that I know are Gilly and Wallo
I bet you went to the office on the first day
Like, ""Hey fellas. Bang Bang Bird Gang""
Like you just learned slang
Yeah get it through ya nerd brain, you're lame
Your only black friend is Pat Bev'
And on that show you won't even let Pat talk
How your Roots in Philly but you won't even listen to a Black Thought
You must've lost your marbles or insane
Give me the green light, I'll slap the shit out of him, hit a lick on a cracker like Squid Game
I'll call his bluff, like Parasite sneak in his crazy rich parent's house when they've gone to brunch
Shang-Chi Ten Rings, I'll break Everything, Everywhere, All At Once
I'm sick of ya tired puns
They've already been all done
There's only so many ways you can be called ""Dumb""
But I don't gotta use name flips to call you bitch cause you already are one (R-one)
You're an enormous geek
With ya Old Navy performance fleece
What is that? Mormon chic?
I hate dorks that can't play sports but wear official game shorts
But he chose to stand on the sidelines that was a good call
Look y'all, the only dude to get injured in Fantasy Football
You wanna know how I know you're a loser bro?
Two words: Super Bowl
Y'all lost to the Chiefs, I know that shit Jalen Hurts
It was damn near reparations seeing the natives take it first
To make it worse, Jalen's ankle worked
This guy came to work with a Philly Championship tee cause he pre-made the shirt
You damn near lose to every Patrick that ya know
So do us all a favor and take ya ass ma homes (Mahomes)
Bro you have the tiniest...set of nostrils
I can't tell if it's cool if it's lame
On one hand you stay duckin' diseases, on the other you do love cocaine
And I'm not judgin', it's just the way his face was designed
But if you're gonna share drugs, plan on takin' your time
Cause when everybody else is out breakin' out lines, he gotta snort his cocaine one grain at a time
He breathes in it sounds like a long range missile
We breathes out it sounds like a fuckin' train whistle
They tried to rape this dude it would've been a terrible day
He just exhaled hard and it scared 'em away
Fuckin' square ass head brother, who are you?
The offspring of Lucy Liu and Rubik's Cube?
Who is your uncle Ahk?
A fuckin' Funko Pop?
My boy's a Lego best believe he runs a couple blocks
And I'm not even hatin' bro I like that
Lookin' like a fine ass character from Minecraft
But it's gettin' hard to tell what kind of accent he's flexin'
You got a weird twang like a Cantonese Texan
I'll leave you cryin' in H Mart like Japanese breakfast
I got the smoke like fajitas in ya Applebees section
I'll split his dumpling once that .50 peel
BAOW! You just got yourself a Disney deal
My bro's mad? I'm poppin' up in his bitch, be real
She throw it back like a homer at Wrigley Field
I'll give her 15 bucks and she'll lick these nuts
Your girl is a ho by name and your mom's Kim She (Kimchi) Sucks
Dumb must be dump if he's thinkin' he's at the top
You might think he's fish scale, from how I see it it has to stop
You might think that he's raw, from how I see it that shit's chop
You might see Dumb' as a brick, I see Dumb' as a bag of rocks
And doom is imminent bitch, you can see the shark tail
You try to drag race me, I'll put your Civic through a guardrail
Dumb's dumb as a hammer, you would buy at a yard sale
I'll put this battle in a coffin and use Dumb' as a doornail
But wait, wait, wait
He said his ten year goal was to start in an action movie
That's a doozie
You're 5'6"" and a half with boobies

Senja di desa Baron
Matahari tenggelam di dalam kemaron
Lembu betina lari melompat-lompat
Dikejar-kejar anaknya yang kecil meloncat
Senja lucu dengan kasih sayang ibu dan anak
Langit senja mengandung sapi beranak
Terpesona Ranto melihat
Ia tertawa bergelak
Dan berubah jadi Ranto Gudel
Sang pelawak Dadi Marmoyo

Di panggung ketoprak
Ranto Gudеl meminum arak
Terendam di dalam ciu
Birahinya bеrubah jadi biru
Diajaknya Nyai Dasima bercinta
Dengan cinta sepahit topi miringnya
Layar dibuka turun hujan gembukan
Dewi Mlenuk jembuk datang
Membawa seguling roti cakwe
Marmoyo rebah terguling tidur
Di pangkuan Nyai Dasima
Yang sekeras ciu cangkol buah dadanya
Ke mana Ranto Gudel pergi
Panggung selalu harum dengan arak yang wangi

Tiba di pinggir kali

Dhemit elek a'u tenan
Ngumpat Ranto Gudel geram

Malam beranjak bangun minum berminum

Lapen ciu cangkol arak bekonang dituang

Dusk in the village of Baron
The sun sets in the evening
The female calf runs jumping up and down
Chased by his little son jumped
Cute twilight with mother and child affection
The evening sky contains calving cows
Ranto was fascinated to see
He laughed giddily
And turned into Ranto Gudel
The comedian Dadi Marmoyo

On the ketoprak stage
Ranto Gudel drank wine
Submerged in kisses
His lust turned blue
He asked Nyai Dasima to make love
With love as bitter as his cocked hat
The screen opened as it rained heavily
Dewi Mlenuk jembuk came
Bring a roll of cakwe bread
Marmoyo fell asleep
On Nyai Dasima's lap
Which is as hard as kissing her boobs
Where did Ranto Gudel go?
The stage is always fragrant with fragrant wine

Gendruwo thela-thelo looked sluggish

Pak Mloyo rolled over to Bengawan Solo
With the rhythm of the strains of nong ji nong ro
Mr. Mloyo came home with a wandering walk

Eh, the lineup is shaking

Ranto Gudel drank bekonang wine
Take the girl home dressed as a midwife
The skirt is white, the shirt is white
All white more than fairies
Arrived at the edge of the river
Ranto Gudel was invited to turn left
Dhemit elek a'u really
Swearing Ranto Gudel was furious

He was angry to be submerged in bekonang wine
I almost fell in love with the devil
Human love is like Umbul Beking
It used to be clear, now it's cloudy
Ranto Gudel with his four wives
Never lasting love

It's nice to be wedhus than human
When dead buried in the mound of earth
His head urinated wedhus grazing
Human fate is just miserable
Oh why should we bother
Try to live like Ki Joko Lelur
Daydreaming drinking lemonade
Night went up to drink drink

Lapen ciu cengkol bekonang wine is poured
He installed crank bottles in every corner of the house
What's the use of being afraid of mice, apparently
Oh reminiscing the shadows in his old age
Ciu hoe is just a spirit to drive away rats
Even though I used to drink it until I was dead

Okay, look at the fight
As usual, collected dues
Ordinary, seeing harassment
Normal, uniformed
Ordinary, see procurement
Ordinary, dreams are broken
Normal, in comparison
As usual, shown

Ruled by unreasonable rules
Forced to get messy

Ordinary, dashing
As usual, squash
Normal, speeding
Ordinary, expensive

No wonder I became a demon
Usually rotated as proof
No wonder I'm so shy
Rebuke condescending speech
Asked for awards
If you have a dick, you have to make it big
Educate 'to chase deposits
Get used to seeing wrong things as inheritance

Saat ku sendiri, kulihat foto dan video
Bersamamu yang telah lama kusimpan
Hancur hati ini melihat semua gambar diri
Yang tak bisa, kuulang kembali

Kuingin saat ini, engkau ada di sini
Tertawa bersamaku, seperti dulu lagi
Walau hanya sebentar, Tuhan tolong kabulkanlah
Bukannya diri ini tak terima kenyataan
Hati ini hanya rindu

Segala cara telah kucoba

When I'm alone, I look at photos and videos
With you that I have kept for a long time
It breaks my heart to see all the pictures of myself
Those who can't, I repeat

I want this moment, you are here
Laugh with me, like old times
Even if only for a moment, God please grant it
It's not that you don't accept reality
This heart just misses

I have tried every way
So that I can be without you
But all, different
It's hard for me to erase memories with you

I want this moment, you are here
Laugh with me, like old times
Even if only for a moment, God please grant it
It's not that you don't accept reality

Coba tanya hatimu sekali lagi
Sebelum engkau benar-benar pergi
Masihkah ada aku di dalamnya?
Karena hatiku masih menyimpanmu
Kisah kita memang baru sebentar
Namun kesan terukir sangat indah
Ku memang bukan manusia sempurna
Tapi tak pernah berhenti mencoba

Membuatmu tersenyum, walau tak pernah berbalas
Bahagiamu juga bahagiaku

Saat kau terlalu rapuh
Pundak siapa yang tersandar?
Tangan siapa yang tak melepas?
Kuyakin aku
Bahkan saat kau memilih
Untuk meninggalkan aku
Tak pernah lelah menanti
Karena ku yakin kau akan kembali

Ada engkau dalam setiap doaku
Sungguh aku rindu berbagi tawa

Biarlah hanya dari kejauhan

Try asking your heart one more time

Am I still in it?
Because my heart still holds you
Our story is just short
But the engraved impression is very beautiful
I'm not a perfect human
But never stop trying

Makes you smile, even if you don't reply
Your happiness is also my happiness

When you're too fragile
Whose shoulder to lean on?
Whose hand does not let go?
I'm sure
Even when you choose
To leave me
Never tired of waiting
Because I'm sure you'll come back

There are you in my every prayer

Won't call me by name, only ""baby""
The more that you give, the less that I need
Everyone says I look happy
When it feels right

I know that you're wrong for me
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
I brought you down to your knees
'Cause they say that misery loves company
It's not your fault I ruin everything
And it's not your fault I can't be what you need
Baby, angels like you can't fly down here with me

I'm everything they said I would be
La, la, la
I'm everything they said I would be

I'll put you down slow, love you goodbye
Before you let go, just one more time
Take off your clothes, pretend that it's fine
A little more hurt won't kill you
Tonight, mother says you don't look happy
Close your eyes

Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer till our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer till our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me, well, that's okay, baby
Only words bleed inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home

Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Oh, you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were 16
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me, well, that's okay, baby
Only words bleed inside these pages
You just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on 6th Street
Hearing you whisper through the phone

Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two

She thinks it's special, but it's all reused

I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you

There is bitter in everyday
But then I feel it
That you would be the only one
Sometimes it doesn't have to be so sure
The sweetest love can be so hard to find
We'll be better in every way
But then I would go to be in other space
Sometimes, the bitter of love can be so good
It's like a coffee with a rainbow's mood

Sometimes you feel off but sometimes you feeling right
Is it to be, or it is not to be
To fall in love again, to be the one for me
Sometimes you fall, but there'll be time we'd be together

Then I remember, the store we went last september
Sometimes, recalling things would be so good
It's like perfect cake, that my grandma's made

Sometimes you feel off but sometimes you feeling right
Is it to be, or it is not to be
To fall in love again, to be the one for me
Sometimes you fall, but there'll be the time we'd be with together

I didn't realize you had put your heart on it
To me who has always been your friend
At first I didn't want to open the door of my heart
Unintentionally my heart has opened again

I was wrong to ignore you
Until you tire yourself
And choose 'to go

Now I know (now I know) how much I love you
I'm so lost without you
When you're not by my side
Now I know (now I know) how much I love you
And now I know how much I need you
Now I realize

Too late I understand the meaning of you love
Not just a day filler, you are different
Even when I was not aware of your love
I can't be too far from you

I got a heart and I got a soul
Believe me, I will use them both
We made a start, be it a false one, I know
Baby, I don't want to feel alone

So kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground

I have loved you since we were eighteen (Eighteen, eighteen)
Long before we both thought the same thing (Same thing, same—)
To be loved and to be in love
All I can do is say that these arms were made for holdin' you, oh
I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were eighteen

We took a chance, God knows we've tried
Yet all along, I knew we'd be fine
So pour me a drink, oh, love
And let's split the night wide open
And we'll see everything we can

Actually I want to be near you
But I realized I couldn't
I can't be here
My danger is getting love
I don't want to be far
Don't want to separate
Why is everything always beautiful
When with you
It's a shame to end
If only you could understand
How heavy I am
I must keep smiling
Though my heart hurt
What is the meaning of this love
If I'm not with you
If so I have to go
I'm sure my heart is you
Isn't it the universe that brought us together
Should I tell the stars

And why did I fall in love

Lily was a little girl
Afraid of the big, wide world
She grew up within her castle walls
Now and then, she tried to run
And then on a night with the settin' sun
She went in the woods away
So afraid, all alone

They've warned her, don't go there
There's creatures who are hidin' in the dark
Then somethin' came creepin'
It told her, ""Don't you worry, just

Follow everywhere I go
Top of all the mountains or valley low
Give you everything you've been dreamin' of
Just let me in, ooh
Everything you want in gold
I'll be the magic story you've been told
And you'll be safe under my control
Just let me in, ooh""

Just let me in, ooh

She knew she was hypnotized
And walking on cold, thin ice
Then it broke and she awoke again

Then she ran faster and
Start screamin', ""Is there someone out there?
Please help me, come get me""
Behind her, she can hear it say

""Follow everywhere I go
Top of all the mountains or valley low
Give you everything you've been dreamin' of

Sudahi malam yang duka
Dunia kau kan baik saja
Hujan akan tiba melahirkan pelangi

When I'm away from you

Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true

Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable

But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did

Didn't you hear Amanda's movin' back to Colorado?
It's 2013 and the end of my life
Freshman year's about to plummet just a little harder
But it didn't 'cause we kissed on that Halloween night

I bleached half my hair when I saw Zoe on your Vespa
It was orange from three-percent peroxide, thanks to you
I needed a good cry, I headed right to Kendra's
I hated you and I hoped to God that you knew

Now there's drama (Drama), found a club for that
Where I met ya (Met ya), had a heart attack
Yadda, yadda
At the end, yeah, we burned
Made a couplе U-turns
You were it 'til you werеn't (Mm)

High school in Jakarta, sorta modern Sparta
Had no chance against the teenage suburban armadas
We were a sonata, thanks to tight-lipped fathers
Yeah, livin' under that was hard, but I loved you harder
High school in Jakarta, an elaborate saga
I still hate you for makin' me wish I came out smarter
You love-hate your mother, so do I
Could've ended different, then again
We went to high school in Jakarta

Got a group assignment, I'll be at Vall's place
You don't text at all and only call when you're off your face
I'm petty and say, ""Call me when you're not unstable""
I lie and tell you I'll be gettin' drunk at Rachel's

I wasn't, she doesn't even drink
But I couldn't have you sit there and think
That you're better 'cause you're older
Are you better now that we're older?

High school in Jakarta, sorta modern Sparta
Had no chance against the teenage suburban armadas
We were a sonata, thanks to tight-lipped fathers

We're movin' in in March or so
And although you bring me to tears
I'm glad that we gave it a go
High school in Jakarta, American summer
Had no chance against the Marxist girl with marijuana
I was your piñata, she was a star-charter
Glad she gave it to you real hard, but I loved you harder

It's 4 AM
I can't turn my head off
Wishing these memories would fade, they never do
Turns out people lie
They said, ""Just snap your fingers""
As if it was really that easy for me to get over you

I just need time

Snappin' one, two
Where are you?
You're still in my heart
Snappin' three, four
Don't need you here anymore
Get out of my heart
'Cause I might snap

I'm writin' a song
Said, ""This is the last one""
How many last songs are left? I'm losing count
Since June 22nd
My heart's been on fire
I've been spendin' my nights in the rain tryin' to put it out

Where are you?
You're still in my heart
Snappin' three, four
Don't need you here anymore
Get out of my heart
'Cause I might snap

Oh-woah
'Cause I might snap
Oh-woah

And if one more person says, ""You should get over it""
Oh, I might stop talkin' to people before I snap, snap, snap
Oh, I might stop talkin' to people before I snap

Snappin' one, two
Where are you? (Where are you?)
You're still in my heart (Still in my heart)

Don't need you here anymore (Need you here anymore)

There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered, ""Have we met?""
Across the room, your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

I wonder 'til I'm wide awake

Kick in the door, waving the coco
팝콘 이나 챙겨 껴들 생각 말고
I talk that talk, runways I walk, walk
눈 감고 pop, pop 안 봐도 척
One by one, then two by two
내 손끝 툭 하나에 다 무너지는 중
가짜 쇼 치곤 화려했지
Makes no sense, you couldn't get a dollar outta me

자 오늘 밤이야
난 독을 품은 꽃
네 혼을 빼앗은 다음
Look what you made us do
천천히 널 잠재울 fire (Fire)
잔인할 만큼 아름다워

Kick in the door, waving the coco
Don't even think about grabbing some popcorn

Close your eyes, pop, pop, pretend not to see
One by one, then two by two
It's all crumbling at the touch of my fingertips
It was gorgeous for a fake show
Makes no sense, you couldn't get a dollar outta me

well it's tonight
I am a poisonous flower
after taking your soul
Look what you made us do

It was just two lovers
Sittin' in the car, listening to Blonde, fallin' for each other
Pink and orange skies, feelin' super childish, no Donald Glover
Missed call from my mother
Like, ""Where you at tonight?""
Got no alibi

I was all alone with the love of my life
She's got glitter for skin
My radiant beam in the night
I don't need no light to see you

Shine
It's your golden hour (Oh-oh-oh)
You slow down time
In your golden hour (Oh-oh-oh)

We were just two lovers
Feet up on the dash, drivin' nowhere fast, burnin' through the summer
Radio on blast, make the moment last, she got solar power
Minutes feel like hours
She knew she was the baddest
Can you even imagine fallin' like I did?

Praying for my downfall, many have tried, baby
Catch me when you hear my Lamborghini go vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom

When we pull up, you know it's a shutdown
Lower the sign and lock the door, shut down
Whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it
Whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it
It's black and it's pink once the sun down
When we pull up, you know it's a shutdown
Lower the sign and lock the door, shut down
Whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it
Whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it
Keep watchin' me shut it down

Nah, you don't wanna be on my bad side
That's right, I'm slidin' through
Bunch of wannabes that wanna be me
Me three, if I was you
Been around the world, pearls on ya girl

Need a lesson, see the necklace, see these dresses
We don't buy it, we request it, uh
A rock star, a pop star, but a rowdier
Say byе to the paparazzi, get my good side, I'll smile for ya
Know it ain't fair to ya, it's scarin' ya like what now?
BLACKPINK in your area, the area been shut down
It's a shutdown

It's your next answer sheet, look straight at it, don't sleep, baby
Turn it over, this is a price tag, ain't cheap, baby
Stay in your own lane 'cause I'm 'bout to swerve
Catch me when you hear my Lamborghini go vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom

When we pull up, you know it's a shutdown

Thursday, July 16, 2020
Running against the clock, but the clock hated me on 10 pm 20
Intricate day, let me say I was a little busy
Apply my family orders like a pizza man delivery
Jogging l3am kaml even I’m fat, like a machine gun
But 365 never shares or d-d-divided with me
History save!, before I get taped
I don’t wanna drop the key, I wanna be at the end a fairy tail
It’s time to spit what I’m felling on the paper
Shocking content get some sugar or bring some pepper
It took me days to write this with my flavor
I ain't got no wheels, I’m a true pro player like a faker
While I remember the girl that dated she was bhal Tayka
Evil with the makeup, then we break up
Zero percent chances like a naked, the truth rises the silence
The silence kills, Start the funeral, Bury me, invite the undertaker
I’m telling you Whenever, wherever whichever
Whoever I’m already dead inside, however
I just wanna recall the day that I stepped outside
Waddling like duck perhaps at the mid of night
Catching up a taxi Hello sir where you want to go
Please put me in avenue look at me
I called that, I struggle with that cuz I'm lonely
How this verse could be good enough if got somebody

Should I wait, Should I wait another day, another day
Should I wait another day

Yeah, chilling on my room, eyes up on the roof
Listening to deathbed Powfu
Thinking on a clue for my puzzle to make proof
Life moves leisurely in such a sort of crossword clues
I don’t know why, why this make changes on me
Such randomly, occasionally through my moods
I guess that I’m not the only one with the same groove
Stir the water, the thirsty might show up with the same view
Take or leave it until another day
In any way, you’ll get that we’re all in the same crew
Maybe we’ll make Rendez-Vous in the heaven
For the remission of our sins just say Lahi3fu Or probably Hallelu
Well this, started already get me confused
I really don’t know who I am
I just wanna know who I am
Probably everybody wanna know who I am

Ooh, ooh, hey, yeah
Hmm, yeah, psycho

널 어쩌면 좋을까
이런 맘은 또 첨이라
Up and down이 좀 심해
조절이 자꾸 잘 안돼
하나 확실한 건
I don’t play the game

우리 진짜 별나대
그냥 내가 너무 좋아해
넌 그걸 너무 잘 알고
날 쥐락펴락해
나도 마찬가지인걸 (Oh-oh-oh)

우린 참 별나고 이상한 사이야
서로를 부서지게 (부서지게)
그리곤 또 껴안아 (그리곤 또 껴안아)

서로 좋아 죽는 바보 바보 (바보, 바보)
너 없인 어지럽고 슬퍼져
기운도 막 없어요

Hey, now we’ll be okay

Hey, trouble
경고 따윈 없이 오는 너
I’m original, visual
우린 원래 이랬어, yeah
두렵지는 않아 (흥미로울 뿐)
It’s hot! Let me just hop
어떻게 널 다룰까? Ooh, ooh, ooh

어쩔 줄을 몰라 너를 달래고
매섭게 발로 차도
가끔 내게 미소 짓는 널
어떻게 놓겠어? Ooh, ooh
우린 아름답고 참 슬픈 사이야
서로를 빛나게 해 (Tell me now)
마치 달과 강처럼 (그리곤 또 껴안아, yeah)

maybe i like you
It's the first time I've felt like this
Up and down is a bit severe
Adjustment is not good
One thing is certain
I don't play the game

They say we’re really weird

Oh no, did I get too close?
Oh, did I almost see what's really on the inside?
All your insecurities
All the dirty laundry
Never made me blink one time

Unconditional, unconditionally
I will love you unconditionally
There is no fear now
Let go and just be free
I will love you unconditionally

So come just as you are to me
Don't need apologies
Know that you are worthy
I'll take your bad days with your good
Walk through the storm, I would
I'd do it all because I love you
I love you

Unconditional, unconditionally
I will love you unconditionally
There is no fear now
Let go and just be free
I will love you unconditionally

So open up your heart and just let it begin

And there is no fear now
Let go and just be free

I will never know if you love me
Or my company, but I don't mind
'Cause I ain't tryna be the one
Been through this a thousand times
I don't need to take your heart
You keep yours, I'll keep mine
All I really know is when I'm lonely
I hate that I'm lonely
And that's why I let you in
And maybe in another life
We fight all day, kiss all night
But I don't wanna break your heart
You keep yours, I'll keep mine

I know
We know better, so
We'd both better go

I don't need a reason
To keep on dreamin'
That we don't lose, yeah, what's the use?
I don't need a reason
To keep on dreamin', oh
That we can win at anything at all

Am I the only one who sees right through this?
Yeah, all this bullshit, don't play me for no fool
Yeah, you don't gotta lose your mind
Every time I don't call
And I should never have to win your love
Then hate myself when I don't, oh
Fickle as you are, that's exactly why I keep on runnin' back
'Cause I'm brittle at the parts where I wish I were strong
And maybe when you need my help
I like myself when it's over
But later in the light you go dark and rogue
And I need closure

And I know
Whatever this is ain't love
So I'm goin'
I'm gonna let you go, let you go

I don't need a reason
To keep on dreamin'
That we don't lose, yeah, what's the use?

To keep on dreamin'

I know
We know better, so
We'd both better go

I don't need a reason

Mmm

Am I the only one who sees right through this?
Yeah, all this bullshit, don't play me for no fool
Yeah, you don't gotta lose your mind
Every time I don't call
And I should never have to win your love
Then hate myself when I don't, oh
Fickle as you are, that's exactly why I keep on runnin' back
'Cause I'm brittle at the parts where I wish I were strong
And maybe when you need my help
I like myself when it's over
But later in the light you go dark and rogue
And I need closure

And I know
Whatever this is ain't love
So I'm goin'
I'm gonna let you go, let you go

I don't need a reason
To keep on dreamin'

Sanggupkah kau dan aku memulai kembali
Merangkai hati yang hancur berkeping-keping
Sanggupkah kau berjanji 'tuk tetap disini

Maaf bila sempat kau kecewa kepadaku

Dahulu terasa indah
Tak ingin lupakan
Bermesraan selalu jadi
Satu kenangan manis

Tiada yang salah
Hanya aku manusia bodoh
Yang biarkan semua ini permainkanku
Berulang ulang kali

Mencoba bertahan sekuat hati
Layaknya karang yang dihempas sang ombak
Jalani hidup dalam buai belaka
Serahkan cinta tulus di dalam takdir

Tak ayal tingkah lakumu
Buatku putus asa
Kadang akal sehat ini
Tak cukup membendungnya

Hanya kepedihan
Yang selalu datang menertawakanku
Engkau belahan jiwa
Tega menari indah di atas tangisanku

It used to be beautiful
Don't want to forget
Always making out
One sweet memory

Nothing wrong
I'm just a stupid human
Who let all this play me
Over and over again

Trying to hold on as hard as I can
Like a rock crushed by the waves
Live life in a mere cradle
Leave sincere love in destiny

No doubt your behavior
Make me desperate
Sometimes this common sense
Not enough to contain it

Only pain
Who always come laugh at me
You're soul mate
Hearts dance beautifully on top of my tears

So is the end of this story

Go ahead and park after dark
Fallen star, I'm your one call away
Motel halls, neon walls
When night falls, I am your escape

When you lay alone, I ache
Something I wanted to feel

If you’ve been waitin' for fallin' in love
Babe, you don’t have to wait on me
'Cause I've been aimin' for Heaven above
But an angel ain't what I need

Not anyone, you're the one
More than fun, you're the sanctuary
'Cause what you want is what I want
Sincerity

Souls that dream alone lie awake
I’ll give you somethin’ so real

Hold me oh so close

Just how long our lives will be

Hidupku tanpa cintamu
Bagai malam tanpa bintang
Cintaku tanpa sambutmu
Bagai panas tanpa hujan
Jiwaku berbisik lirih
Ku harus milikimu

Aku bisa membuatmu jatuh cinta kepadaku
Meski kau tak cinta kepadaku
Beri sedikit waktu
Biar cinta datang karena telah terbiasa

Simpan mawar yang kuberi
Mungkin wanginya mengilhami
Sudikah dirimu untuk
Kenali aku dulu
Sebelum kau ludahi aku
Sebelum kau robek hatiku

Aku bisa membuatmu (Jatuh cinta kepadaku)
(Meski kau tak cinta) kepadaku
Beri sedikit waktu
Biar cinta datang karena telah terbiasa

My life without your love
Like a night without stars
My love without your welcome
It's hot without rain
My soul whispers softly
I must have you

I can make you fall in love with me
Even though you don't love me
Give it a little time
Let love come because you are used to it

Save the rose I gave you
Perhaps the fragrance inspires
Are you willing to
Get to know me first
Before you spit on me
Before you tore my heart

I'm packin' my bags that I didn't unpack the last time
I'm sayin', ""see you again"" so many times it's becomin' my tag line
But you know the truth, I'd rather hold you
Than try to catch this flight
So many things I'd rather say
But for now, it's ""goodbye""

You say I'm always leavin'
You, when you're sleepin' alone
But the car's outside
But I don't wanna go tonight

I'm not gettin' in the Addison Lee
Unless you pack your bags
You're comin' with me
I'm tired of lovin' from afar
And never being where you are
Close the windows, lock the doors
Don't wanna leave you anymore

I'm starin' at the same four walls in a different hotel
It's an unfamiliar feelin', but I know it so well
Oh, but you know the truth, I'd rather hold you
Than this mobile in my hand
But I guess it'll do
'Cause for you, I would run up my phone bill

You must think that I'm stupid
You must think that I'm a fool
You must think that I'm new to this

I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true

Aku tak mengerti apa yang kurasa
Rindu yang tak pernah begitu hebatnya
Aku mencintaimu lebih dari yang kau tahu
Meski kau tak 'kan pernah tahu
Aku persembahkan hidupku untukmu
Telah kurelakan hatiku padamu
Namun kau masih bisu
Diam seribu bahasa
Dan hati kecilku bicara

Baru kusadari
Cintaku bertepuk sebelah tangan
Kau buat remuk seluruh hatiku
Seluruh hatiku

Semoga waktu akan mengilhami
Sisi hatimu yang beku
Semoga akan datang keajaiban
Hingga akhirnya kau pun mau
Aku mencintaimu

Hopefully a miracle will come
