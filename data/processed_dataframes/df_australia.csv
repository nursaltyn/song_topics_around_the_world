(Last night, all I think about is you)
(Don't stop, baby, you can walk through)
(Don't want, baby, think about you)
(You know that I'm never gonna lose)
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a—

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Usually, I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today, I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I say goodbye

Can't make you happier now

I just wonder what you're dreamin' of

I just wish that I could give you that

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around

For now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I met you in the dark, you lit me up
You made me feel as though I was enough
We danced the night away, we drank too much
I held your hair back when you were throwin' up

Then, you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, ""I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest""
I knew I loved you then, but you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you, but I never showed
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school, wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, woah
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that every day, you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you and I hope you know

I look up from the ground
To see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me
And I see there's something you're trying to hide
And I reach for your hand but it's cold
You pull away again
And I wonder what's on your mind
And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble and your voice begins to break
You say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's
They were my mate's
And I feel the colour draining from my face
And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be alright""

So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent
And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head
And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone
And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on
But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
But I just wanna stay

And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be okay
It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
So bottoms up, let's forget tonight
You'll find another and you'll be just fine
Let her go""

They were my mate's
And I feel the colour draining from my face
And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be alright""

So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent
And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head
And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone
And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on
But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
But I just wanna stay

And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be okay
It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
So bottoms up, let's forget tonight
You'll find another and you'll be just fine
Let her go""

So I guess I gotta stay now

Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear
Isn't it lovely, all alone?
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home

Walking out of time
Looking for a better place (Looking for a better place)

Tell me somethin', girl
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?

I'm fallin'
In all the good times
I find myself longing for change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself
Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryna fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?

I'm falling
In all the good times
I find myself longing for change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay

Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)

I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak

You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (Can't take back the love that I gave you)

Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much
And that's an issue, but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends
It was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no calls
Now you're lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop
So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover

Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older

You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that blink-182 song

(Mmm)

Now, here you go again, you say you want your freedom
Well, who am I to keep you down?
It's only right that you should play the way you feel it
But listen carefully to the sound of your loneliness

Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of rememberin'
What you had and what you lost
And what you had and what you lost
Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say, women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
You'll know

Now, here I go again, I see the crystal visions
I keep my visions to myself
It's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams
And have you any dreams you'd like to sell?

Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars

If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time

You want me, I want you, baby

I know you so well, so well
I mean, I can do anything that he can
I've been pretty—

I know you're somewhere, somewhere
I've been trapped in my mind, girl, just holding on
I don't wanna pretend we're something, we're nothing
I've been stuck thinking 'bout her, I can't hold on (I'll be feeling)
I'm in pain, wanna put ten shots in my brain
I've been trippin' 'bout some things, can't change
Suicidal, same time I'm tame
Picture this, in bed, get a phone call
Girl that you fucked with killed herself
That was this summer when nobody helped
And ever since then, man, I hate myself
Wanna fuckin' end it, pessimistic
All wanna see me with no pot to piss in
But niggas been excited 'bout the grave I'm diggin'
Havin' conversations 'bout my haste decisions
Fuckin' sickenin'; at the same time
Memories surface through the grapevine
'Bout my uncle playin' with a slip knot
Post-traumatic stress got me fucked up
Been fucked up since the couple months they had a nigga locked up

I'll be feelin' pain, I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb
I'll be feelin' pain, I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb
I know you so well (I know you, girl)

(One, two, three, four)
Ooh, ooh

Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's truе, it's true
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lеad to you

Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

We took the long way 'round
And burned 'til the fun ran out, now

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do

I walk in the corner with the money, on my finger

Fuck with a nigga raw, this who you wanna be
And I know you won't tell nobody nothing
And I know you won't tell nobody no

I might tell her girl you cute but balling

Well, time can heal, but this won't
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'da known you had a storm to weather
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So before you go

Was never the right time whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all

But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face

Crying 'cause you weren't around

And you're probably with that blonde girl

She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?
And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you

And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one, oh
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

There's never much love when we go OT

Sexy Babe namens Anna auf den Cayman Islands
Ich bin auf dem Weg nach Havanna, willst du eh mit auf Segelreise
Komm, wir cruisen durch den Panama-Kanal
Und essen Ananas mit Sahne, ich spritz Anna nass mit Sahne
Ich hab die Bitch in Paris auf dem Eiffelturm gebangt
Du bist eifersüchtig, denn du hast leider keine Fans
Du hast keine kleinen Groupies, die dir Liebesbriefe schreiben
Und dich bitten: ""Kannst du mal auf dem Bikini unterschreiben""
Und ich sagte zu der Bitch ohne Waffengelaber
„Wenn du mit mir bist, kaufe ich dir ständig Sachen von Prada“
Und wenn ich sage, dass du jetzt von mir 'ne Latte kriegst
Red' ich nicht von braunen Getränken oder von Zaunelementen
Sie hat den Dick in St. Tropez gelutscht
Bei Kentucky Fried Chicken in L.A. gelutscht
Mitten in der Neighbourhood
Ich fick mit Bitches auf Jamaika in 'ner Schilfhütte
Zwei schwarze Babes und ich Homie - Milchschnitte


Mein Haus ist groß wie die Bayern-Arena
Und mein Anzug ist ein Joop, wie von Bayern der Trainer
Und ich scheiße auf Boulevard-Magazine
Ich guck Taff nur, weil ich das geile Fräulein Warnkross so liebe
Und ja ich geb' es zu, ich hatte Sex mit Annemarie Warnkross
Und die Brötchen in der Früh ja sie warn kross
Get it? Sie hat gefickt mit 'nem Rapper
Und am nächsten Tag da nahm sie mir was mit von 'nem Bäcker
Und im Radio läuft DJ Antoine
Wir sind wieder mal in Cannes in diesem Kino da am Strand
Ich kauf' mir Sakkos aus Samt und riech nach Paco Rabanne
Bestell' Macchiatos in Cannes und ess' 'nen Taco am Strand
Und wer mich hatet hatet eigentlich sich selbst
Oder schöne Dinge, so wie geile Weiber oder Geld
Sowie Kleider von Chanel, Kaschmir, Seide oder Pelz

And eat pineapple with cream, I splash Anna wet with cream
I banged that bitch in Paris on the Eiffel Tower
You're jealous because unfortunately you don't have any fans
You don't have little groupies writing you love letters
And ask you: ""Could you sign the bikini?""
And I said no gun talk to the bitch
""When you're with me, I'll buy you Prada stuff all the time""
And if I say I'll give you a latte now
I don't talk about brown drinks or fence elements
She sucked the dick in St Tropez
Sucked at Kentucky Fried Chicken in L.A
In the middle of the neighborhood
I fuck with bitches in Jamaica in a reed hut
Two black babes and me homie - milk cut


My house is as big as the Bayern Arena
And my suit is a Joop, like the coach from Bayern
And I don't give a fuck about tabloids
I only watch Taff because I love horny Miss Warnkross so much
And yes, I'll admit it, I had sex with Annemarie Warnkross
And the rolls in the morning, yes, they were crispy
Get it? She fucked with a rapper
And the next day she took me something from a baker
And DJ Antoine is playing on the radio
We are again in Cannes in this cinema on the beach
I buy velvet jackets and smell like Paco Rabanne
Order macchiatos in Cannes and eat a taco on the beach
And whoever hates me actually hates himself
Or beautiful things, like horny women or money
As well as dresses from Chanel, cashmere, silk or fur
I cock haters away and take a trip around the world

We hug and, yes, we make love
And always just say goodnight (La-la-la-la-la-la)
And we cuddle, sure, I do love it
But I need your lips on mine

Can you kiss me more?
We're so young, boy, we ain't got nothin' to lose, oh-oh
It's just principle
Baby, hold me 'cause I like the way you groove, oh-oh
Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Oh, I love the taste, la-la-la-la-la-la
All on my tongue, I want it (La-la-la-la-la-la)
Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Oh, I love the taste, la-la-la-la-la-la
All on my tongue, I want it (La-la-la-la-la-la)

I, I feel like fuckin' somethin'
But we could be corny, fuck it
Sugar, I ain't no dummy, dummy
I likе to say, ""What if?"" But if
We could kiss and just cut the rubbish
Then I might bе onto somethin'
I ain't givin' you one in public
I'm givin' you hundreds, fuck it
Somethin' we just gotta get into
Sign first, middle, last on the wisdom tooth
Niggas wishin' that the pussy was a kissin' booth
Taste breakfast, lunch, and gin and juice
And that dinner just like dessert too
And when we French, refresh, give me two
When I bite that lip, come get me too
He want lipstick, lip gloss, hickeys too, huh

You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head

I'm tryna put you in the worst mood, ah
P1 cleaner than your church shoes, ah
Milli point two just to hurt you, ah
All red Lamb' just to tease you, ah
None of these toys on lease too, ah
Made your whole year in a week too, yah
Main bitch outta your league too, ah
Side bitch outta your league too, ah
House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table, cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby, ah
You talkin' money, need a hearin' aid
You talkin' 'bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain

(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)

Look what you've done
(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy

Every day, a nigga try to test me, ah
Every day, a nigga try to end me, ah
Pull off in that Roadster SV, ah
Pockets overweight, gettin' hefty, ah
Comin' for the king, that's a far cry, I
I come alive in the fall time, I
The competition, I don't really listen
I'm in the blue Mulsanne, bumpin' New Edition

Girls get loose when they hear this song
A hundred on the dash get me close to God
We don't pray for love, we just pray for cars

First things first: rest in peace, Uncle Phil
For real
You the only father that I ever knew
I get my bitch pregnant, I'ma be a better you
Prophecies that I made way back in the Ville
Fulfilled
Listen, even back when we was broke, my team ill
Martin Luther King woulda been on Dreamville, talk to a nigga

One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. ho
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

No role models, and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one
Last night, I was gettin' my feet rubbed by the baddest bitch
Not Trina, but I swear to God, this bitch'll make you call your girl up
And tell her, ""Hey, what's good?
Sorry, I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good""
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said, ""Nah, I was the same without it""
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
'Fore I started callin' bitches ""bitches"" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody, you wadn't sweatin' me

One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. ho
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

I want a real love, dark-skinned Aunt Viv love
That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga, I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out-of-touch-with-reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin' back five or six hoes
Fuck 'em then we kick 'em to the do', nigga, you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back?
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt, 'fore she leave
""I'ma need my shirt back"" (Nigga, you know how it go)

One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. ho
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
There's an old saying in Tennessee—I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee—that says, fool me once... shame on... shame on you
Fool me—can't get fooled again

Fool me one time, shame on you (Ayy)
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you (Ayy)
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you (Bop, bop, bop)
Fool me one time, shame on you (Ayy)
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you (Ayy)
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you (Bop, bop, bop)

My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script, the bitch prolly couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret, could never take Aaliyah home
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face 'cause they know it's they song

She shallow but the pussy deep (She shallow
She shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (She shallow), yeah, ayy
(She shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (She shallow), haha
(She shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (She shallow

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

Home grown alligator, see you later
Gotta hit the road, gotta hit the road
Something changed in the atmosphere
Architecture unfamiliar
I could get used to this

Time flies by in the yellow and green
Stick around and you'll see what I mean
There's a mountain-top that I'm dreamin' of
If you need me you know where I'll be
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone

South of the Equator, navigator
Gotta hit the road, gotta hit the road
Deep sea divin' 'round the clock
Bikini bottoms, lager tops
I could get used to this

Time flies by in the yellow and green
Stick around and you'll see what I mean
There's a mountain-top that I'm dreamin' of
If you need me you know where I'll be

I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone

We got two in the front
Two in the back
Sailin' along
And we don't look back (Back, back, back-back-back-back)

Home grown alligator, see you later
Gotta hit the road, gotta hit the road
Something changed in the atmosphere
Architecture unfamiliar
I could get used to this

Time flies by in the yellow and green
Stick around and you'll see what I mean
There's a mountain-top that I'm dreamin' of
If you need me you know where I'll be
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone

South of the Equator, navigator
Gotta hit the road, gotta hit the road
Deep sea divin' 'round the clock
Bikini bottoms, lager tops
I could get used to this

Time flies by in the yellow and green
Stick around and you'll see what I mean
There's a mountain-top that I'm dreamin' of
If you need me you know where I'll be

I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone

We got two in the front
Two in the back
Sailin' along
And we don't look back (Back, back, back-back-back-back)

Found you when your heart was broke
I filled your cup until it overflowed

I said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinkin' you could live without me

I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
Her moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
""Hurry, boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had (Ooh)
The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa

I'm sure you've heard it all before, but you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you, but I don't know how

You're gonna be the one that saves me

Under streetlights in the City of Palms
Call me what you want, when you want, if you want
And you can call me names if you call me up
Three nights at the motel
Under streetlights in the City of Palms
Call me what you want, when you want, if you want
And you can call me names if you call me up

Feel like the least of all your problems
You can reach me if you wanna stay up tonight, stay up at night
Green lights in your body language
Seems like you could use a little company from me
But if you got everything figured out like you say
Don't waste a minute, don't wait a minute
It's only a matter of time for you-ooh-ooh-ooh to-ooh-ooh-ooh
Tell me now, 'cause I've been up for, I've been up for
Three nights at the motel
Under streetlights in the City of Palms
Call me what you want, when you want, if you want (Want)
And you can call me names if you call me up (Call me up)
Three nights at the motel
Under streetlights in the City of Palms
Call me what you want, when you want, if you want
And you can call me names if you call me up (Ooh)

I can't fix each and all your problems
I'm no good with names and faces
She sent me naked pictures from her neck down to the waist
I get my feelings involved, she stopped returnin' my calls
Her flaws turned into walls and barricades
And I'm too far gone in all the wrong ways
And now every long day is a bad one
I can't make you call or make you stay or take you off the pedestal
So I get lost in modern music, watchin' movies, talkin' to the walls in my room
Walkin' through the halls in my head, just tryna make sure it all makes sense
I ain't made of money, maybe someday, you can take it from me?
I'm up too late thinkin' 'bout you in MIA for

Baby, lay on back and relax
Kick your pretty feet up on my dash
No need to go nowhere fast
Let's enjoy right here where we at
Who knows where this road is supposed to lead?
We got nothing, but time
As long as you're right here next to me
Everything's gonna be alright

If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, just let it be
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, just let it be
So won't you ride with me, ride with me?
See where this thing goes
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, if it's meant to be
I don't mean to be so uptight
But my heart's been hurt a couple times
By a couple guys that didn't treat me right
I ain't gon' lie, ain't gon' lie
'Cause I'm tired of the fake love
Show me what you're made of
Boy, make me believe
Whoa, hold up, girl, don't you know you're beautiful?
And it's easy to see

If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be

Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose

Ride it, ride, let me feel you
Ride it, turn the lights down low
Ride  it, from head to toe
Ride  it, ride it, touch my soul
Ride it, ride, let me feel you

It's  been a month and twenty days
And we're going 'round and 'round, playing silly games
Now you're saying, slow it down, not right now
Then ya wink at me and walk away
Let  it be, let it be, let it be known
Hold on, don't go
Touching and teasing me, telling me no
But this time I need to feel you
Ride it, we're all alone
Ride it, just lose control
Ride it, ride it, come touch my soul
Ride it, ride, let me feel you
Ride it, turn the lights down low

Ride it, ride it, touch my soul
Ride it, ride it, let me feel you

Movida was the club on the Saturday
Ya actin' like a diva, sayin' you don't wanna pay
It's gotta be ya feisty style, raised eyebrow
I love it when you look at me that way
Now we're in, you order a mojito at the bar
You re-apply lippy 'cause it came off on the glass
The DJ plays your favorite songs, Kanye's on
Now ya beckoning for me to dance
Mm, pullin' me, pullin' me, pullin' me close
Just close your eyes, girl
Whispering, tellin' me we gotta go
Won't you take me home? I want to ride it

Ride it, just lose control
Ride it, ride it, come touch my soul

Ride it, we're all alone
Ride  it, just lose control
Ride  it, ride it, come touch my soul
Ride it, ride, let me feel you
Ride it, turn the lights down low
Ride  it, from head to toe
Ride  it, ride it, touch my soul
Ride it, ride, let me feel you

It's  been a month and twenty days
And we're going 'round and 'round, playing silly games
Now you're saying, slow it down, not right now
Then ya wink at me and walk away
Let  it be, let it be, let it be known
Hold on, don't go
Touching and teasing me, telling me no
But this time I need to feel you
Ride it, we're all alone
Ride it, just lose control
Ride it, ride it, come touch my soul
Ride it, ride, let me feel you
Ride it, turn the lights down low
Ride it, from head to toe
Ride it, ride it, touch my soul
Ride it, ride it, let me feel you

Movida was the club on the Saturday
Ya actin' like a diva, sayin' you don't wanna pay
It's gotta be ya feisty style, raised eyebrow
I love it when you look at me that way
Now we're in, you order a mojito at the bar
You re-apply lippy 'cause it came off on the glass
The DJ plays your favorite songs, Kanye's on
Now ya beckoning for me to dance
Mm, pullin' me, pullin' me, pullin' me close
Just close your eyes, girl
Whispering, tellin' me we gotta go
Won't you take me home? I want to ride it

Ride it, we're all alone
Ride it, just lose control
Ride it, ride it, come touch my soul
Ride it, ride it, let me feel you
Ride it, turn the lights down low
Ride it, from head to toe

We are, we are, we are

L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
Sundown and they all come out
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers
The party's on, so they're headin' downtown ('Round here)
Everybody's lookin' for a come up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I love and
We're just tryna figure everything out
We don't fit in well 'cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear: that we become

Beautiful people
Drop top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
""What d'you do?"" and ""Who d'you know?""
Inside the world of beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Prenups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party

That's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful
Yeah, that's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)

Just a small-town girl, livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train goin' anywhere
Just a city boy, born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train goin' anywhere

The smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile, they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on
Strangers waitin'
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin' in the night
Streetlights, people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night

Workin' hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice
Just one more time

Some will win, some will lose
Some are born to sing the blues
Oh, the movie never ends

Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah

No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot, feet, fail me not

Hop on top, I wanna ride
I do a kegel while it's inside
Spit in my mouth, look in my eyes
This pussy is wet, come take a dive
Tie me up like I'm surprised
Let's roleplay, I'll wear a disguise
I want you to park that big Mack truck right in this little garage
Make it cream, make me scream
Out in public, make a scene
I don't cook, I don't clean
But let me tell you how I got this ring (Ayy, ayy)

Gobble me, swallow me, drip down the side of me (Yeah)
Quick, jump out 'fore you let it get inside of me (Yeah)
I tell him where to put it, never tell him where I'm 'bout to be (Huh)
I'll run down on him 'fore I have a nigga runnin' me (Pow, pow, pow)
Talk your shit, bite your lip (Yeah)
Ask for a car while you ride that dick (While you ride that dick)
You really ain't never gotta fuck him for a thang (Yeah)
He already made his mind up 'fore he came (Ayy, ah)
Now get your boots and your coat for this wet-ass pussy (Ah, ah, ah)
He bought a phone just for pictures of this wet-ass pussy (Click, click, click)
Paid my tuition just to kiss me on this wet-ass pussy (Mwah, mwah, mwah)

Switch my wig, make him feel like he cheatin'
Put him on his knees, give him somethin' to believe in

In the food chain, I'm the one that eat ya
If he ate my ass, he's a bottom-feeder
Big D stand for big demeanor
I could make ya bust before I ever meet ya
If it don't hang, then he can't bang
You can't hurt my feelings, but I like pain
If he fuck me and ask ""Whose is it?""

Quick, jump out 'fore you let it get inside of me (Yeah)
I tell him where to put it, never tell him where I'm 'bout to be (Huh)
I'll run down on him 'fore I have a nigga runnin' me (Pow, pow, pow)
Talk your shit, bite your lip (Yeah)
Ask for a car while you ride that dick (While you ride that dick)
You really ain't never gotta fuck him for a thang (Yeah)
He already made his mind up 'fore he came (Ayy, ah)
Now get your boots and your coat for this wet-ass pussy (Ah, ah, ah)
He bought a phone just for pictures of this wet-ass pussy (Click, click, click)
Paid my tuition just to kiss me on this wet-ass pussy (Mwah, mwah, mwah)
Now make it rain if you wanna see some wet-ass pussy (Yeah, yeah)

Look, I need a hard hitter, need a deep stroker
Need a Henny drinker, need a weed smoker
Not a garter snake, I need a king cobra
With a hook in it, hope it lean over
He got some money, then that's where I'm headed
Pussy A1 just like his credit
He got a beard, well, I'm tryna wet it
I let him taste it, now he diabetic
I don't wanna spit, I wanna gulp
I wanna gag, I wanna choke
I want you to touch that lil' dangly thing that swing in the back of my throat
My head game is fire, punani Dasani
It's goin' in dry and it's comin' out soggy
I ride on that thing like the cops is behind me (Yeah, ah)
I spit on his mic and now he tryna sign me, woo

Your honor, I'm a freak bitch, handcuffs, leashes
Switch my wig, make him feel like he cheatin'
Put him on his knees, give him somethin' to believe in
Never lost a fight, but I'm lookin' for a beatin' (Ah)
In the food chain, I'm the one that eat ya
If he ate my ass, he's a bottom-feeder
Big D stand for big demeanor
I could make ya bust before I ever meet ya
If it don't hang, then he can't bang
You can't hurt my feelings, but I like pain
If he fuck me and ask ""Whose is it?""
When I ride the dick, I'ma spell my name, ah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you fuckin' with some wet-ass pussy
Bring a bucket and a mop for this wet-ass pussy
Give me everything you got for this wet-ass pussy
Now from the top, make it drop, that's some wet-ass pussy
Now get a bucket and a mop, that's some wet-ass pussy
I'm talkin' wap, wap, wap, that's some wet-ass pussy
Macaroni in a pot, that's some wet-ass pussy, huh

Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you

Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though

You stuck in the friend zone, I tell that four-five the fifth, ayy
Hunnid bands inside my shorts, DeChino the shit, ayy
Try to stuff it all in, but it don't even fit, ayy
Know that I been with the shits ever since a jit, ayy
I made my first million, I'm like, ""Shit, this is it,"" ayy
30 for a walkthrough, man, we had that bitch lit, ayy
Had so many bottles, gave ugly girl a sip
Out the window of the Benzo, we get seen in the rent'
And I'm like ""Woah, man, my neck so goddamn cold”
Diamonds wet, my t-shirt soaked
I got homies, let it go, oh
My money thick, won't ever fold
She said, ""Can I have some to hold?""
And I can't ever tell you no

I'm hittin' lil' mama, she wanna have my babies
It's fifty on the pinky, chain so stanky
You should see the whip, promise I can take yo' bitch
Dolla ridin' in an old school Chevy, it's a drop top
Boolin' with a thot-thot, she gon' give me top-top
Just one switch, I can make the ass drop (Hey)
Ayy, take you to the smoke shop
We gon' get high, ayy, we gon' hit Rodeo
Dial up Valentino, we gon' hit Pico
Take you where I'm from, take you to the slums

Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down
Let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down

Yeah, I guess I'm a disappointment, doin' everything I can
I don't wanna make you disappointed, it's annoying
I just wanna make you feel like everything I ever do
Was never tryna make an issue for you, but I guess the more you
Thought about everything you were never even wrong
In the first place, right? Yeah, I'ma just ignore you
Walking towards you with my head down
Lookin' at the ground, I'm embarrassed for you
Paranoia, what did I do wrong this time?
That's parents for you
Very loyal? Shoulda had my back
But you put a knife in it—my hands are full
What else should I carry for you?
I cared for you, but…

Yeah, you don't wanna make this work
You just wanna make this worse
Want me to listen to you, but you don't ever hear my words
You don't wanna know my hurt, yeah
Let me guess, you want an apology, probably
How can we keep going at a rate like this?
We can't, so I guess I'ma have to leave
Please, don't come after me
I just wanna be alone right now, I don't really wanna think at all
Go ahead, just drink it off
Both know you're gonna call tomorrow like nothing's wrong
Ain't that what you always do?

But it's cool, I checked out

Okay, let's put my fake face on and pretend now

You broke me first

Maybe you don't like talking too much about yourself
But you shoulda told me that you were thinking 'bout someone else
You're drunk at a party or maybe it's just that your car broke down
Your phone's been off for a couple of months, so you're calling me now

Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts

I got a lot of toys, 720S bumpin' Fall Out Boy
You was talkin' shit in the beginning (Mm-mm)
Back when I was feelin' more forgivin' (More forgivin')
I know it piss you off to see me winnin' (See me winnin')
See the igloo in my mouth when I be grinnin’ (I be grinnin’), yeah
Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me
Hunnid deep when I roll like the army
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It’s a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', ""Wow"" (Wow, wow)
Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me (On me)

Everywhere I go (Hey)
Catch me on the block like I'm Mutombo (Wow)

Pull up to the house with some big butts
Turn the kitchen counter to a strip-club (Yeah, wow)

I got my first real six-string
Bought it at the five and dime
Played it 'til my fingers bled
Was the summer of '69

Me and some guys from school
Had a band and we tried real hard
Jimmy quit and Jody got married
I should've known we'd never get far
Oh, when I look back now
That summer seemed to last forever
And if I had the choice
Yeah, I'd always wanna be there
Those were the best days of my life

Ain't no use in complainin'
When you got a job to do
I spent my evenings down at the drive-in
And that's when I met you, yeah

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that you'd wait forever
Oh, and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life
Oh, yeah
Back in the summer of '69, oh

Man, we were killin' time
We were young and restless
We needed to unwind
I guess nothing can last forever
Forever, no
Yeah

And now the times are changin'

Oh, and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life

""If you’re feeling low, then give it a go! Try Lambert’s Sniffing Salts today""

You know when you're doing a song about a small town
You gotta start it with a cliché, you know what I'm sayin'?
Like...

Time moves a little slower here
The paint peels, 'cause the summers here are so severe
And we're nowhere near nowhere you would know of
Locals here ride, they show up just to show off
Old men take a load off, just to watch the day go by
Philosophising with their friends like they're Plato
They prophecise on the bench by the main road, right
They got advice; I’m like 'Ayo, if you say so, guys'
But what do they know? Fox News got 'em lit
They’re shook, 'cause fundamentalist the new communist
Old girl with her shopping list clutch her handbag close
I’m like 'Damn, ma'am; Dan, this old bag has jokes'
'Cause I'm a gentleman, but then again, most of us are
First name basis in the bank, the post-office, the bar
The grocer, the park, so lady, I ain’t tryna grab your pension
The old men on the bench hum
""Direct from the transistor radio in your lounge room; It’s the entertainment that the whole family can enjoy""
""Well, I say, looking slick will do the trick, so try Barry’s Brylcreem today!""

Well, let's go, let's go
We're living in the days when everybody sayin'
""What a time to be alive""
But I'm feeling out of place like I live in outer space
'Cause it seems I'm stuck in time
It's like we ride through life
Right in the shadow of the Cold War
It gets so quiet at night
Like martial law took a hold y'all, '55

Time moves a little slower here
A day feels like a week, a week, it feels like it could go a year
And we're nowhere near nothing, man, it's so true
I don't tell 'em where I'm from, I tell 'em where I'm close to
And I can go through an atlas and show you on a map but
You'd still look at me sideways and treat me like I'm backwards
But that's just fine, it so happens I'm
Happy living in a city that is trapped in time
While you're lined up in traffic, I'm
Not panicked 'bout transit, I'm back in time
For a TV dinner and an early night
'Cause we get dressed to travel, got an early flight
Been doing laps of the earth while doing laps of the sun
Tryna put where I'm at on the map 'cause where I'm from
We never get a mention, but all that and then some
Once again, the old men on the bench hum

Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high waisted shorts, oh
She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no

'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love the taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside, it starts to pour

So go easy on me
There ain't no room for things to change

You can't deny how hard I've tried

But now I give up

Five days on the freeway
Ridin' shotgun with you (Yeah, yeah)

We had big dreams in blue (Yeah, yeah)

Hey, it's been too long
Too long ago, my love
Where did we go wrong?
Too late to turn around

Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh na-na (Ayy, ayy)

He didn't walk up with that ""how you doin'?"" (Uh)
When he came in the room
He said there's a lot of girls I can do with (Uh)
But I can't without you
I knew him forever in a minute (Hey)
That summer night in June
And papa says he got malo in him (Uh)

Back it on me (Back it up)
Shawty cravin' on me, get to eatin' on me (On me)
She waited on me (And what?)
Shawty cakin' on me, got the bacon on me (Wait up)

When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""

Yeah, I'd rather be a lover than a fighter (Fighter)
'Cause all my life, I've been fighting
Never felt a feeling of comfort, oh
And all this time, I've been hiding
And I never had someone to call my own, oh nah
I'm so used to sharing
Love only left me alone
But I'm at one with the silence

I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been quiet for too long
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been silent for too long
I've been quiet for too long
I've been quiet for too long
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been quiet for too long

I'm in need of a savior (Savior), but I'm not asking for favors
My whole life, I've felt like a burden
I think too much, and I hate it
I'm so used to being in the wrong, I'm tired of caring
Loving never gave me a home, so I'll sit here in the silence

I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been quiet for too long
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying

Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no ""Mrs.""
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, ""Which one?"" I say, ""Nah, I want all of 'em""
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms

My smile is beamin' (Yeah), my skin is gleamin' (Is gleamin')
The way it shine, I know you've seen it (You've seen it)
I bought a crib just for (Just for) the closet (Closet)
Both his and hers, I want it, I got it, yeah

I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it

When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set

Hah

Slide on it pimp game with my pinky ring
Lotta gang, lotta bitches, and a icy chain
Why you claim that you rich? That's a false claim
I be straight to the whip, no baggage claim
Whole lotta styles, can't even pronounce the name
You ain't got no style, see you on my Instagram
I be rockin' it like it's fresh out the pan
Only when I'm takin' pics, I'm the middleman
Walk, talk it like a boss, I just lift a hand
Three million cash, call me Rain Man
Money like a shower, that's my rain dance
And we all in black, like it's Gangland
Say the wrong words, you be hangman
Watch me stick to your bitch like a spray tan

Lotta girls like me, niggas wanna fight me
Nigga, get your ass checked like a fuckin' Nike
Me not icy, that's unlikely
And she gon' suck me like a fuckin' Hi-C
Aw, chains on the neck for the whole team
And I feel like Gucci with the ice cream
And my bitch want the Fenty, not the Maybelline

The smell of you in every single dream I dream

You're the one I have decided who's one of my kind

Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me

So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know ﻿I was lost

I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
I hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game﻿ made for everyone
And love is the prize

So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older

Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia

Pass the Courvoisier (Hey, hey)
In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (Ayy)
This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A
Laughing all the way to the bank, I spray flames

Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled, did so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on the guy with a missile launcher

How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball

Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her

Swearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious

Obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me outta me
You don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
And be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter

Thursday, July 16, 2020
Running against the clock, but the clock hated me on 10 pm 20
Intricate day, let me say I was a little busy
Apply my family orders like a pizza man delivery
Jogging l3am kaml even I’m fat, like a machine gun
But 365 never shares or d-d-divided with me
History save!, before I get taped
I don’t wanna drop the key, I wanna be at the end a fairy tail
It’s time to spit what I’m felling on the paper
Shocking content get some sugar or bring some pepper
It took me days to write this with my flavor
I ain't got no wheels, I’m a true pro player like a faker
While I remember the girl that dated she was bhal Tayka
Evil with the makeup, then we break up
Zero percent chances like a naked, the truth rises the silence
The silence kills, Start the funeral, Bury me, invite the undertaker
I’m telling you Whenever, wherever whichever
Whoever I’m already dead inside, however
I just wanna recall the day that I stepped outside
Waddling like duck perhaps at the mid of night
Catching up a taxi Hello sir where you want to go
Please put me in avenue look at me
I called that, I struggle with that cuz I'm lonely
How this verse could be good enough if got somebody
Should I wait another day, another day, another day
Another day, another day, another day
Should I wait another day, another day, another day
Another day, another day, another day
Should I wait another day, another day, another day
Another day, another day, another day
Should I wait, Should I wait another day, another day
Should I wait another day

Yeah, chilling on my room, eyes up on the roof
Listening to deathbed Powfu
Thinking on a clue for my puzzle to make proof
Life moves leisurely in such a sort of crossword clues
I don’t know why, why this make changes on me
Such randomly, occasionally through my moods
I guess that I’m not the only one with the same groove
Stir the water, the thirsty might show up with the same view
Take or leave it until another day
In any way, you’ll get that we’re all in the same crew
Maybe we’ll make Rendez-Vous in the heaven
For the remission of our sins just say Lahi3fu Or probably Hallelu
Well this, started already get me confused

Probably everybody wanna know who I am

Turn it up and throw a tantrum
This that throw up in your Birkin bag
Hook up with someone random
This that social awkward suicide
That buy your lips and buy your likes
I swear she had a man
But shit hit different when it's Thursday night
That college dropout music
Every day leg day, she be too thick
And my friends are all annoying
But we go dumb, yeah, we go stupid
This that 10K on the table
Just so we can be secluded
And the vodka came diluted
One more line, I'm superhuman

Fuck you, and you, and you

When you close your eyes, tell me, what are you dreamin'?

And I might never get there, but I'm gonna try
If it's ten thousand hours or the rest of my life
I'm gonna love you (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)

And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone (Ooh)

Take a seat
Right over there, sat on the stairs
Stay or leave
The cabinets are bare, and I'm unaware
Of just how we got into this mess, got so aggressive
I know we meant all good intentions

So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close?
Why don't you come on over?
I can't just let you go
Oh baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?

I left my heart to the sappers round Khe Sanh
And my soul was sold with my cigarettes
To the black market man
I've had the Vietnam cold turkey
From the ocean to the Silver City
And it's only other vets could understand

About the long forgotten dockside guarantees
How there were no V-Day heroes in 1973
How we sailed into Sydney Harbour
Saw an old friend but couldn't kiss her
She was lined, and I was home to the lucky land
Well she was like so many more from that time on
Their lives were all so empty
Till they found their chosen one
And their legs were often open
But their minds were always closed
And their hearts were held in fast suburban chains

And the legal pads were yellow
Hours long, pay-packets lean
And the telex writers clattered
Where the gunships once had been
But the car parks made me jumpy
And I never stopped the dreams
Or the growing need for speed and novocain

So I worked across the country end to end
Tried to find a place to settle down
Where my mixed up life could mend
Held a job on an oil-rig
Flying choppers when I could
But the nightlife nearly drove me round the bend

And I've travelled round the world from year to year
And each one found me aimless
One more year the worse for wear
And I've been back to South East Asia
And the answer sure ain't there
But I'm drifting north, to check things out again
Yes I am!

You know the last plane out of Sydney's almost gone

One more year the worse for wear
And I've been back to South East Asia
And the answer sure ain't there
But I'm drifting north, to check things out again
Yes I am!

Sí, sabes que ya llevo un rato mirándote
Tengo que bailar contigo hoy (¡D.Y.!)
Vi que tu mirada ya estaba llamándome
Muéstrame el camino que yo voy
¡Oh!
Tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Sólo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso (¡Oh, yeah!)
Ya, ya me está gustando más de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro
Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmar las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
(Sube, sube, sube; sube, sube)

Quiero ver bailar tu pelo, quiero ser tu ritmo (Woh, eh)
Que le enseñes a mi boca (Woh, eh)

Hasta provocar tus gritos (Woh, eh)

Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empezamos lento, después salvaje

Nos vamo' pegando, poquito a poquito
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza

Show me the way that I'm going

I am getting closer and I am putting together the plan
Just thinking about it makes your pulse race (Oh, yeah!)
Yeah, I'm liking it more than usual
All my senses are asking for more
This must be taken without any rush
Slowly
I want to breathe your neck slowly
Let me tell you things in my ear
So that you remember if you are not with me
Slowly
I want to undress you with kisses slowly
Sign the walls of your maze
And make your body a whole manuscript

Fallin' out in a drought
No flow, rain wasn't pourin' down (Pourin' down)
See, that pain was all around
See, my mode was kinda lounged
Didn't know which, which way to turn
Flow was cool but I still felt burnt
Energy up, you can feel my surge

Let's just get this straight for a second, I'ma work (Yuh)
Even if I don't get paid for progression, I'ma get it (Uh, get it)
Everything that I do is electric (Ayy)
I'ma keep it in a motion, keep it movin' like kinetic, ayy (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Everything that I say, man, I seen you deflate
Let me elevate, this ain't a prank
Have you walkin' on a plank, li-li-li-li-like
Both hands together, God, let me pray (Now let me pray), uh
I've been goin' right, right around, call that relay (Masked Wolf)
Pass the baton, back and I'm on

For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness' sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well, I ain't

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up

I'm a whole different person (I'm a whole different person)
It's a gift and a curse (It's a gift and a curse)

And now I'm drinkin' too much, so I'ma talk with a slur
Last time I saw you, it ended in a blur
I woke up in a hearse
You said, ""You loved me first"" (First)
One thing my dad told me was, ""Never let your woman know when you're insecure""
So I put Gucci on the fur
And I put my wrist on iceberg
One thing my heart tells me is
""Flex on a ho every time they're insecure""
I can't see it through, I'm running from you
Is your love for real? (For real? For real?)
Is your love really true?

Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen, still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet

Can't keep my hands to myself
Think I'll dust 'em off, put 'em back up on the shelf
In case my little baby girl is in need
Am I coming out of left field?

Might be over now, but I feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks now
Let me kick it like it's 1986 now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

Leave it with a babysitter, mama, call the gravedigger
Gone with the fallen leaves

Might've had your fill, but you feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks now
Let me kick it like it's 1986 now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

We could fight a war for peace
(Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks now)
Give in to that easy living
Goodbye to my hopes and dreams
Start flipping for my enemies
Or we could wait until the walls come down
(Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks now)
It's time to give a little to the kids in the middle
But, oh, until it falls, won't bother me

I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (Fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""

I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted

If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""

I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?

I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
Achilles and his gold
Hercules and his gifts
Spider-Man's control
And Batman with his fists
And clearly I don't see myself upon that list

But she said, where d'you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss

Hey, hey, hey
Good to see you
Come on, dude, let's go
Yeah, let's go
Hahaha, alright
Alright, okay
Uh, alright, okay
Alright, okay

Return of the Mack
Get 'em; what it is? What it does? What it is? What it isn't?
Looking for a better way to get up outta bed
Instead of getting on the Internet
And checking on who hit me, get up
Thrift shop, pimp-strut walkin'
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Sweater game, nope, nope, y'all can't copy, yeah
Bad, moonwalking, this here is our party
My posse's been on Broadway, and we did it our way
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones
Into everything I record to it and yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit, hustlin'
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen
With the four-track, bussin'
Halfway 'cross that city with the back (Back) pack (Pack), fat (Fat) cat (Cat), crushin'
Labels out here, now they can't tell me nothin' (Hey, hey, hey)
We give that to the people, spread it across the country (Hey, hey, hey, oh)

So we put our hands up

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Now, can I kick it? Thank you
Yeah, I'm so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But that's what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Y'all can't stop me
Go hard like I got a 808 in my heartbeat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on Shark Week, raw
Time to go off, I'm gone
Deuces, goodbye, I got a world to see
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer
Nah, I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Now, sing a song, and it goes like
Raise those hands, this is our party (Hey, hey, hey)
We came here to live life like nobody was watching (Hey, hey, hey, oh)
I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me (Hey, hey, hey)
Learn from that failure, gain humility (Hey, hey, hey)

You know I'm back, like I never left (I never left)
Another sprint, another step (Another step)
Another day, another breath (Another breath)
Been chasing dreams, but I never slept (I never slept)
I got a new attitude and a lease on life and some peace of mind
Seek and I find, I can sleep when I die
Want a piece of the pie, grab the keys to the ride
And shit I'm straight, I'm on my wave, I'm on my wave
Get out my wake, I'm running late, what can I say?
I heard you die twice, once when they bury you in the grave
And the second time is the last time that somebody mentions your name
So when I leave here on this earth, did I take more than I gave?
Did I look out for the people, or did I do it all for fame?
Legend, it's exodus, searching for euphoria
Trudging through the mud to find the present, no ignoring us
Got 20,000 deep off in the street like we some warriors
My mama told me never bow your head, woo
I feel glorious, glorious
Got a chance to start again
I was born for this, born for this
It's who I am, how could I forget?
I made it through the darkest part of the night
And now I see the sunrise
Now I feel glorious, glorious
I feel glorious, glorious

I'm feeling glorious
The crib looking Victorian (Oh yes it is)
You know that we been going in (Been going in)
Since we hopped out that DeLorean (DeLorean, yeah we win)
En garde, things are just things, they don't make you who you are
Can't pack up a U-Haul and take it with you when you're gone
We posted on the porch, my family's glasses to the stars
My grandma smiling down on me like ""Woo, that boy got bars""
Okay, okay, yes I do
I said amen and hallelujah, let me testify too
Another morning, a morning, won't let self get in my way
I got my breath, I got my faith and I remember why I came, woo

I feel glorious, glorious
Got a chance to start again

Broken people down with words

Known to be crazy, known to be wild

Ain't no stranger to the troubles at my door
I've been at the wrong place at the wrong time
Chasin' all the wrong things most of my life
Been every kinda lost that you can't find
But I got one thing right
Been the kinda guy girls' mamas don’t like
Runnin’ with the wrong crowd on the wrong nights
'Cause I’ve been wrong about a million times
But I got one thing right, you

(Baby, I got one thing right)
Mmm
(Baby, I got one thing right)
Yeah, I got you

You saw right through my pain
Kept us patient while I changed

Okay, I realize now, that everything that I did was wrong
Okay, I realize now, some things are better off said than done
Okay, I realize now, that maybe I'm not ready for love
Okay, I realize now, I finished us before we begun-un-un

I'm done, so done, I'm done with all the games you play
I'm numb, so numb, I'm numb to all the pain you bring
I'm tryna figure this all out for myself
I don't need you or nobody else, I'm done, so done
So done, so done, so done, so done, I'm done
(Oh no, no-no-no, no-no-no)
I think that it's time for you to realize
That I'm not gon' be here forever but I
Wish that I was, but you were the cause
For every lil' feelin' I'm feeling inside
Sometimes I sit and I think about why
I even trusted you, shit, I'm surprised
I'm walkin' away from you, it's about time
Want you to walk out and walk out of my life
And you, yeah, you (Yeah, you)
You stay on my mind way more than I would like for you to
And you, yeah, you
The reason I can't find no love, don't wanna find no one

Put your loving hands out, baby

I walked away, you won me then
But easy come and easy go and it would end
So anytime I bleed, you let me go
Yah, anytime I feed, you get me know
Anytime I seek, you let me know
But I planted that seed, just let me grow
I'm on my knees when I'm beggin'

Uh, put your loving hands out, baby

Tried so hard to be your man
The kind of man you want in the end
Only then can I begin to live again

She can grow right from her womb a family
Provide lovin' overlooked and unappreciated, you see (Yeah)
You can reciprocate
I got delicious taste, you need a woman's touch in your place
Just protect her and keep her safe
Baby, worship my hips and waist
So feminine with grace
I touch your soul when you hear me say, ""Boy""
Let me be your woman

Put some babies in your life and take away the drama
Put the paper in a picture like a diorama
Gotta face a lot of people of the opposite
'Cause the world told me, ""We ain't got the common sense""
Gotta prove it to myself that I'm on top of shit
And you would never know a god without the goddesses
Honest as fuckin' honest get
And I could be on everything
I mean I could be the leader, head of all the states
I could smile and jiggle it 'til his pockets empty
I could be the CEO, just look at Robyn Fenty
And I'ma be there for you 'cause you on my team, girl
Don't ever think you ain't hella these niggas dream girl
They wanna pit us against each other
When we succeedin' for no reasons
They wanna see us end up like we Regina on Mean Girls

Before I die, I'm tryna fuck you, baby

Bands too long for a nigga so cheap
And your flex OD, and your sex OD

Pretty lil' thing, you got a bag and now you wildin'
You just took it off the lot, no mileage
Way they hittin' you, the DM lookin' violent
Talkin' wild, you come around and now they silent
Flew the coop at seventeen, no guidance
You be stayin' low, but you know what the vibes is
Ain't never got you nowhere bein' modest
Poppin' shit but only 'cause you know you poppin', yeah
You got it, girl, you got it (Ayy)

I was distracted and in traffic
I didn't feel it when the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin', were you out drinkin'?
Were you in the living room, chillin', watchin' television?
It's been a year now, think I've figured out how
How to let you go and let communication die out

I know, you know, we know you weren't
Down for forever and it's fine
I know, you know, we know we weren't
Meant for each other and it's fine
But if the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it?
All our fears would be irrelevant
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
The sky'd be falling and I'd hold you tight
And there wouldn't be a reason why
We would even have to say goodbye
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right? Right?
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right? Right?

I tried to imagine your reaction
It didn't scare me when the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin', the night we went drinkin'
Stumbled in the house and didn't make it past the kitchen
Ah, it's been a year now, think I've figured out how

From the motion picture that revolves around life
Living in projects, growing up around mice
Not to mention rats, all the boosters down in Crown Heights
Single parent home where you mother ain’t around nights
Working double shifts, barely keeping on house lights
Making sure tuition paid and my words pronounced right
Life doesn’t short change me so I know count twice
No it doesn’t nice, it’s downright atrocious
But she built the character that made me ferocious
Relentless and focused.  Go hard, there is no risk
Turned our hopelessness back into courage
The cowardly lion on the yellow brick road
Has the heart of a lion that the king of jungles
This baby Simba has grown like his father
Now they hear me roar and I resemble Mustafa
Chorus:
Assassinate my character, slander my name
Say what you will but I shall remain
I’m invincible I-I-I’m Invincible  (6x)
I’m sitting on the sidelines , like “what am I waiting for”
Gillie’s telling me it my turn, I gotta take it all
I hear all the rumors, I just brush the haters off
If you don’t believe in me, why you wanna stay involved
Know your role, play your part, you don’t got a hand in this
You are just an agent, I am Mr. Anderson
Knowing what I’ve overcome, I feel like a champion
All I need is room to hang my championship banners in
Came from the bottom and rose to the top
Playing the possum and honing my plot
Sticks and stones may break my bones but discouraging words can’t hold or stop
Me from my destiny, chosen to rock
I wait in the wing for my moment to pop
They say, what about the diploma you got?
I go through the roadblocks lonesome alot
Don’t give a middle finger what you say
You can duck sick unless bucks you pay
I’m a shut you naysayers up someday
And today feels like my lucky day
Don’t understand? Then it must be vague
I’m a spell it out clear cause it must be Shake
I-I-I-I-I’m the leader of the new cool

Bridge: 2x
I’m invincible, but no superman
But I feel like kryptonite in Lex Luther’s hands
I’m invincible, but not bullet proof

I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?

Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
I'm not just tryna get you back on me (Oh, no, no)

Walking down 29th and park
I saw you in another's arm
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said something to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do

Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're moving on with someone new
'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself
You're happier, aren't you?

Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody need you like I do
I know that there's others that deserve you
But my darling, I am still in love with you

But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I’ll feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

‘Cause baby you look happier, you do
I knew one day you’d fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know that I’ll be waiting here for youYou might also like111Embed","TranslationsEspañolPortuguêsHappier Lyrics

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night

To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

Hey! Where's the drums?
Woo, oh, oh, oh
Let's go!

Ooh, girl, you're shining like a 5th Avenue diamond
And they don't make you like they used to
You're never going out of style
Ooh, pretty baby, this world might have gone crazy
The way you saved me, who could blame me?
When I just wanna make you smile?
I wanna thrill you like Michael
I wanna kiss you like Prince
Let's get it on like Marvin Gaye, like Hathaway
Write a song for you like this

You're over my head, I'm out of my mind
Thinking I was born in the wrong time
One of a kind, living in a world gone plastic
Baby, you're so classic (Yeah, yeah, so classic)
Baby, you're so classic (Yeah, baby you)
Baby, you're so classic

Four dozen of roses, anything for you to notice
All the way to serenade you, doing it Sinatra style
I'ma pick you up in a Cadillac, like a gentleman bringing glamour back
Keep it real to real in the way I feel
I could walk you down the aisle

I wanna thrill you like Michael
I wanna kiss you like Prince

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said ""Bye Suzanne""
After the first night, but tonight I am
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

A one-night stand turned a two-night stand
It was ""come sunlight, scram,"" now we hug tight, and...
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit

Well, little one (I'm sorry)

Why men great 'til they gotta be great?
Woo!

I just took a DNA test, turns out I'm 100% that bitch
Even when I'm crying crazy
Yeah, I got boy problems, that's the human in me
Bling bling, then I solve 'em, that's the goddess in me
You coulda had a bad bitch, non-committal
Help you with your career just a little
You're 'posed to hold me down, but you're holding me back
And that's the sound of me not calling you back
Why men great 'til they gotta be great? ('Til they gotta be great)
Don't text me, tell it straight to my face (Tell it straight to my face)
Best friend sat me down in the salon chair (Down in the salon chair)
Shampoo press, get you out of my hair
Fresh photos with the bomb lighting (With the bomb lighting)
New man on the Minnesota Vikings (Minnesota Vikings)
Truth hurts, needed something more exciting (Yee)
Bom bom bi dom bi dum bum bay (Eh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

You tried to break my heart?
Oh, that breaks my heart
That you thought you ever had it
No, you ain't from the start
Hey, I'm glad you're back with your bitch
I mean, who would wanna hide this?
I will never, ever, ever, ever, ever be your side chick
I put the sing in single
Ain't worried 'bout a ring on my finger
So you can tell your friend, ""Shoot your shot"" when you see him
It's okay, he already in my DMs

You must think that I'm a fool

'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt
But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you

Do you recall, not long ago
We would walk on the sidewalk?
Innocent, remember?
All we did was care for each other
But the night was warm
We were bold and young
All around, the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
A-A-All we need is somebody to lean on

(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)

What will we do when we get old?
Will we walk down the same road?
Will you be there by my side?
Standin' strong as the waves roll over
When the nights are long
Longing for you to come home
All around, the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go

And I've been keeping to myself (Self)
I had my eyes up on the prize
Ain't watching anybody else
But your love, it hit me hard, girl
Yeah, you're bad for my health
I love the cards that I've been dealt
Do you feel the same as well?
You know I used to be in 1D (Now I'm out, free)
People want me for one thing (That's not me)
I'm not changing the way that I (Used to be)
I just wanna have fun and (Get rowdy)
One Coke and Bacardi (Sippin' lightly)
When I walk inside the party (Girls on me)
F1 type Ferrari (Six gear speed)
Girl, I love it when your body (Grinds on me, baby)
Oh yeah, oh

You know I love it when the music's loud
But come on, strip that down for me, baby
Now there's a lot of people in the crowd
But only you can dance with me
So put your hands on my body
And swing that round for me, baby (Swing)

(Tahj Money)
(I bet my last track probably gave you lockjaw, hey, Lilkdubb)

I think about you on the road when I tear down the booth
Girl, I can't wait 'til I get home to fuck the shit out of you
Even on your worst days, girl, you still kind of cute
If it go down, I'm gon' protect you, pull that stick out and shoot
All I want is your love, I can't see no bitch after you
Off emotions, we did things that we didn't have to do
Scared of you leaving, I told lies when you asked for the truth
I second-guessed if you the one, that's when I didn't have a clue
They be Martin and Gina, but we ain't think about behind the scenes
The way I kill it, lose her voice when she tryin' to scream
We from the trenches, we moved onto the finer things
Now you done went from H&M to a designer fiend
He was playing games, got you dancing in the middle of the club
Got you dancing in the middle of the club
I know what you chasing, you can only get this feeling from a thug
You can only get this feeling from a thug
Tears falling, and it's liquor in your cup, all you really want is love
Baby, all you really want is love
Only talk to bosses, independent, can't be fucking with a scrub
Girl, I know you can't be fucking with a scrub (Kdubb)

I get this feeling in my stomach when you next to me
Man, I'm tryna get to know you sexually
Take you on shopping sprees for therapy
Move you out to Cali', in my mansion takin' care of me
I know sometime I'm crazy, I was hopin' you could bear with me
Beauty and the beast, pretty girl with a gangster
I swear you still the baddest in the room with no makeup
You the type of woman every hood nigga pray for
I vow to stay a hundred, never change up
In that sundress, damn, your body so amazing
Love the way you smell, I'm addicted to your fragrance
It's somethin' about you, but I really can't explain it
Just know that you mine, I tell that nigga he can save it

He was playing games, got you dancing in the middle of the club
Got you dancing in the middle of the club

Get 'em; what it is? What it does? What it is? What it isn't?
Looking for a better way to get up outta bed
Instead of getting on the Internet
And checking on who hit me, get up
Thrift shop, pimp-strut walkin'
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Sweater game, nope, nope, y'all can't copy, yeah
Bad, moonwalking, this here is our party
My posse's been on Broadway, and we did it our way
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones
Into everything I record to it and yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit, hustlin'
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen
With the four-track, bussin'
Halfway 'cross that city with the back (Back) pack (Pack), fat (Fat) cat (Cat), crushin'

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Now, can I kick it? Thank you
Yeah, I'm so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But that's what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Y'all can't stop me
Go hard like I got a 808 in my heartbeat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on Shark Week, raw
Time to go off, I'm gone
Deuces, goodbye, I got a world to see
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer
Nah, I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Now, sing a song, and it goes like
Raise those hands, this is our party (Hey, hey, hey)
We came here to live life like nobody was watching (Hey, hey, hey, oh)
I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me (Hey, hey, hey)

Yeah, I just wanna feel this way forever
How we did when we were young
Yeah, I know I've been changing
Yeah, life's been rearranging
Those times were golden, but I—
I couldn't hold 'em all at once
I lost that moment
But now I got it back, yeah, I ain't gonna give it up

Yeah
You know, growing up happened so fast
And you only get your first times once
Those moments were special, like
The first breath, first step, first chick, first kiss
First time in love, first time on drugs
The first time I heard Pac, the first time it's all new
The first time the earth stopped, the first time I saw you
Yeah, those moments I'll always hold onto
Forever stained in my brain in a golden hue
Like when I was a kid just dreaming of the things I've built
Those autumn leaves would cover my hood in a crimson quilt
The world was mine and the memory of my home
Still triggered by the smell of fresh snow and pinecones
Those early days of the six-packs and stimulants
Before the demons came and kidnapped my innocence
Before life swept me up and I was hurled in
And I lost pieces of myself up in this whirlwind
But I had to find them again, 'cause they're the miracle
That took me from feeling invisible to invincible, yeah

Yeah, I just wanna feel this way forever
How we did when we were young
Yeah, I know I've been changing
Yeah, life's been rearranging
Those times were golden, but I—
I couldn't hold 'em all at once

But now I got it back, yeah, I ain't gonna give it up

Yo, see I remember how it felt making paper planes
Pretending I was Superman so I could save the day
I swear that I would see Santa if I could stay awake
And finding ways to fly away was like my great escape
An only child, a single mother, a small apartment
Didn't have that silver spoon, but we were always laughing
Staring at the clouds, chatting for hours
Where a simple smell lets me time travel through flowers
And I'm happy I believed, and everything happens for a reason
'Cause if your angel dies and your worlds crashing through your ceiling
Hopefully you know you own a map to your own freedom
Realise tears dry and it's a natural way of healing, yo

Yeah, I just wanna feel this way forever

They say time is precious and there's no going back
Shit, if I could only unfreeze this photograph
And dive in the windows of my eyes to feel how I felt
Inside right in that moment in time, I'd bring it all back to life
So fuck the money, cars, and accessories

Na, na, na, na, ooh
Oh, no, oh, ayy

Put it in drive, I'll be outside, I'll be on the way
I'll be on the way
You can meet me in five, I'll be all night, I'll be a-all day
I'll be a-all day
Put it in drive, I'll be outside, I'll be on the way
I'll be on the way
You can meet me in five, I'll be all night, I'll be all day

Yeah, yeah, yeah
This the type of shit that you been waiting all year for
Back in town for a minute if you with it (yeah)
Got a lot of time, I just need somewhere to spend it
I just press a button and the top go missing
I kept the slip so you know it's not rented, yeah, oh, oh
What you wanna do?
Worried 'bout your friends, they saw you this afternoon
I been reading your mind
No fair, but you gotta let me know
I'm all ears and I got a lot of room in my whip
If you wanna take it there, I'm on my way

Put it in drive, I'll be outside, I'll be on the way
I'll be on the way
You can meet me in five, I'll be all night, I'll be all day

Drop top the Porsche, put that bitch in sport
Out here in the field, oh yeah (yeah), I'm already here, yeah
Come outside, looking like a snack, hurry up, get in, hell yeah (yeah)
Come with me on this mission (ooh yeah, ooh yeah)
Riding down the coast (ooh yeah), I want that for sure (ooh yeah)
You say, ""Play Khalid"" (ooh yeah)
I say, ""Pass the weed"" (ooh yeah)
Pull up to the crib, oh, said you've never been before
Put you in Provocateur, girl, I made you mi amor
You said you left your ex, that dude was always gassin'
You said before me, you ain't never been this happy
You took an L with him and winning ever since (ever since)
You hit my phone, I'm on my way, I cancel plans, yeah, yeah

You tryna make a move
Tonight I got the time, tell me what you wanna do
Call the squad if you wanna rendezvous
They gon' push up on they own, I only got room for two
From the 'jects on the set, it's a Porsche, not a 'Vette
I confess, I'ma flex till they show some respect
Get away so we can make sense of your life
You was in park but I just put your shit in drive
Now coast like there's no tomorrow
Moving too fast, I'm open to drive slow (yeah)
I don't want you to wonder where I go
Can learn a lot from this and that's something that I know

Bust down on my wrist in this bitch
My pinky-ring bigger than his
Met her out in Beverly Hills, ayy
Dolla got too many girls, ayy
Met her out in Beverly Hills
All she wear is red bottom heels
When she back it up, put it on the Snap
When she droppin' low, put it on the Gram
DJ poppin', she gon' swallow that
Champagne poppin', she gon' swallow that

When I'm poppin' them bananas, we don't link chimps for that

Bless her heart, she throwing shots but every line sucks
