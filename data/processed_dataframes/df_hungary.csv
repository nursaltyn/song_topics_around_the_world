Mondd el, miért, miért van, hogy fáj?
Miért van, hogy bárhová megyek
Az éj leple alatt újra és újra rám találsz?
Miért is félsz? Hisz feladtad már
És esténként várod, hogy mit hoz a holnap
De tudod, hogy úgyis ugyanaz vár
És feladod még egyszer
Igen, ma is kicsit akarom, hogy élessz fel
Gyere be, add azt, amit ezelőtt éreztem!
Gyere be, add azt, amit ezelőtt éreztem!
Nem voltam bátor, nem voltam jó
Mégis rád várok

Mert úgyis minden mindegy nekem már
Én nem is akartam mást, a szívembe zártam már
Minden problémám, ami reggel visszatér hozzám
Én nem is akartam mást, a szívеmbe zártam már
Minden problémát, ami reggеl visszatér hozzám

Neked nem megy, neked nem
Csak telik az idő, és nem ébredtem fel
Csak az álmomban érhetlek el
De kattan a vekker és vége lesz
Nem akarom, hogy fájjon, nem akarom, hogy bántson
Nem akarom, hogy vétkezzen
Én őt mindig haza várom, nekem ő az álmom
Ebben az életben
De miért fáj, hova mész, lány?
Nem értettük egymást meg
Nem érsz rám, kihez mész át?
Pedig te vagy az egyetlen
Csak várj-áj, nekem idebent úgy fáj-áj!
Nem akarok én már mást-mást (Most, ó, nem, nem, nem)

Tudom, egyszer hazatalálsz

Tell me why, why does it hurt?
Why is it that I go anywhere
Do you find me again and again under the cover of night?
Why are you afraid? You've already given up
And in the evenings you wait for what tomorrow will bring
But you know it's the same waiting anyway
And you give up one more time
Yes, I still want you to liven things up a bit today
Come in, give me what I felt before!
Come in, give me what I felt before!
I wasn't brave, I wasn't good
I'm still waiting for you

Because it doesn't matter to me anyway
I didn't want anything else, I already locked it in my heart
All my problems that come back to me in the morning
I didn't want anything else, I already locked it in my heart
All the problems that come back to me in the morning

It doesn't work for you, it doesn't work for you
Time just passes and I didn't wake up
I can only reach you in my dreams
But the alarm goes off and it's over
I don't want him to hurt, I don't want him to hurt me
I don't want you to sin
I always wait for him at home, he is my dream
In this life
But why does it hurt, where are you going girl?
We didn't understand each other
You can't get me, who are you moving to?
You're the only one though
Just wait, oh, I'm in so much pain here!
I don't want anything else (Now, oh, no, no, no)

Return
I know you'll find home someday
I'll just wait a little longer
I know you'll find home someday

Because it doesn't matter to me anyway
I didn't want anything else, I already locked it in my heart
All my problems that come back to me in the morning
I didn't want anything else, I already locked it in my heart
All my problems that come back to me in the morning

Lépjél vissza, tovább élsz, élsz

Nagyra nőttem, nem locsoltak, de nem dobálok levelet
Maradj lent
Pereg az ötforintos
Faszi, húzd a nyakadra a H&M-es gyűrűdet
Pont beért, nekem, nekem pont elég
Biztos láttad, ahogy flexelek, csak pont beállt a kuss
Hallom, hogy egyre nagyon minden, mint a hibáid
Gyorsabb lett a kocsid, de te már lassabban futsz

Lépj rá
Addig gyorsulj, amíg nem fáj
Az ilyen emberekért nem kár
Kanyar előtt ránt a kormány

You need all the money, money
You go backwards, you go, you go
You would still be moving forward
Step back, you live on, you live
Your girlfriend looks at me, looks, looks
But you under-packaged everything

Stay down
I don't give a place
I grew up, I wasn't watered, but I don't throw leaves
Stay down
The five forints are worth it
Fuck, put your H&M ring on your neck
Just enough, for me, just enough for me
You must have seen me flexing, but it just stopped
I hear it's getting a lot like your mistakes
Your car has become faster, but you are already running slower

Step on it
Accelerate until it hurts
It's not a pity for such people

Alas, the hardest night

I take out student loans before my phone
You don't have to do it, you know, it's just free money
If the cart starts, there is no brake

Woah, woah
Le-le-lefele dzsalózunk
E-E-Ezi papa vezet
Ezek Budai-hegyek
Idő Urait hallgatunk mi a Burai helyett
Ezek ugyanolyanok, a nyakukba lihegek
Ezek udvari bolondok
Sok wannabe gyerek, a ház fala didereg
Csak egy kilences busz kellett, hogy hazavigyelek
Apám nem unatkozott, sokat ivott, drogozott
És a mag, amit elvetett, lassan kibontakozott

Felizzik a galagonya, lassan felég a bozót (Felég a bozót)
Nem írom ezt a filmet, én csak feliratozom, já

Amerre én járok, arra bámul a világ (Á)

Woah, woah
We are jealous up and down
E-E-This dad is driving
These are the Buda Mountains
We listen to Lords of Time instead of Burai
These are the same, I'm breathing down their necks
These are court fools
Lots of wannabe kids, the walls of the house are shaking
All I needed was a number nine bus to take me home
My father was not bored, he drank a lot and took drugs
And the seed he sowed slowly unfolded

The hawthorn grows, the bush slowly burns (Enough of the bush)
I'm not writing this movie, I'm just subbing, yay

Where I go, the world stares (Ah)
I stand among the blind and the one who sees will tell me (Ah)

Catch a feeling far from home

It's time to do it backwards (Get it back)
I got you slippin' through that hole
Stripped down to the bones
Feelin' low

It's 6:30 AM and I wake up at the railway station
Last night I thought I'd give a visitation
But two hours later we got fucked up
Really got fucked up
The whole night got lost
And now I'm stuck in the depressing reality (Stuck here)
Sittin' in the back, feelin' higher than I've ever been, uh
But I've never been honest, never been true to you
So I should leave you (Baby)
I should get lost, like I should head out
Oh, why, tell me why
Tell me, why should I believe you?
A second part, a second chance
A second half, a second man
And secondary love songs' stumblin' in my head
But when my mind is connectin' to the music
Feelin' like this soul gave me authority to use it
Babylon is a ticking bomb, nobody would defuse it
Already hearing the gunshots

Pakolom a cuccom, bandukolok az utcán
Túltoltam az éjjelt

The whole night got lost
And now I'm stuck in the depressing reality (Stuck here)
Sittin' in the back, feelin' higher than I've ever been, uh
But I've never been honest, never been true to you
So I should leave you (Baby)
I should get lost, like I should head out
Oh, why, tell me why
Tell me, why should I believe you?
A second part, a second chance
A second half, a second man
And secondary love songs' stumblin' in my head
But when my mind is connectin' to the music
Feelin' like this soul gave me authority to use it
Babylon is a ticking bomb, nobody would defuse it
Already hearing the gunshots
Ra-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa
Pakolom a cuccom, bandukolok az utcán
Túltoltam az éjjelt
Éld a léted te is tagadásban!
Úgy tudod, minden kicsikét másabb
Örökké fiatalon élj, ha az utamon jársz!
Belevisz a bankó, neked lehet, hogy tény
Nekem lehet nem jó
Lehet szomorú a vége, de kiveszem a részem
Nem maradok ébren, fentmaradok, hidd el

Ó
Sokan elmentek, áh
Magamat tettem azzá, amit bekebelezek
Flowban vagyok, míg a fele ki nem megyeget
Sziasztok gyerekek! (Szia, Azi!)

Leavin' at the backdoor
(Leavin' to the backrooms)
And catch a feeling far from home
(Keep that butterfly knife on my side though, homicide)
It's time to do it backwards
I got you slippin' through that hole
Stripped down to the bones
Closin' doors

But one day I will break those chains
I feel so tired from all these days
You make me feel so special
And so wasted
You make me feel anxiety rushin’ through my body
She only wants to hold me
Mondd el, mit számít a szó

Pull up, pull up, pull up, fight
Pull up, pull up, pull up, fight
Nem kell ide más csak egy...

Lesz itt majd ice on my neck, ja
Prada, Gucci bag, ja
Másfél hónap grind aztán a parkot töltjük meg
Mielőtt eltemetnek kell valami felejthetetlen
Ez nem egy one hit wonder flash
Mindenki annyit mond: „ez best”
Nem t'om, hogy mi van
Ja, lehet belebolondulok, lehet le is húznak
Százegy terv van hátra közben, mellettem elhúznak
Sokan mást várnak már, de hívogat az új
Csak gyеre velem, gyеre még!
'22 lesz az évünk

Everyone says: ""it's the best""

Many are already waiting for something else, but the new is calling
Just come with me, come again!

Nem tudja senki, hogy honnan jöttem
Hogy hányszor volt sötét az ég fölöttem
Ködös a múltam, nem ismeri senki
Nincs otthonom, nincs hova visszamenni
Sose voltam gazdag, de megvan minden
A legszebb pillanatok vannak ingyen
Sok fénylő szempár ragyog a világon
Millió lányé és én mindet imádom

Rohanok, hogy a nevem egy olvadó jéghegybe véssem
Félek, nem érem el
Életfogytig tart a vágy, de nincs aki féltsen
Mégsem érdekel

Azt mondják, hogy magasról lehet nagyot esni
Én ha elestem sem, álltam neki bűnbakot keresni
Néztem a szürke eget, azon tűnődtem, hogy lehet
Hogy ezer ágra süt a nap most is a felhők felett
Ha nyeregbe kerültem, mindig jött a pofon
Ez megtanított átlépni az üvegszilánkokon
Lehet a zsebemben teltház vagy csak lyukas garasok
Ez egy hullámvasút és én utas maradok

Sok fénylő szempár ragyog a világon
Millió lányé és én mindet imádom

Nem számolom, az élet rajtam hányszor ejtett sebet
A legnagyobb viharban sem kerestem rejtekhelyet
Mert a tettek helyett nem cselekednek a szavak
Inkább leszek nincstelen úgy, hogy mellette szabad
Minthogy olyan utat válasszak magamnak, ami másé
Semmim sincs, de mindenem egy útitársé
Nem nyom agyon a súly, pedig nem véletlen mondják
Hogy a batyumba csomagoltam a világ összes gondját
Egy vándor vagyok, nehezen megérthető
De nem mindig ég a ház, mikor az ég a tető
Csak sodródok az árral és pont mint egy folyó folyok
Nekem az is elég, ha egy csillag rám mosolyog

Nem tudja senki, hogy honnan jöttem
Hogy hányszor volt sötét az ég fölöttem
Ködös a múltam, nem ismeri senki
Nincs otthonom, nincs hova visszamenni
Sose voltam gazdag, de megvan minden
A legszebb pillanatok vannak ingyen
Sok fénylő szempár ragyog a világon
Millió lányé és én mindet imádom
Gondolatban párszor eldobtam már az evezőt
Amikor nem láttam magammal közös nevezőt
Van, hogy húz az ág s jól megtép a szél
De vihar előtt vörösen ég a kék
Úgyhogy tessék itt egy kabát, én magamnak már kötöttem
Remény volt a fonál, por- és cseppállóvá tettem
Hiszem minden nap, hogy ami tegnap ért
Egy kérdéssel felel a holnapért

Nem tudja senki, hogy honnan jöttem

Many pairs of shining eyes shine in the world
A million girls and I love them all

I rush to carve my name into a melting iceberg
I'm afraid I can't make it
The desire lasts a lifetime, but there is no one to fear
I don't care anyway

They say that you can fall from a great height
Even if I didn't fall, I stood looking for a scapegoat for him
I looked at the gray sky, wondering how it could be
That the sun still shines above the clouds for a thousand branches
When I got in the saddle, I always got slapped
It taught me how to step over shards of glass
I can have a full house in my pocket or only garages with holes
It's a roller coaster and I'll be a passenger
You might also like
No one knows where I came from
How many times the sky above me was dark
My past is hazy, no one knows it
I have no home, no place to go back to
I was never rich, but I have everything
The most beautiful moments are free
Many pairs of shining eyes shine in the world
A million girls and I love them all

I can't count how many times life has hurt me
I didn't look for a hiding place even in the biggest storm
Because words do not act instead of actions
I'd rather be penniless with him free
Like choosing a path for myself that belongs to someone else
I have nothing, but everything belongs to a traveling companion
The weight does not weigh on the brain, although they say it by chance
That I packed all the world's worries into my bag
I'm a wanderer, it's hard to understand
But the house doesn't always burn when the roof burns
I just drift with the tide and flow just like a river
A star smiling at me is enough for me

No one knows where I came from
How many times the sky above me was dark
My past is hazy, no one knows it
I have no home, no place to go back to
I was never rich, but I have everything
The most beautiful moments are free
Many pairs of shining eyes shine in the world
A million girls and I love them all
I've already dropped the oar a few times in my mind
When I didn't see a common denominator with myself
Sometimes the branch pulls and the wind tears it
But before a storm, blue burns red
So here's a coat, I've already knitted one for myself
The yarn was a hope, I made it dust and drop resistant
I believe every day that what happened yesterday
He answers with one question for tomorrow

No one knows where I came from
How many times the sky above me was dark
My past is hazy, no one knows it
I have no home, no place to go back to
I was never rich, but I have everything
The most beautiful moments are free

Ha még várnék ezeregy évig, hova mennél el?
Tudom, révbe értél rég, nekem marad a magány
Tudom, most is hallod a gondjaim, mégsem érzed át
De ha kicsit tisztul a szívem és a szíved, újra visszavársz

De mi a fasz?
Már ezer éve erre vártál, akkor mi aggaszt?
Most eskü, úgy csinálok mindent, hogy az nyomot hagy
És majd egy pillanatra teszem fel az életem
Az idő csak az egyetlen, ami kiakaszt
Icipici Azi túlságosan fiatal
Bár a testvéreim tudják jól, hogy mi a baj (Yuh)
Pár évig még tolom, aztán ég veled

Tudom lesz még rosszabb, de még jó
Mer' a zsebemben ott lapul a dinero
Igaz csak a felе, mer' a kezemеn a béklyó
Ne keseregj, kérlek!
Az, hogy nem állok ki magamért, az fixen hamis infó
Mire vágysz? (Yuh, mire vágysz?)
Nem is lényeg
'22 sem tisztább, mint bármely másik évem
És lehet kicsit részeges, lehet kicsit leszedált
De legalább egésznek érezheti magát
Vajon hova lett a flow, ami felemel a végén?
Egyszer itt hagy, aztán visszavár
Néha a 12 kopog, mert túl elevenen élünk
Kösz, jól vagyok, de kell a bíztatás, mer' ez más
(Dik)
Azt mondtad, hogy legyen fele-fele
Mondom egye fene, megindul a szerepcsere, áh
Testvérből ellenfelek
Nem para, nem szállok el míg kapom az átkot
De vá-vá-vá-vá-várj, amíg felérsz hozzám!

Még egy álom, mondd, mitől féljek?
Míg te rád várok, ne hagyj el kérlek!
Színpadon állok, hazatérek
De azt érzem, hogy megtalál a magány

Voltak rossz napok, magányos hajnalok
De csak ballagok tovább
Bárcsak hallanád, szívem dallamát
Érted írtam balladát
De hova sodor el a szél? Én mindent feláldozok
Ki tudja mivé leszek én, és miért lettem átkozott (Átkozott)

If I waited another thousand and one years, where would you go?
I know you've been gone for a long time, I'm left with loneliness
I know you can hear my problems, but you don't feel them
But when my heart and yours are a little bit cleaner, you will come back again

But what the hell?
You've been waiting for this for a thousand years, so why are you worried?
Now I swear, I do everything in a way that leaves a mark
And I'll put my life on hold for a moment
Time is the only thing that's holding me back
Little Azi is too young
Although my brothers know what's wrong (Yuh)
I'll push it for a few more years, then I'll burn with you

I know it gets worse, but it's still good
The dinero is hiding in my pocket
It's only half true, the shackles are on my hands
Don't complain, please!
The fact that I don't stand up for myself is definitely false information
What do you want? (Yuh, what do you want?)
It doesn't matter
'22 is no cleaner than any of my other years
And maybe a little drunk, maybe a little sober
But at least you can feel whole
Where did the flow that lifts me up at the end go?
Leave it here for once, then wait back
Sometimes 12 knocks because we live too vividly
Thanks, I'm fine, but I need encouragement, because this is different
(Dik)
You said it should be half and half
I say, what the hell, the role reversal begins, ah
Brothers and adversaries
It's okay, I won't leave until I get the curse
But wo-wo-wo-wo-wait until you get to me!

One more dream, tell me what should I be afraid of?
While I'm waiting for you, please don't leave me!
I'm on stage, I'm coming home
But I feel that loneliness has found me

There were bad days, lonely dawns
But I'm just rambling on
I wish you could hear the melody of my heart
I wrote a ballad for you
But where does the wind blow? I sacrifice everything
Who knows what I'll become and why I'm cursed (Cursed)
Tell me why, tell me why
Tell me, why am I cursed?

White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical

So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

I'm the bad guy

I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know

So you're a tough guy

I'm only good at bein' bad, bad

I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?

Várnék, rád várnék, ha tényleg bolond volnék
Hívj át, de nem látnak szívesen az apádék!
Hideg az ágy, olyan hideg lett a háznál
Rideg a szíved, de nem ridegebb a szádnál
Várnék, rád várnék, a szemem megint pulzál
Persze, de te sem leszel soha ilyen szép már
Hideg az ágy, olyan hideg lett a háznál
Rideg a szíved, de nem ridegebb a szádnál

Látom, hogy tele vannak apudék
Minek a sok pénz, ha egyfolytában sírhatnék?
Tegnap a barátaid erre jártak
Álltak közepén, a szövеgemre sírdogáltak
Néha van olyan, hogy szerеtnélek
Néha szeretem, hogy szorongsz, ahogy melléd lépek
Gyere, dobd fel, adok egy érmét!
Ha fejre esik, tetszel
Adok egy újat, bébi, nem érem be eggyel

Várnék, rád várnék, ha tényleg bolond volnék
Hívj át, de nem látnak szívesen az apádék!
Hideg az ágy, olyan hideg lett a háznál
Rideg a szíved, de nem ridegebb a szádnál
Várnék, rád várnék, a szemem megint pulzál
Persze, de te sem leszel soha ilyen szép már
Hideg az ágy, olyan hideg lett a háznál
Rideg a szíved, de nem ridegebb a szádnál

Lehet nem láttam én, de te jót tettél
Azzal, hogy nem hagytál engem élni, ah
Csak is én lennék, ha te nem lennél
Megin' elveszne minden, amiért élni olyan szép
Barátokból ellenség, találsz jobbat is, ne félj
Ha szomorú vagy, hát hazudd azt, hogy így minden egész!
De majd később felemészt
Ma nem teszem el a pénzt
Hisz benne ragadtam már abban a képben

Várnék, rád várnék, ha tényleg bolond volnék
Hívj át, de nem látnak szívesen az apádék!
Hideg az ágy, olyan hideg lett a háznál
Rideg a szíved, de nem ridegebb a szádnál

I would wait, I would wait for you, if I were really crazy
Call me over, but the fathers don't welcome you!
The bed is cold, it got so cold at home
Your heart is cold, but it is no colder than your mouth
I would wait, I would wait for you, my eyes are throbbing again
Of course, but you will never be this beautiful again
The bed is cold, it got so cold at home
Your heart is cold, but it is no colder than your mouth

I see that the apuds are full
What's the point of all the money if I could cry all the time?
Your friends went there yesterday
They stood in the middle, crying at my text
Sometimes I feel like I love you
Sometimes I like how you get anxious when I step next to you
Come on, toss it, I'll give you a coin!
If it falls on your head, you like it
I'll give you a new one, baby, I can't get enough of one

I would wait, I would wait for you, if I were really crazy
Call me over, but the fathers don't welcome you!
The bed is cold, it got so cold at home
Your heart is cold, but it is no colder than your mouth
I would wait, I would wait for you, my eyes are throbbing again
Of course, but you will never be this beautiful again
The bed is cold, it got so cold at home
Your heart is cold, but it is no colder than your mouth

Maybe I didn't see it, but you did a good job
By not letting me live, ah
I would only be me if it weren't for you
Everything that makes life so beautiful would be lost again
From friends to enemies, you can find better ones, don't be afraid
If you're sad, lie and say that everything is fine!
But it will eat you up later
I won't put the money away today
I think I'm already stuck in that picture

I would wait, I would wait for you, if I were really crazy
Call me over, but the fathers don't welcome you!
The bed is cold, it got so cold at home
Your heart is cold, but it is no colder than your mouth
I would wait, I would wait for you, my eyes are throbbing again
Of course, but you will never be this beautiful again
The bed is cold, it got so cold at home
Your heart is cold, but it is no colder than your mouth

Baby, you'll never be like that either
Accept it and love it like that…
Accept it and love it like that…
Love it so you never have to!3Embed",hu,"{'stood', 'time', 'middle', 'that…', 'friend', 'find', 'live', 'lost', 'call', 'colder', 'step', 'toss', 'full', 'fall', 'contributorsvárnék', 'text', 'head', 'job', 'youll', 'life', 'good', 'fine', 'father', 'course', 'away', 'crazy', 'mouth', 'later', 'anxious', 'either', 'cry', 'eat', 'today', 'cold', 'eye', 'lie', 'maybe', 'welcome', 'lyric', 'yesterday', 'love', 'werent', 'coin', 'new', 'enemy', 'money', 'went', 'apuds', 'wait', 'throbbing', 'beautiful', 'afraid', 'better', 'picture', 'sad', 'next', 'home', 'accept', 'heart', 'bed', 'letting', 'stuck', 'enough', 'point'}"

21,21,21,BSW,Mióta elhagytál,"3 ContributorsMióta elhagytál (Nem vagyok álmos) Lyrics
Mióta elhagytál, nem vagyok álmos
Csak járom az éjszakát

Ma kicsit meghalok, de kelek holnap
Eltelt ezer hónap, felriadok
Még mindig álmodok rólad
Álmodok rólad
És rád gondolok, nem tudom hol vagy
Nem hallok már rólad
Nem haragszom rád már, én remélem jól vagy
Én remélem jól vagy
És azt mutatom, hogy minden oké, oké
De mikor éjszaka senki se lát
Utamon a múlt követ, és én csak menekülök
Egyedül a városon át
És tudom nem szabadulok meg tőlünk
Túl sok a szép emlék
Egy kicsit nézlek még, és megöl ez az ébrenlét

Mióta elhagytál, nem vagyok álmos
Csak járom az éjszakát
Mióta nem vagy már, üres a város
Gondolok néha rád
Hazudok, hogy minden rendben
Pedig megfagyott, minden bennem
És nem bírom a súlyát, a pupillám túl tág
Amin bejön a sok emlékkép
Nemrég, még úgy volt minden
Mint egy filmben, óó és ez ketté tép!
Amin bejön a sok emlékkép
Nemrég, még úgy volt minden
Mint egy filmben, óó és ez ketté tép!

Mindig felriadok éjjel
Mindig álmodok rólunk, ahogy együtt vagyunk
Veszekedünk, lever a víz
És arra ébredek fel, hogy tiszta vizes az ágyam
Megint egyedül maradtam, meddig lesz ez még így?
De senki! Senki nem jött úgy, mint te
Senkit nem szerettem így, senki nem fogott így meg
És talán soha nem is fogok, és én ezt is elfogadom
Csak már nem akarom ezt, mert én nem bírom ezt
Azt hittem hogy már jól vagyok, kérdezem hol vagyok?
Hol vagyok, hol vagyok?
Mert csak visz ez a Bentley, ha nem figyelek pont
Amikor hazafele megyek, odakanyarodok
Kívülről nézem a házat, baszki miért vagyok itt?
Hát én már nem is itt lakom, én már elköltöztem rég
Úgy tűnik, nem fogtam fel
Talán itt ragadtál bent, és ide hoz el az éj
Hiába telt ezer év

Mióta elhagytál, nem vagyok álmos
Csak járom az éjszakát
Mióta nem vagy már, üres a város
Gondolok néha rád
Hazudok, hogy minden rendben
Pedig megfagyott, minden bennem
És nem bírom a súlyát, a pupillám túl tág
Amin bejön a sok emlékkép
Nemrég, még úgy volt minden
Mint egy filmben, óó és ez ketté tép!
Amín bejön a sok emlékkép
Nemrég, még úgy volt minden
Mint egy filmben, óó és ez ketté tép!Embed","3 ContributorsSince you left me (I'm not sleepy) Lyrics
I haven't been sleepy since you left me
I just walk the night

Today I die a little, but I will rise tomorrow
A thousand months have passed, I wake up
I still dream about you
I dream about you
And I think of you, I don't know where you are
I don't hear from you anymore
I'm not mad at you anymore, I hope you're well
I hope you are well
And I show that everything is okay, okay
But when no one sees at night
The past follows me on my way, and I just run away
Alone across town
And I know I won't get rid of us
Too many good memories
I look at you a little longer and this wakefulness kills me

I haven't been sleepy since you left me
I just walk the night
Since you're gone, the city is empty
I think about you sometimes
I lie that everything is fine
It's frozen, everything inside me
And I can't take its weight, my pupils are too wide
When the many memories come in
Not long ago, everything was like that
Like in a movie, oh and it rips in two!
When the many memories come in
Not long ago, everything was like that
Like in a movie, oh and it rips in two!

I always wake up at night
I always dream of us together
We fight, the water breaks
And I wake up to find that my bed is wet
I'm alone again, how long will it be like this?
But no one! Nobody came like you
I have never loved anyone like this, no one has held me like this
And maybe I never will, and I accept that
I just don't want this anymore because I can't stand it
I thought I was fine, I wonder where I am?
Where am I, where am I?
Because this Bentley just takes me if I'm not paying attention
When I go home, I turn there
I'm looking at the house from the outside, why the hell am I here?
Well, I don't even live here anymore, I moved a long time ago
I don't seem to have caught it
Maybe you're stuck inside and this is where the night brings you
A thousand years have passed in vain

I haven't been sleepy since you left me
I just walk the night
Since you're gone, the city is empty
I think about you sometimes
I lie that everything is fine
It's frozen, everything inside me
And I can't take its weight, my pupils are too wide
When the many memories come in
Not long ago, everything was like that
Like in a movie, oh and it rips in two!
Amen, the many memories come in
Not long ago, everything was like that
Like in a movie, oh and it rips in two!Embed",hu,"{'walk', 'looking', 'town', 'ago', 'fine', 'gone', 'away', 'outside', 'alone', 'run', 'memory', 'hope', 'seem', 'held', 'follows', 'across', 'accept', 'tomorrow', 'well', 'mad', 'stuck', 'vain', 'live', 'little', 'rip', 'good', 'water', 'amen', 'thousand', 'two', 'anyone', 'left', 'dream', 'lyric', 'hear', 'break', 'wonder', 'rise', 'thought', 'hell', 'bed', 'wet', 'night', 'house', 'passed', 'rid', 'lie', 'attention', 'stand', 'pupil', 'turn', 'since', 'home', 'paying', 'longer', 'together', 'kill', 'look', 'time', 'past', 'many', 'find', 'frozen', 'fight', 'show', 'loved', 'way', 'sleepy', 'weight', 'inside', 'long', 'today', 'bentley', 'wake', 'movie', 'month', 'maybe', 'moved', 'caught', 'die', 'year', 'wakefulness', 'brings', 'wide', 'empty', 'contributorssince', 'city'}"

Two trailer park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside
Two trailer park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside
(Woo!) (Ooh-ooh-ooh)

Guess who's back? Back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back? Guess who's back?
Guess who's back? Guess who's back?
Guess who's back? Guess who's back?
Guess who's back
I've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to
See Marshall no more; they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (Hey!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me, so
Come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits, and get ready
'Cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, fuck you, Debbie!

'Cause it feels so empty without me

Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners, helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch!""
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, polluting the airwaves, a rebel
So just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass—you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, da-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in, and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter, I'm interesting
The best thing since wrestling, infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, ""Attention, please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents; my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me

Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You thirty-six-year-old bald-headed fag, blow me
You don't know me; you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene (Yeah)
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do Black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey!)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me
Now this looks like a job for me

Most már mindent elfelejtettem, nem akarok semmit
Már úgy kelek fel minden reggel, hogy semmi se rendít meg
Te csak állsz ott, nem is nézel, ah
Megvagy már, yuh, többé nem mész el
És már csak azon gondolkodok, végre mikor kelek fel
Hogy csalódottan jöjjek rá, még mindig szeretlek
Vagy ez egy másik dimenzió és már rég eltemettek?
De akkor miért ég a tűz még mindig a szemedben?
Már nem is látom, hogy honnan is kezdtem
A számba nem rágod, hogy kiből kivé lettem
Hát állj meg, nézz hátra, mi nem vagyunk szentek!
De lehetünk még kettőből egyek

Nem kell ide más (Yuh)
Ülök a fűben és csak várom a csodát, yuh
Szürkébb az ég is mikor nem gondolok rád
Tudod nagyon jól a végét, de te úgyis belemész, yuh
Belemész

Te a tűz, én a jég, de csak veled lehetnék
Nekem nem kéne senki más
Kezem a kezedhez ért, hiába nem vagy enyém
Nem látom a szürke fát (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
De hogyha valami volt és valaki téged bántott
Én mindig ott álltam melletted, engem semmi se gátolt
Keresnél, nem felednél, de nem tudod merre táncolsz
Hol vagy már? A szívem csak érted lángol

Ó-ó, üres a ház, nem látom a határt
Hiszem én, hogy hazatalál

Szürkébb az ég is mikor nem gondolok rád

Szeretnél, nem szeretnél, megyek már, de maradnék
Bennem maradt ez a kép, mikor minden olyan szép
Feledném, elfeledném, komoly voltam, nevettél
Itt már nincsen menedék, itt már nincsen menedék, yuh
Ő neki más jelent az igazából szerelem
De bennem van, hogy egyszer úgyis majd elfeledem
Néha úgy érzem, tényleg elvette az eszemet
De bennem van, hogy egyszer úgyis majd elfeledem

Now I've forgotten everything, I don't want anything
I already wake up every morning without anything shaking me
You just stand there, not even looking, ah
You're done, yuh, you're not leaving anymore
And I'm just thinking about when I'll finally get up
To be disappointed, I still love you
Or is it another dimension and long buried?
But then why is the fire still burning in your eyes?
I can't even see where I started
You don't know who I've become
Well stop, look back, we are not saints!
But we can still be one of two

You don't need anyone else here (Yuh)
I'm sitting in the grass and just waiting for a miracle, yuh
The sky is grayer when I don't think about you
You know the ending very well, but you go with it anyway, yuh
You go in

You are the fire, I am the ice, but I could only be with you
I don't need anyone else
My hand reached your hand, even though you are not mine
I can't see the gray tree (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
But if something happened and someone hurt you
I was always there for you, nothing stopped me
You would search, you wouldn't forget, but you don't know where you are dancing
where are you already My heart only burns for you

Oh-oh, the house is empty, I can't see the border
I believe he will find his way home
To find home, to find you home

You don't need anything else here
I'm sitting in the grass and just waiting for a miracle, yuh
The sky is grayer when I don't think about you
You know the ending very well, but you go with it anyway
You go in

You want it, you don't want it, I'm going, but I would stay
This image stayed with me, when everything was so beautiful
I would forget, I would forget, I was serious, you laughed
There's no shelter here, there's no shelter here, yuh
Love really means something different to him
But I have a feeling that one day I will forget it anyway
Sometimes I feel like he really took my mind off me
But I have a feeling that one day I will forget it anyway

Oh, oh, oh, I don't need anything else
Oh, oh, oh, I don't need anything else
You don't need anything else here
I'm sitting in the grass and just waiting for a miracle, yuh
The sky is grayer when I don't think about you
You know the ending very well, but you go with it anyway
You go in

You don't need anything else here
I sit in the grass and just wait for a miracle
The sky is grayer when I don't think about you
You know the ending very well, but you go with it anyway, yuh

Szomorú éjszakák után örömteli a reggel
Szemhéj csukódik, pupilla tág
Fel a fejjel Magyarország: Guten Tag!
Élvezd, amíg van még mit, mintha ez a perc lenne az utolsó
Nem attól haladsz előre, ha össze-vissza futkosol
Palota vagy piszkos ól
Az biztos: minden úr szereti a nőket
Hát szeress te is Biztos Úr!
Tiszta sor: Az élet téged igazol
Senki nem bánt, ha járod utad öröm-ittasul
Élvezd, hogyha rád tör a lámpaláz
Semmi sem bonyolult annyira, hogy ráparázz
Nyáron-télen a népem szolgálom és védem
Neked én vagyok, nekem te vagy a testvérem
Élvezd, még ha fáj is minden egyes frázis
A külvilág csak színfalak, szívedben a bázis
Nem kérlek légy enyém örökké, mégis hozzád szól dalom
Úgysem élhetünk örökké, egy percig lennék oltalom
Nem kérlek légy enyém örökké, mégis hozzád szól dalom
Úgysem élhetünk örökké, egy percig lennék oltalom
Élvezd...
Ha nekem jó, jó neked...
Ha üres a fejed lesz mivel megtöltened
Élvezd...
Ha nap süti szemedet
Mindegy a szereped
A lényeg a szeretet
Élvezd...
Hogy minden rosszban van valami
Ha egymagad maradsz is lehetsz még valaki
Élvezd...
Ha újnak látszik, ami maradi
De ne gondolkodd túl a dolgokat, mert maradsz wanna be

Hisz ugyanúgy mindenki téveszt
Tapasztalatod majd később pont ezért lesz
Ne vedd magad komolyan, okosítás hiába van
Az én világomban vakot vezet a világtalan
Élvezd...
Hogyha rontottál tanulhatsz belőle
Ilyenkor nincs más hátra, mint előre
A rosszat jó követ, nem lesz folyton nehézség
Nem baj, ha nem sportolsz, lehet fél egészség
Élvezd az életnek minden egyes percét
Megérdemled az időt, hogy tartalmasan teljék
Élvezd a napsütést, hogy éppen nem esik
Élvezd a munkát, tudod, hogy az nemesít
Élvezd, hogy valamihez tisztán jutsz hozzá
Így nem kell aggódnod, hogy jön a jakobinus-puttonyszáj
Ha beborul az ég, és jön a jégeső
Mosolyogva dobjál be te is velünk egy jäger-sört
Nem kérlek légy enyém örökké, mégis hozzád szól dalom
Úgysem élhetünk örökké, egy percig lennék oltalom

After sad nights, the morning is joyful
Eyelid closes, pupil wide
Head up Hungary: Guten Tag!
Enjoy it while you still have it, as if this minute were your last
Running back and forth doesn't make you progress
A palace or a dirty shack
It is certain: all men love women
I love you too Mr. Bizto!
A clean line: Life validates you
No one cares if you go your way drunk with joy
Enjoy when you get lamp fever
Nothing is so complicated that you'll burn yourself out
I serve and protect my people in summer and winter
To you I am, to me you are my brother
Enjoy it, even if every phrase hurts
The outside world is just a stage, your heart is the base
I'm not asking you to be mine forever, but my song is for you
We can't live forever anyway, I would be your protection for a minute
I'm not asking you to be mine forever, but my song is for you
We can't live forever anyway, I would be your protection for a minute
Enjoy...
If it's good for me, it's good for you...
If your head is empty, what will you fill it with?
Enjoy...
If the sun bakes your eyes
It doesn't matter what your role is
The point is love
Enjoy...
That there is something wrong with everything
Even if you stay alone, you can be someone else
Enjoy...
If it looks new, what stays
But don't overthink things, because you'll remain a wannabe

After all, everyone makes mistakes
That's exactly why you'll have experience later
Don't take yourself seriously, there is no point in reasoning
In my world, the blind lead the unworldly
Enjoy...
If you screw up, you can learn from it
In such cases, there is nothing left but forward
Bad is followed by good, there will not be constant difficulties
It's okay if you don't exercise, you can be half healthy
Enjoy every minute of life
You deserve the time to spend it meaningfully
Enjoy the sunshine that it's not raining
Enjoy the work, you know it ennobles you
Enjoy getting to something clean
That way, you don't have to worry about the Jacobin-putton mouth coming
When the sky darkens and the hail comes
Throw in a jäger beer with us with a smile
I'm not asking you to be mine forever, but my song is for you
We can't live forever anyway, I would be your protection for a minute
I'm not asking you to be mine forever, but my song is for you
We can't live forever anyway, I would be your protection for a minute

A club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go (Mm)
Me and my friends at the table doin' shots
Drinkin' fast and then we talk slow (Mm)
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I'll give it a chance now (Mm)
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance and now I'm singin' like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, ""Boy, let's not talk too much""
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is fallin' too
I'm in love with your body

And now my bed sheets smell like you

And how your family is doin' okay (Mm)

Tell the driver make the radio play and I'm singin' like

Memento
Ó, ba-ba-barátom
Sajnálom, hogy nem voltam jó hozzád

Azt mondom, éjjel a macskaköves utakon
Megláttam egy mulatozó csapatot
És eltűnődtem azon milyen régen is volt
Hogy úgy éreztem magam, mint egy gyerek, gyere, gyere!
Gyerekkorom belepi a beton
Hisz egy palotai nem vár már csodát
Csak egyedül bandukol az utakon
Amíg nem ütött az utolsó óránk (Viszlát)

Sohase várhatna eleget, hát ő újra eltemet
Százegy rossz emléket kiskorából
Arcára ragad az a kép, ahogy szeretné, hogy lásd
De valójában soha, soha nem jön vissza már

Minden éjjel meg reggelente megváltoznék
Megfogadom, a kezembe veszem a kontrollt, amire várt már rég
Ne haragudj, hogyha kicsikét faramuci vagyok, de mit árthatnék?
Nektek, ha nem is írok, nem is veszem fel, ha hívtok
Nem értem, mit sírtok
Nekem is ki van a faszom attól, hogy be vagyok zárva
(És chilis Sobát zabálok a szobában)
Áh, körbeveszem magam fallal, hogy magamat elszeparáljam
Hidd el, én nem ezt kértem, hogy így legyen vége
A gödör is mély
Csalogatna, de baba, de te ne félj!
Látom az alagút végén, az alagút végén
A fényt, amit elloptok, nem vagyok ma toppon
Mert krízisben az egzisztenciám
Csak annyit mondj, hogy „Jól vagy, nem kell félni
Próbáljunk meg élni!”
Hisz mind ez csupán apróság a nagyvilágban
Hisz az, ami szép volt az csak ami rég volt
Az csak ez a szóban forgó bánat
Utolér a téboly és minden rémálmom
Amikor már megpihennék úgy, de ő

Sohasem fáradna eleget, hát ő újra betemet
Minden régi gyötrelmet meg bánatot
De te ne aggódj értem, kérlek, nekem így is nagyon jó!
Csak gondolj rám, ha soha többé nem kelek fel már!


Minden éjjel meg reggelente megváltoznék
De minden éjjel meg reggelente bezárkóznék
Minden éjjel meg reggelente meg-v-v-v-v-változnék
Minden éjjel meg reggelente bezárr—Embed","3 ContributorsIntroverted song Lyrics

He remembered
Oh ba-ba-my friend
I'm sorry I wasn't good to you

I say at night on the cobblestone roads
I saw a group having fun
And I wondered how long ago it was
How I felt like a child, come, come!
When I was a child, I was addicted to concrete
After all, a palace doesn't expect miracles anymore
He just hangs out on the roads alone
Until our last hour struck (Goodbye)

He could never wait long enough, so he buried her again
One hundred and one bad memories from childhood
The image he wants you to see is stuck on his face
But really, he's never, ever coming back

I would change every night and morning
I promise, I'll take the control you've been waiting for for a long time
I'm sorry if I'm being a bit of a curmudgeon, but what harm could I do?
For you, if I don't write, I won't answer your call
I don't understand why you are crying
I'm sick of being locked up too
(And I'm eating chili Soba in the room)
Ah, I surround myself with a wall to separate myself
Trust me, I didn't ask for it to end this way
The pit is also deep
It would tempt you, baby, but don't be afraid!
I see it at the end of the tunnel, at the end of the tunnel
The light you steal, I'm not in the mood today
Because my existence is in crisis
Just say, “You're fine, don't worry
Let's try to live!”
All this is just a small thing in the big world
I think that what was beautiful is only what was a long time ago
That's just the grief in question
Madness overtakes me and all my nightmares
When I should rest like that, but he
You might also like
He would never get tired enough, so he buried him again
All the old pain and sorrow
But don't worry about me, please, I'm still very good!
Just think of me if I never get up again!


I would change every night and morning
But I would lock myself in every night and morning
Every night and in the morning I would-v-v-v-v-change
It closes every night and in the morning—Embed",hu,"{'hour', '“youre', 'old', 'answer', 'concrete', 'ago', 'sorry', 'song', 'fine', 'remembered', 'wall', 'felt', 'wouldvvvvchange', 'sick', 'alone', 'curmudgeon', 'tunnel', 'memory', 'promise', 'wondered', 'nightmare', 'group', 'goodbye', 'buried', 'deep', 'question', 'stuck', 'control', 'call', 'mood', 'image', 'morning—', 'last', 'waiting', 'good', 'steal', 'worry', 'overtakes', 'small', 'write', 'surround', 'crisis', 'close', 'lyric', 'locked', 'road', 'child', 'bit', 'wait', 'existence', 'back', 'saw', 'sorrow', 'ask', 'addicted', 'harm', 'morning', 'trust', 'pain', 'tempt', 'contributorsintroverted', 'friend', 'light', 'hang', 'please', 'world', 'night', 'chili', 'end', 'fun', 'struck', 'miracle', 'madness', 'thing', 'change', 'lock', 'eating', 'understand', 'beautiful', 'afraid', 'expect', 'try', 'rest', 'big', 'time', 'soba', 'way', 'babamy', 'bad', 'grief', 'live”', 'childhood', 'room', 'long', 'pit', 'cry', 'today', 'face', 'wasnt', 'cobblestone', 'tired', 'palace', 'hundred', 'separate', 'enough'}"

If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would pop champagne and raise a toast
To all of the queens who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancing on your own

Can't live without me, you wanna, but you can't, nah-nah-nah
Think it's funny, but honey, can't run this show on your own
I can feel my body shake, there's only so much I can take
I'll show you how a real queen behaves (Oh)

No damsel in distress, don't need to save me
Once I start breathin' fire, you can't tame me
And you might think I'm weak without a sword
But if I had one, it'd be bigger than yours

If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would pop champagne and raise a toast
To all of the queens who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancing on your own

Disobey me, then baby, it's off with your head
Gonna change it and make it a world you won't forget (Oh)

You get too close, you'll get a royalty high
So breathe it in to feel alive

Nézd az a csaj, világít a szemében az abszint
Ma is reggel hív taxit
De én nem tartok vele, hogyha hív sem
Úgyse érdekel már egyik szív sem
Valamikor régen tudtam, hogy ki vagyok
Most meg azt tudom, hogy mindig kivagyok
Érzem, hogy változni kéne
De csak merülök lejjebb a mélybe
Aztán mikor látom a mosolyod az utcán
Jössz velem szemben tudom, odabújnál
Én is mosolyognék oda tényleg
De hidd el, csak magamtól félek
Mi lesz, ha rosszul ébredek reggel?
Mi lesz, ha rájössz, hogy ez neked nem kell?
Engеm itthon mindenki ismer
Pedig tеtszik a mosolyod

Emlékszem rád egy fesztiválról
Vagy faszt
A fröccsteraszról
Te voltál, aki táncolt velem
Fenn volt a Nap
Vagy faszt
Most úgy emlékszem
Lehet késő éjjel te voltál, aki ott volt velem

Nekem mindegy, hogy este vagy délben
Egyre ritkábban vagyok képben
Tessék, itt vagyok nesze, csak vedd el
De szerintem ez neked nem kell
És hogyha szeretnéd tudni az igazat
A tegnapi napunk is úgy-ahogy kimaradt
Értsd meg, velem csak időt vesztegetsz
Jobb, hogyha tisztán látod a helyzetet
Aztán mikor látom a mosolyod az utcán
Jössz velem szemben tudom, odabújnál
Én is mosolyognék oda tényleg
De hidd el, csak magamtól félek
Mi lesz, ha rosszul ébredek reggel?
Mi lesz, ha rájössz, hogy ez neked nem kell?
Pedig hidd el, nekem is tetszel
És tetszik a mosolyod

Emlékszem rád egy fesztiválról
Vagy faszt
A fröccsteraszról
Te voltál, aki táncolt velem
Fenn volt a Nap
Vagy faszt
Most úgy emlékszem
Lehet késő éjjel te voltál, aki ott volt velem

Look at that girl, the absinthe is shining in her eyes
He calls a taxi this morning too
But I don't keep up with him, even if he calls
I don't care about any hearts anymore
Once upon a time, I knew who I was
Now I know that I'm always out
I feel that I should change
But I'm just diving deeper
Then when I see your smile on the street
Come in front of me, I know, you'd hide
I would really smile there too
But believe me, I'm only afraid of myself
What if I wake up feeling sick in the morning?
What if you realize you don't need it?
Everyone at home knows me
I like your smile though

I remember you from a festival
Or a dick
About the splash terrace
You were the one who danced with me
The sun was up
Or a dick
I remember now
Maybe it was you who was there with me late at night
You might also like
I don't care if it's night or noon
I'm in the picture less and less
Here, I'm here, just take it
But I don't think you need that
And if you want to know the truth
Our day yesterday was also missed
Understand, you're just wasting my time
You better see the situation clearly
Then when I see your smile on the street
Come in front of me, I know, you'd hide
I would really smile there too
But believe me, I'm only afraid of myself
What if I wake up feeling sick in the morning?
What if you realize you don't need it?
Believe me, I like you too
And I like your smile

I remember you from a festival
Or a dick
About the splash terrace
You were the one who danced with me
The sun was up
Or a dick
I remember now
Maybe it was you who was there with me late at night
I remember you from a festival
Or a dick
About the splash terrace
You were the one who danced with me
The sun was up
Or a dick
I remember now
Maybe it was you who was there with me late at night

I remember you
I remember you

39,39,39,Ekhoe,Costa Rica,"9 ContributorsCosta Rica Lyrics
Designer, Dior-Dior, megcsillan a szeme a pesti lánynak
Kérdezi, hogy mi volt-mi volt? Szívemben is titkokat lesni járnak
Mikor a csajszik alapoznak, a fiaim a studiban rég piálnak
Szívunk egy valamit, a tabik elhitetik, hogy baby várlak

Koszos lett a pogo-ba az AirForce, egyszer behódítom Costa Ricat
Tegnap éjjel a te csajod is megvolt, tudta már az összes ottani lány
Minta gyerek vagyok, veled csak egy gond, a spanod falumba osztani jár
Kifosztod az OTP-t meg a  vegyesboltot, de nem tudsz beoltani már

Az Ekhoe egy premium gyerek, stúdióba tabi és hiteket pakolok papapa kész
Van aki belеszületik és van akit húznak a spanjai, anyuka néz
Füstöl a kégli, mert Szalai hegyi patak tisztán énеkli a magas C-t
OTL család az oppok meg sírnak mert látják, hogy folyamat halad a cég
Seba hozza a Passatot, szar cigiket teker a rasztátok
Gyuris nem lát ki a kasszából, hogyha nem hiszitek akkor basszátok meg
Várj baby, easy-easy, a lányoknak adom az életem is
Csár szag van, érzi-érzi, egy hétig elélek a mérgeken is
OTL akva, parkolóba Supra gumija ég
'Rari a cityben, munkásautó, leszarom ha utálsz, új vagyok még
Mi ez az ország akkorát megyünk, hogy egy hónap múlva, ránk szakad az ég
Tömegben Fiji ez nemzeti kincs, én tűzön át megyek az aranyakért
Kicsi Ekhoe nagyot játszik, orosz rulett nagyok a tétek és remeg a lány
Supreme a naci, a póló Academy pénzem is alig van de legalább
Remeg a lánc a nyakamba, gyémánt a szemem, egy vaku és villanok rád
KInőttem a játékaidat baby, lőtték a pizsit és irány az ágy

Designer, Dior-Dior, the eyes of the girl from Pest sparkle
You ask what happened? They also come to look for secrets in my heart
When the girls are building foundations, my sons are drinking for a long time in the studio
We suck something, the tabs make you believe that I'm expecting a baby

AirForce got dirty in the pogo, I'll conquer Costa Rica one day
Your girl was there last night, all the girls there already knew
I'm a model child, there's only one problem with you, you have to divide your span into my village
You loot the OTP and the general store, but you can no longer vaccinate

Ekhoe is a premium kid, I'm ready for the studio and I'm packing hits
Some are born into it and some are pulled by their spanks, mom watches
The chimney is smoking, because the Szalai mountain stream sings the high C clearly
OTL family, the OPs are crying because they see that the company is progressing
Seba brings the Passat, your dreadlocks roll shitty cigarettes
Gyuris can't see from the box office that if you don't believe me, fuck me
Wait baby, easy-easy, I give my life to the girls too
There's a foul smell, you can feel it, I can smell it for a week, even on poisons
OTL aqua, Supra's tires burn in the parking lot
'Rari in the city, working car, I'll fuck you if you hate me, I'm still new
We, this country, are going so far that in a month, the sky will fall on us
In general, Fiji is a national treasure, I will go through fire for the gold
Little Ekhoe plays big, Russian roulette, the stakes are high and the girl is shaking
Supreme is the Nazi, I hardly have money for the Academy t-shirt, but at least
The chain around my neck trembles, my eyes are diamonds, a flash and I flash at you
I've outgrown your toys baby, shot the piz and off to bed

41,41,41,Manuel,Zombi,"1 ContributorDump die junk! LyricsHier is een raadsel
Het is vaak een dief of straatdel
Het heeft een hoofd met zaagsel
En kleren met braaksel
Geen kies meer om te kauwen
Je kan ze niet vertrouwen
En je kan niet om ze rouwen
Als ze sterven in de koude
Ze stinken als een skunk
En zien er uit als een punk
Het is een vuile vieze gore teringjunk
Overal kom je die zielepieten tegen
Ze liggen uitgemergeld te beven in de regen
Hun haren die kleven
En hun enige reden om te leven
Is om er na te streven
Zichzelf een shot te geven
Dump die junk want het is hun eigen schuld
Stinkend rijke dealers die ()lachen zich een bult
Want zeg nou zelf
Ze begonnen ooit zelf
Ze kopen het zelf
Ze roken het zelf
Ze spuiten ook zelf
En ze snuiven ook zelf
Ze stelen steeds zelf
En verspreiden aids zelf
Ze verloren zichzelf
Dus vermoorden zichzelf
Ze doen het godverdomme toch allemaal zelf
You might also likeDus een ding wat ik niet heb is medelijden
Je kan niet eens normaal meer met de metro rijden
Dan zit er weer zo'n sukkel te stinken z'n rotzooi
Als ze niet zo vies waren gaf je ze een rotgooi
Lege holle ogen kijken wel maar zien niets
En zodra de (coke/dope) uitwerkt jatten ze je fiets
Zit er zo'n verslaafde tussen de beschaafde
Mensen, ga je wensen dat die zombie z'n laatste
Trip maakt en voordat ie weer een huis kraakt
Stik doordat ie op z'n rug ligt en braakt
Ouders zeggen dat een drugsdealer maar gemeen is
Maar ze weten niet dat hun eigen zoon er een is
Je bent tegen drugs trut, lik m'n penis
Niet de drug maar de gebruiker is wat het probleem is
Want zonder de gebruikers ook geen illegaal handel
Geen mafia, geen gangsters en geen dealers aan de wandel
Maar door die junks zegt (een dopeman) ""Waarom niet?
Ik heb geld en macht en neuk elke griet.""
Maar wacht maar af, want eenmaal zal je niet lachen
En zal de concurrent bij je binnenkomen raggen
Of door een hinderlaag grijpt de smeris je in je kraag
En in de bajes wordt je reet ontmaagd
En als je weer vrij komt kun je nergens belanden
Want degene die je ... waren zijn nu vijanden
Je mooie boot
Werd gekraakt als een noot
En iemand schoot
Je makkers dood
Met lood
In hun boot
Zodat ze als een idioot
Stierven in hun blote kloot
In een goot
In een grote sloot
Van bloedrood
Teringjunk, in plaats van de straat af te likken
Moeten jullie allemaal verplicht afkicken
En als je dat weigert dan is dat fijn
Dan kicken wij je af, van de rand van een ravijn
Want jullie karakter is jullie zwakte
Vroeger deed je stoer totdat je drugs pakte
Je gebruikte steeds meer en voelde je te gek
Maar nu gebruikt de drugs jou en je prikt je aders lek
De naalden gaan van de ene arm in de andere
Wanneer gaat dit nou godverdomme eens veranderen
Als het aan mij ligt nu meteen
Een methadonbus met een gratis overdosis voor iedereen
En voor alle junks die nog kunnen nadenken
En zich afvragen of er nou hoop is
Yo Seda, schop die beat d'r in en laat ze horen wat jouw dope is!Embed","1 ContributorDump that junk! LyricsHere's a riddle
It is often a thief or street thief
It has a sawdust head
And clothes with vomit
No more tooth to chew
You can't trust them
And you can't mourn them
When they die in the cold
They stink like a skunk
And look like a punk
It's a dirty filthy filthy junk
You see those souls everywhere
They lie emaciated, trembling in the rain
Their hair that sticks
And their only reason to live
Is to pursue it
To give himself a shot
Dump that junk because it's their fault
Filthy rich dealers who () laugh like crazy
Because tell yourself
They once started themselves
They buy it themselves
They smoke it themselves
They also spray themselves
And they also sniff themselves
They keep stealing themselves
And spread AIDS itself
They lost themselves
So kill themselves
They do it all goddamn themselves anyway
You might also likeSo one thing I don't have is pity
You can't even ride the subway normally anymore
Then there's another sucker stinking his mess
If they weren't so dirty, you'd give them a shit
Empty hollow eyes look but see nothing
And as soon as the (coke/dope) wears off, they steal your bike
Is there such an addict among the civilized
Folks, are you going to wish that zombie his last
Trip makes and before he squats another house
Choke because he lays on his back and vomits
Parents say a drug dealer is mean
But they don't know that their own son is one
You anti drugs bitch, lick my penis
Not the drug but the user is what the problem is
Because without the users there would be no illegal trade
No mafia, no gangsters and no dealers walking around
But through them junkies says (a dope man) ""Why not?
I've got money and power and I'll fuck any chick.""
But just wait, because once you won't laugh
And will the competitor come to you ragging
Or through an ambush the cop grabs you by the collar
And in prison your ass will be deflowered
And when you get out again, you can't end up anywhere
For the ones you were... are now enemies
Your beautiful boat
Was cracked like a nut
And someone shot
Your buddies dead
With lead
In their boat
So she like an idiot
Died in their bare asses
In a gutter
In a big ditch
Of blood red
Teringjunk, instead of licking the street
Do you all have to go through rehab?
And if you refuse, that's fine
Then we kick you off the edge of a ravine
For your character is your weakness
You used to act tough until you took drugs
You used more and more and felt great
But now the drugs are using you and you're puncturing your veins
The needles pass from one arm to the other
When the hell is this going to change
If it's up to me right now
A methadone canister with a free overdose for everyone
And for all the junkies who can still think
And wonder if there is any hope

Call us guys and we'll start at night
At 10 o'clock in the bar, it's important not to be late
I like my whiskey over a little ice

I don't know where the goal is yet
And the wind keeps working against me
But it doesn't blow back, my skin is made of armor
And my heart is steel
No matter how bumpy the road is
I'm going, no matter the distance
I just muster up the courage to do it
And I take the tent pole
There will be no more messages

My companion is loneliness, my lover is hope
I would try my luck
But bad luck is in love with me
My heart is the engine, hell wait
I'm just saying it's a little late
Where life has taken me
I'll let you know when I get back
There will be no more messages
I leave everything here
I'll go while I have the strength
I set up camp there
Where my footprint
The rain will wash it away
I have made so many mistakes
Like a star in the sky
But as long as the fire still rages inside me
I'll let it burn
I will go and where no one can see

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all

Yeah, yeah, listen, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay

I told you, but you didn't believe me
You really did nothing
They didn't see how much shit I went through
No problem, I finally have money

There was hardly any
Annó, who believed in me, but seriously
I ran in, but they don't understand how
Still, many people congratulate me
The difference between them and me, (is)
That I won on my own, (yeah)
Did my face really get big? No thanks
Rather, the road I came from is big
The juice is pouring, the juice is pouring, the juice is pouring, (yea, yea)
We fly, up, up, (yea, yea)
The headwind gives strength
No one helped, no one talks about it (no one talks about it)
Tell me they knew (aha)
The door was closed in front of me (aha)
The stars lied (aha)
They talk, but they are lazy
They keep pulling my brain
Because they are bored with their own lives
Hate looks good on you
I'm wearing fur coats
You might also like
I told you, but you didn't believe me
You really did nothing
They didn't see how much shit I went through
No problem, I finally have money
I told you, but you didn't believe me
You really did nothing
They didn't see how much shit I went through
No problem, I finally have money

I did ""Oh, waow""
Listen, my hair looks good too
There's a person around every corner
The one who tries to pull you down
My eyes are always on the field
I fly on the wing of the free
I got here as an orphan
I didn't hold onto anyone's shoulders
So many mouths, so many words, so much shit (oh no)
How many summers, how many shows, how many songs (oh yeah)
Everything is good now, but I don't know how long it will last
So I enjoy it while I can and pour a drink
I feel like I deserve this much (and)
I didn't get anything from anyone (ever)
I have come thousands of kilometers so that
I progressed one centimeter every day
Sorry, I don't flex instantly (no)
Although I took it a lot (yeah)
1 month, 1 million net
I'm not here
I told you, but you didn't believe me
You really did nothing
They didn't see how much shit I went through
No problem, I finally have money
I told you, but you didn't believe me
You really did nothing
They didn't see how much shit I went through
No problem, I finally have money2Embed",hu,"{'anyones', 'lied', 'sorry', 'song', 'deserve', 'aha', 'pulling', 'front', 'listen', 'annó', 'hair', 'seriously', 'person', 'thanks', 'wing', 'door', 'summer', 'shoulder', 'rather', 'lazy', 'believe', 'hold', 'shit', 'last', 'good', 'keep', 'thousand', 'anyone', 'pouring', 'eye', 'bored', 'lyric', 'flex', 'instantly', 'road', 'hardly', 'went', 'enjoy', 'yea', 'contributori', 'finally', 'centimeter', 'million', 'star', 'kilometer', 'believed', 'waow', 'brain', 'closed', 'corner', 'headwind', 'strength', 'around', 'pour', 'field', 'net', 'fly', 'progressed', 'helped', 'understand', 'people', 'try', 'difference', 'big', 'look', 'took', 'many', 'problem', 'show', 'hate', 'orphan', 'life', 'word', 'ran', 'talk', 'drink', 'onto', 'mouth', 'long', 'juice', 'wearing', 'face', 'month', 'lot', 'money', 'although', 'told', 'pull', 'free', 'fur', 'coat', 'congratulate'}"

(D-D-Daytrip took it to ten, hey)
Baby back, ayy, couple racks, ayy
Couple Grammys on him, couple plaques, ayy
That's a fact, ayy, throw it back, ayy
Throw it back, ayy
And this one is for the champions
I ain't lost since I began, yeah
Funny how you said it was the end, yeah
Then I went did it again, yeah

I told you long ago on the road
I got what they waiting for
I don't run from nothing, dog
Get your soldiers, tell 'em I ain't layin' low
You was never really rooting for me anyway
When I'm back up at the top, I wanna hear you say
He don't run from nothin', dog
Get your soldiers, tell 'em that the break is over

Uh, need to, uh
Need to get this album done
Need a couple number onеs
Need a plaque on every song
Need mе like one with Nicki now
Tell a rap nigga I don't see ya, hah
I'm a pop nigga like Bieber, hah
I don't fuck bitches, I'm queer, hah
But these niggas bitches like Madea, yeah, yeah, yeah, ayy (Yeah)
Oh, let's do it
I ain't fall off, I just ain't release my new shit
I blew up, now everybody tryna sue me
You call me Nas, but the hood call me Doobie, yeah
You might also like
And this one is for the champions
I ain't lost since I began, yeah
Funny how you said it was the end, yeah
Then I went did it again, yeah

I told you long ago on the road
I got what they waiting for (I got what they're waiting for)
I don't run from nothing, dog
Get your soldiers, tell 'em I ain't layin' low (Bitch, I ain't runnin' from nowhere)
You was never really rooting for me anyway (Ooh, ooh)
When I'm back up at the top, I wanna hear you say (Ooh, ooh)
He don't run from nothin', dog
Get your soldiers, tell 'em that the break is over (Yeah)

My track record so clean, they couldn't wait to just bash me
I must be gettin' too flashy, y'all shouldn't have let the world gas me (Woo)
It's too late 'cause I'm here to stay and these girls know that I'm nasty (Mmm)
I sent her back to her boyfriend with my handprint on her ass cheek
City talkin', we takin' notes
Tell 'em all to keep makin' posts
Wish he could, but he can't get close
OG so proud of me that he chokin' up while he makin' toasts
I'm the type that you can't control, said I would, then I made it so
I don't clear up rumors (Ayy), where's y'all sense of humor? (Ayy)
I'm done makin' jokes 'cause they got old like baby boomers
Turned my haters to consumers, I make vets feel like they juniors (Juniors)
Say your time is comin' soon, but just like Oklahoma (Mmm)
Mine is comin' sooner (Mmm), I'm just a late bloomer (Mmm)
I didn't peak in high school, I'm still out here gettin' cuter (Woo)
All these social networks and computers
Got these pussies walkin' 'round like they ain't losers
I told you long ago on the road
I got what they waiting for (I got what they waiting for)
I don't run from nothing, dog
Get your soldiers, tell 'em I ain't layin' low (Bitch, I ain't runnin' from nowhere)
You was never really rooting for me anyway

52,52,52,Tóth Andi,Néztek,"2 ContributorsNéztek LyricsNéztek, néztek, néztek
Nézitek, hogy hol vagyok, hogy mit csinálok
Írogatsz, hogy szar vagyok, kis aranyásó
Nem kedvel az ember, nem kedvelem én se
Azt mondja, nincs lelkem, ez a szakma része
Fejem fogom, csörög a telefonom
Mondják, hogy gyűrött vagyok, pedig csak
Beleszarok mindenbe, a sok kommentbe
Rám vetíted ki, hogy baj van a fejedbe
Pedig csak éneklek, kicsi pénzt is keresek
Ha nem tetszik valami, akkor minek nézitek?
Itt vagytok, néztek, jönnek a pénzek
Anya nézd meg, hogy mit csináltál
Folyton téptek, de még mindig élek
Andi nézd meg, hogy mit csináltál
Andi, Andi már megint mit csinálsz
Most olvastam storyba kiabálsz
Azt írják, hogy itt te tuti nem vagy józan
Azt is, hogy beszívtál, hadd higgyék azt, jól van
Fejem fogom, csörög a telefonom
Andi ez nem te vagy, biztos te jobban tudod
Nem tetszem, nem baj, túlélem
Mégis nézed minden nap, hol tart az életem
Pedig csak éneklek, kicsi pénzt is keresek
Ha nem tetszik valami, akkor minek nézitek?
You might also likeItt vagytok, néztek, jönnek a pénzek
Anya nézd meg, hogy mit csináltál
Folyton téptek, de még mindig élek
Andi nézd meg, hogy mit csináltál
Néztek, néztek, néztek
Minek nézel, minek írsz?
Visszaírok, aztán sírsz
Itt vagyok, nem hiszem, hogy érdekel

You see where I am, what I'm doing
You write that I'm shit, you little gold digger
People don't like me, I don't like them either
He says I have no soul, it's part of the profession
I shake my head, my phone rings
They say I'm wrinkled, but that's all
I get involved in everything, the many comments
You're projecting on me that there's something wrong with you
I'm just singing, I'm also earning a little money
If you don't like something, why are you watching it?
You are here, look, the money is coming
Mom, look what you've done
They kept tearing me apart, but I'm still alive
Andi, look what you did
Andi, Andi, what are you doing again?
I just read that you're yelling in the story
They say that you are not sane here
Also, that you smoked it, let them believe it, it's fine
I shake my head, my phone rings
Andi, it's not you, I'm sure you know better
I don't like it, it's okay, I'll survive
Yet you see where my life is every day
I'm just singing, I'm also earning a little money

Hihetetlen ez a világ
Hogy csak pénzen vásárolt
Lakásban meg mindent, találsz nyugalmat
Nőt is csak úgy találsz
Hogyha pénzen megveszel egy nőt
Mindenféle szar, büdös, mocskos dolgok
Vannak ebbe' a világba'
ÉS ÉN ILYEN VILÁGBA' ÉLEK!

Body in the bag, layin' on the cold ground
I ain't going back, I might end up in a coffin
You can't scare me, they be bluffin'
I got reasons to fuck up every night
And get a chance every morning
Bánod már, hogy élsz, de járod még az utadat
Nem érted mi lesz veled később, de majd megmutatod
Csak figyelj kicsit most, én dalolok neked!
Bár hallanád, a lényeg, a lényeget!
Hogy mikor a spanokkal a téren, régen L.L. Juni szólt
És bárki akit csak ismertem az palotai volt
Feladták az álmukat, feladták a vágyat
Belepi a sorsukat a beton meg a gyárak
Szívom a füstöt, lenn tartom (Ugh-ugh)
Kifújom, köhögtet, bassza meg!
Tudom, nem tesz jót ez az életmód
Bár tudnám, hogy is érthetnéd!

Most úgy érzem magam, mint Heisenberg vagy Jesse
Csak kicsit több a flexin'
Lakókocsiban főzök, a labor a Logic
A seb az utat mutat, befutok, miliós tétel lesz itt
Gyémánt Patek, Bentley, Prada, Gucci, Fendi
Versace, megvillan a csuklón
Egy pillanat alatt, minden forintom elszórom
Ez az a gang, aki sose fedi fel
Hogy a királyuk az maga Lucifer
De valakiknek, csupán csak tündermese lehet ez az sztori
Én igazat adok, én megadom
Megkíméllek a sztárságtól
Meg a heti ötszöri érzelmi válságtól, másik valóságtól
Sok a mende-monda, tudod, erről-arról
Mentem erre-arra, ez a Mennyből angyal
Ez a Szebb jövőt! egy kitakart ravasszal
Ez az öreg gitár, meg a piaszag vibe
Lehet kicsikét más, kicsikét frissebb
Kicsit prolibb, kicsit basz
Azok a sebek, amikről én vakerolok arra nincsen ragtapasz
Hiába vagyok mindig kész, vagyok minél nagyobb fasz
Kell a bulvárnak a beef, mint a gádzsiknak a szeretet
Van egy pár pretty little ebony baby a házban
Ha a kirakat örömöm, nyomom neked az gáz
Desh, te tudod-e hogy ez a fazon kinek magyaráz?
Hát testvérem, tudja a gyász!
Pontosan ez a gond veletek, ez a probléma!
Azt hiszitek, Aziról beszélni az egy jó téma
Megy a sok bla-bla-bla-bla-bla-bla rólam
Hogy hogyan érzek rá minden egyes kis nyüansznyi fortélyra
De huszonegy évesen, tesó, kajak leszarom
Hülye vagy, ha azt hiszed, hogy magam megadom
Ha mind ugyanoda tartunk, akkor faszér' megyünk hátra?
Gondolkozz, most elköszön a báttya!
Ó, babám, ne várj meg!
Ó, ne-ne, ne várj meg!
Kérlek, bébi, már ne várj

This world is incredible
That he only bought with money
Everything in the apartment, you will find peace of mind
You can find a woman just like that
If you buy a woman with money
All kinds of shitty, stinky, filthy things
There are in this world
AND I LIVE IN SUCH A WORLD!

Body in the bag, layin' on the cold ground
I ain't going back, I might end up in a coffin
You can't scare me, they be bluffin'
I got reasons to fuck up every night
And get a chance every morning
You regret being alive, but you're still on your way
You don't understand what will happen to you later, but you will show it
Just listen now, I'll sing for you!
If only you could hear it, the point, the point!
When with the spans on the square, long ago L.L. Juni said
And anyone I knew was from the palace
They gave up their dream, they gave up their desire
Concrete and factories will suffer their fate
I'm inhaling the smoke, keeping it down (Ugh-ugh)
I blow it out, it coughs, fuck it!
I know this lifestyle is not good for me
I wish I knew how you could understand!

There are too many memories that hurt

Now I feel like Heisenberg or Jesse
Just a little more flexin'
I cook in a caravan, the lab is Logic
The wound shows the way, I run in, there will be a million dollar item here
Diamond Patek, Bentley, Prada, Gucci, Fendi
Versace, flashes on the wrist
In a moment, I will scatter all my forints
This is the gang that never reveals
That their king is Lucifer himself
But for some, this story can only be a fairy tale
I give truth, I give
I'll spare you the stardom
And from the emotional crisis five times a week, from another reality
There's a lot of gossip, you know, about this and that
I went this way and that, this is an angel from Heaven
This is a better future! with a hidden trigger
It's the old guitar and the smell of sand vibe
It can be a little different, a little fresher
A little more pro, a little shit
There are no Band-Aids for the wounds I'm covering
Even though I'm always ready, I'm as big a dick as possible
The tabloids need beef, like the gajiks need love
There are a couple of pretty little ebony babies in the house
If the shop window is my pleasure, I'll push the gas for you
Desh, do you know who this guy is explaining to?
Well, my brother, grief knows!
This is exactly the problem with you, this is the problem!
You think talking about Azi is a good topic
There's a lot of blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah about me
How I feel about every little nuance of subterfuge
But at the age of twenty-one, bro, I'll ditch the kayak
You're a fool if you think I'll give it to you myself
If we're all going to the same place, are we going backwards?
Think about it, the brother is saying goodbye now!
Oh baby, don't wait!
Oh, no-no, don't wait!

Pont itt hagytam mindent, ami számít
Most meghalt minden vágyam
Tudom már nem változunk át (Á)
Lángra gyúlt az emlék
Mikor gyermekként az éjszakák is
Úgy ragyogtak rám, mint egykor rád (És elmúlt már)
Most érzem, minden más
Holnaptól jobb lesz már
Hát maradj még egy órát, mondd el (Mennyit érhetnénk?)
Nem kell, hogy megtarts már
Egyedül maradok ugyanúgy, ahogyan régen is
Nem bánom még (Annyit kérek még)

Figyelj rám!
Most ne figyelj rám!
Ha még ezer hibát követnél el
Csak fogd majd rám!
Csak fogd majd rám!
Ezt már csak fogd majd rám!

Szól a dembow, mamacita
Szívemben egy bomba robban fel
Otthonom lesz a magány
És tudom hiába várnék rád, ha már
Ki tudja hova lépsz, ki tudja merre
Megfogadtuk örökre gyerekеk maradunk
És azóta se nőttünk fel
Ezután én csak annyit kérek, most nе

Hogy ki lehetek én
Hova lett az az igaz ember?
Talán te magad loptad el (Hm)
Ígérem sosem mondom el!
Túl sok az álarc, vállald magad, ne egy démont!
Belement újra, pedig ő nem lesz hozzá méltó!
Túl vagy a nehezén, közel a célod
Ha eddig nem tetted, hát most se figyelj

Ha elátkoznak, figyelj rám a távolban!
Tudom, már nem várnak rám úgy, mint rég
Elhinném, ha változna, változok, hogyha máshonnan

I left everything that matters right here
Now all my desires are dead
I know we don't change anymore (Ah)
The memory caught fire
When as a child the nights too
They shined on me like they once shined on you (And it's gone)
Now I feel that everything is different
It will be better from tomorrow
Well stay another hour, tell me (How much could we get?)
You don't have to keep it anymore
I remain alone, the same as before
I don't mind yet (That's all I ask for)

Listen!
Don't listen to me now!
If you made a thousand more mistakes
Just take it from me!
Just take it from me!
Just take this from me!

Speaking of dembow, mamacita
A bomb explodes in my heart
Loneliness will be my home
And I know it would be useless to wait for you, if already
Who knows where you step, who knows where
We vowed to remain children forever
And we haven't grown up since then
After that, all I ask is, not now

Who can I be?
Where did that true man go?
Maybe you stole it yourself (Hm)
I promise I'll never tell!
There are too many masks, own yourself, not a demon!
He went in again, but he won't be worthy of it!
You are over it, your goal is close
If you haven't done it yet, don't listen now

On me!
Don't listen to me!
If you made a thousand more mistakes
Just take it from me!
Just take it from me!
(But no, you'll just take it from me!)
If they curse you, watch me in the distance!

Látom, hogy megismersz látom, hogy ennyire
Ennyire nem csalódtál nagyot, soha, senkiben
Üljünk le, beszéljünk, szerinted kár
Szerinted nem is én nyílok ki, csak mindenki más összezár
Valóban kevés ez, várd meg, míg folytatom
Told rám a savat, fiatal vagyok, még megszokom
Ne nyújtsd a kezed, annyi por ragadt az ujjadra
Már rég nem bírom átvenni, már rég nem veszem magamra
Nem vagyok hiszékeny, de azért megadnám
Ha egyszer, amit rólam beszélsz, hamarabb érne hozzám
Voltunk már pár helyen, de minden fotót töröltem
Mert nem hagyom, hogy visszajöjjön, amit már rég lelöktem

Miért mondod, hogy tönkrement minden
Zaj kell, de nem voltál még egyedül
Mire vágysz, én már mindent elértem
Én nem hagyom, hogy visszahúzzon, amit egyszer lelöktem
Miért mondod, hogy tönkremegy minden
Zaj kell, de nem voltál még egyedül
Mire vágysz, én már mindent elértem
Én nem hagyom, hogy visszahúzzon, amit egyszer lelöktem

Tartom, én tartom magam, hogyha jönnél
Tudtam, hogy lemaradsz
Én tartom, hogy beengedlek, hogyha késnél
De látom, hogy nem akarsz
Én tartom, tartom magam, hogyha jönnél
Tudtam, hogy lemaradsz
Én tartom, hogy beengedlek, hogyha késnél
Már látom, hogy nem akarsz

Félek kimondani, de tényleg nincs időm
Félek kimondani, hogy nem tanultál semmiből
Eddig csak brigád volt, már lett egy táborom
Annyian tartanak, hogy megállok a lábamon
Szerinted nagyot mondok, szerintem tényeket
Te is csak akkor maradsz csendben, mikor kérdezek
Remeg a kezem, tudod, hajlamos is vagyok rá
Ez eddig még csak közöny volt, most átalakult haraggá
Te is megtörtél, bejött pár diáklány
Bejött, hogy sosem tudtál megállni a határnál
Te átlátsz rajtam, én nem is vagyok ilyen
De te nem ismertél sosem, csak a pózt, amit épp felvettem

Miért mondod, hogy tönkrement minden
Zaj kell, de nem voltál még egyedül
Mire vágysz, én már mindent elértem

I see that you know me, I see that so much
You have never been so disappointed in anyone
Let's sit down and talk, do you think it's a shame?
In your opinion, I don't even open up, everyone else closes it down
That's really not enough, wait while I continue
Pour the acid on me, I'm young, I'm still getting used to it
Don't put your hand out, there's so much dust stuck on your finger
I can't take it for a long time, I can't take it on myself for a long time
I'm not gullible, but I'd give it anyway
If only what you talk about me would reach me sooner
We've been to a few places, but I deleted all the photos
Because I won't let it come back that I pushed away a long time ago

Why do you say that everything is ruined?
You need noise, but you weren't alone
What you desire, I have already achieved everything
I won't let him pull back what I once pushed down
Why do you say that everything is ruined
You need noise, but you weren't alone
What you desire, I have already achieved everything
I won't let him pull back what I once pushed down

I keep, I keep myself, if you come
I knew you'd be behind
I think I'll let you in if you're late
But I see you don't want to
I keep it, I keep myself, if you come
I knew you'd be behind
I think I'll let you in if you're late
I can already see you don't want to
You might also like
I'm afraid to say it, but I really don't have time
I'm afraid to say that you have learned nothing
Until now it was only a brigade, I now have a camp
There are so many of them that I can stand on my feet
You think I'm talking big, I think facts
You also only keep quiet when I ask
My hands shake, you know, I tend to
It was just indifference until now, now it turned into anger
You broke too, a couple of female students came in
It happened that you could never stop at the border
You see through me, I'm not like that
But you never knew me, only the pose I just took

Why do you say that everything is ruined?
You need noise, but you weren't alone
What you desire, I have already achieved everything
I won't let him pull back what I once pushed down

Van egy kis bibi
Nem vagy te Cardi B
Jön az Azi meg a Deshi
Lesz itt habibi
Bombay-bubble tea

A zenénk az narratív
Nem játszunk mi Aladdint

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Aladdin, Aladdin, Aladdin (Aladdin)
Rajtam villog testvérem a mokaszin (Mokaszin)
Véráramba kerül a kokain (Kokaina)
Kilövöm a bálnákat, mint Moby Dick
Dikk-dikk-dikk
Minden este, testvérem, nálunk robban a cigi, vagy a bong
Normális mértékben száguldunk, nem mint a Hamilton
Gringo, fuckboy, faszomon a bitch

Szük a kör, páran bent
A többi hoppon maradott, ja
Lehet kicsit más, de újat mutatunk
Nem jár a szád, ja, mert máskülönben nyelvet újítunk
Mert kicsit rocksztár
Ugyanúgy megtaláltam a helyem
Ez egy rossz lány
Élvezem és tudom, lesz még egy-két TikTok botrány
Ha elvesztettem a fejem, te ne szólj rám!

The circle is tight, a few inside

It may be a little different, but we are showing something new
You don't speak well, because otherwise we're innovating the language
Because he's a bit of a rock star

Tell me somethin', girl
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?

I'm fallin'
In all the good times, I find myself longin'
For change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryna fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?

I'm falling
In all the good times, I find myself longing
For change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

Tell me somethin', girl
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?

I'm fallin'
In all the good times, I find myself longin'
For change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryna fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?

I'm falling
In all the good times, I find myself longing
For change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us

Biztos ezzel megalázlak
De ne tévesszen meg a látszat
Nem én kezdtem, levadásztak
Nem szerettem egy percre sem
Esküszöm, most befejeztem
Visszaírok, hogy ne keressen
Nehogy ez a botlásom
Valamit is elrontson
Veszekedj, kiabálj, valamit mondj
Ezt iszonyúan sajnálom
De azt fontos tisztáznom
Hogy ami neked is, az nekem is ugyanúgy fáj
Sohasem hazudok már

Mostantól
Ez a szem nem igéz mást
Mostantól
Ez a kar nеm ölel mást
Mostantól
Ez a test nem akar mást
Mostantól

Szép szavak, csak szép szavak
Mondhatsz bármit, ha mást mutat
Rólad a tapasztalat
You might also likeSzőttük еgyütt a a terveket
De a legjobb rész most elveszett
Hogy értsem meg, ha te sem érted
Nekem ez a kis botlás
Valami egészen más
Ne akarj, ne remélj, ne hazudjál
Odavan a csendélet
Fáj, de ez nem lényeg
A levegő nehezebb szavaidnál
Sose lesz ugyanaz már

Mostantól
Ez a szem nem igéz már
Mostantól
Ez a kar nem ölel már
Mostantól
Ez a test nem akar már
Mostantól

Ne akarj mást
Ne ölelj mást
Ne szeress mástEmbed","1 ContributorNow Lyrics
I must be humiliating you with this
But don't be fooled by appearances
I didn't start it, they hunted me down
I didn't love him for a minute
I swear, I just finished
I'll write back so you don't search
Don't let this be my stumbling block
Make something bad
Fight, yell, say something
I am terribly sorry for this
But it's important for me to clarify that
That what hurts you hurts me as well
I never lie again

From now on
This eye spells nothing else
From now on
This arm hugs nothing else
From now on
This body wants nothing else
From now on

Nice words, just nice words
You can say anything if it shows otherwise
The experience is about you
You might also like We wove the plans together
But the best part is now lost
To make me understand if you don't either
This is a little stumbling block for me
Something completely different
Don't want, don't hope, don't lie
There is still life
It hurts, but that's beside the point
Air is heavier than your words
It will never be the same again

From now on
This eye no longer spells
From now on
This arm doesn't hug me anymore
From now on
This body doesn't want it anymore
From now on

Nem tudok mindig talpra esni csak felállni
Új alapra tenni, a régit lezárni
Fullasztó napok a víz alatt tartanának
Az idő telik, lassan varrja rám a szarkalábat
En napfényt vetettem, mégis vihart arattam
Miattad elviselem, míg a lábam kitart alattam
Az új tervek mellé mindig jönnek újabb terhek
Inkább letettem róla, hogy mindenkinek megfeleljek

Hiába esem szét, úgysem maradok úgy
Ez egy darabban is darabos út
Pedig lehetne már minden rossz álom a tegnapé
Hadd lapozzak oda, ahol újra  minden oké

Mint egy őszi levél, mit elfúj a szél
Én pont olyan egyеdül szállok
Nem számít, hogy még milyen hosszú a tél
Mert rád еzer évig is várok
Visszatér a tavasz, s te maradsz a virágom
Ha itt leszel, veled elfeledem a szomorúságom

Hiába lep el a gond, akkor is felfelé török
Amikor nincs talaj alattam és felettem dörög
Örök túlélő vagyok, ezek rég lefutott körök
Nem tudok visszaesni, ahhoz én túl mélyről jövök
Nem ijedek meg pár negatív látomástól
Mindig erősebbé tesz, ezért a változás jó
Még akkor is, ha fáj soha nem leszek a foglya
Aki hagyja, hogy visszahúzza, azt vissza is fogja
Még véletlen se vagyok tévedhetetlen
De valamiért nem hiszek a véletlenekben
Egyszer minden véget ér, olyan lesz, mint az elején
Amikor újra mi leszünk, és nem csak te meg én

I can't always get back on my feet
To put on a new foundation, to close the old one
Suffocating days would keep me under water
Time passes, it slowly sews the crow's feet on me
I sowed sunshine, yet reaped a storm
Because of you, I will bear it as long as my feet can hold me under me
New plans always come with new burdens
I rather put it down to please everyone

Even if I fall apart, I won't stay like that anyway
It is also a piecemeal road
It could all be yesterday's bad dream
Let me turn the page to where everything is okay again

Like an autumn leaf blown away by the wind
I'm just so alone
It doesn't matter how long the winter is
Because I will wait for you for a thousand years
Spring returns, and you remain my flower
If you're here, I'll forget my sadness with you

Even though I am surprised by the problem, I still push upwards
When there is no ground under me and it thunders above me
I am an eternal survivor, these are long-gone circles
I can't fall back, I'm coming from too deep for that
I am not afraid of a few negative visions
It always makes you stronger, so change is good
Even if it hurts, I will never be your prisoner
Whoever lets you pull it back will pull it back
I'm not infallible even by chance
But for some reason I don't believe in coincidences
Once everything ends, it will be as it was at the beginning
When it will be us again and not just you and me

De nyílhat még száz színű virág
Más ez a nyugati világ
Nem könnyű egy jó barátra találni
Nincs egy igaz barát

Ó, azok a régi szép emlékek
Soha el nem feledlek
Visszagondolva ez szebb
Mint mikor real-time éltem meg
Gyere, mondd el, hogy ez bűn
Mondd, hogy már eltemettek!
Gyere mondd el, hogy az időnk véges
„Ennyi jutott nekünk, keress mást!”
De el ne felejtsél!
Maradj velem még! Ennyi nem elég
Miér' akarom én, hogy legyen úgy, mint rég?
Miér', miér', miér', miér', miér' akarom? (Mindig ugyanúgy)
Túl sok lett a gond, habár el se hiszik
De marad, ami volt, csak én változok egy kicsit
Templitől a parkig, minden este party

Ez egy újabb kamu póz, ezer újabb kamu kép
Mind bevették, hogy a végén csak a teli bag a tét
Faszomat már, minek a hype?
Ne dirigálj!
Csak az a vibe, ha a cigimet tekerem
Gyújtom és ugyanígy adom tovább
De ne vedd még el!
Ennyit meg nem ér a pénz, nem
Lassan utolér a végzet
De tudd, hogy én emlékszem!

Más ez a nyugati világ (Más ez a nyuga—)
Nem könnyű egy jó barátra találni
Nincs egy igaz barát
De nyílhat még száz színű virág

Szóval yes, Azahriah
Brutálisan megy előre, ő…
I-i-ilyesmi, ilyesmi harmóniákat ír

Ó, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-babe…
Elvetted tőlem a világom
És szebbé varázsoltad
Nem vársz cserébe semmit
De a szíved az mától az enyém
Ó, sí, mami-mami-ma
Este megmutatom én
Beléd árasztom a lelkem
Ha a tested az enyém
Szól a nóta, táncolj még nekem!
Már bennragadtunk újra
Már nem menekülnék innen
Már régen megtanultam egyszer vége lesz
Bár most azt kívánom sose legyen így (Sose legyen így)
De mikor az idő begyógyít minden sebet, heget
Már nem vágyom rád és azt se tudtam mit kerestem itt
Vagy ott
Már fakul a kép, éget a vágy
Távol a fény, de te ne várj
Én megadom magam mindenkinek
Nem védekezem, ha így te jobbnak látod
Csak egy csókot csennék tőled el
Én csak egyetlen ártatlan
Én értékelem, hogy ti szeretitek ezt a számot
Csak azt akarom elmondani, hogy
Bárkinek bármi olyan sérelme van
A volt szerelmével, azt tudnia kell
Csak egy pár év, és semmivé válik, értitek
Kinövünk belőle, kinövünk belőle és továbblépünk
Akármennyire azt hisszük, hogy nem
Menjen tovább a szerep!
De én szeretném, hogy tudjátok, hogy
Bassza meg! Ha elhagyunk egy nőt, jön egy másik!Embed","6 ContributorsOkari Lyrics

But a hundred more colored flowers can bloom
This Western world is different
It's not easy to find a good friend
There is no one true friend

Oh, those good old memories
I will never forget you
It's nicer in retrospect
Like when I experienced it in real time
Come tell me it's a sin
Tell me they're already buried!
Come tell us our time is up
""That's all we got, look for something else!""
But don't forget!
Stay with me! That's not enough
Why do I want it to be like before?
What, what, what, what, what do I want? (Always the same)
It's become too much trouble, even if they don't believe it
But it remains what it was, only I change a little
From the church to the park, every night is a party

There are a couple of opponents
I almost broke with you guys (Whoah, huh)
This is another fake pose, a thousand more fake pictures
They all accepted that in the end only the full bag is at stake
Fuck me, what's the hype for?
Don't conduct!
It's just the vibe when I'm rolling my cigarette
I light it and pass it on in the same way
But don't take it yet!
It's not worth the money, no
Doom is slowly catching up
But know that I remember!

But a hundred more colored flowers can bloom
This western world is different (This west is different—)
It's not easy to find a good friend
There is no one true friend
But a hundred more colored flowers can bloom
This Western world is different
It's not easy to find a good friend

So yes, Azahriah
Going forward brutally, he…
He writes such and such harmonies

Oh ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-babe…
You took my world away from me
And you made it more beautiful
You don't expect anything in return
But your heart is mine from now on
Oh, ski, mami-mami-ma
I'll show you tonight
I pour my soul into you
If your body is mine
Play the note, dance for me!
We're already stuck again
I wouldn't run away from here anymore
I learned a long time ago that it will be over
Although now I wish it would never be like this (Never be like this)
But when time heals all wounds and scars
I don't want you anymore and I didn't even know what I was looking for here
Or there
The image is already fading, the desire is burning
The light is far away, but don't wait
I give myself to everyone
I'm not defending myself if that's what you think is better
I just want a kiss from you
I'm just an innocent
I appreciate that you guys like this track
I just want to say that
Anyone has any grievances
With your ex, you should know that
Just a couple of years and it'll be nothing, you see
We grow out of it, grow out of it and move on
As much as we think we don't
Let the role go on!
But I want you to know how

Ayy, ayy

I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (Star, ayy, ayy)
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta ('Sta)
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, them the shottas ('Tas)
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grrra-ta-ta-ta (Ta, pow, pow, pow, ayy, ayy)

Switch my whip, came back in black
I'm startin' sayin', ""Rest in peace to Bon Scott"" (Scott, ayy)
Close that door, we blowin' smoke
She ask me light a fire like I'm Morrison ('Son, ayy)
Act a fool on stage
Prolly leave my fuckin' show in a cop car (Car, ayy)
Shit was legendary
Threw a TV out the window of the Montage
Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn
Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryna get in
Sayin', ""I'm with the band"" (Ayy, ayy)

Amikor én reggel a testedet látom

The night is cold
I do not know when i will be at home
I have the doll with me

I say, I'll go
I'm going in today
Your two eyes, I'm slowly getting into it
I want more, more

I like it in the morning, I like it in the evening
I love when you are with me everyday
When I see your body in the morning
I have a huge appetite
I don't know where he's going
That's the business
He goes with me, he goes with me

I say, I'll go
I'm going in today
Your two eyes, I'm slowly getting into it
I want more, more

The bed creaks better
Go home

Emlékszem régen más volt
Ott vártak rám és arra, mit kiáltok
Már réges-rég otthonra lelt a bánatom
Nem bánom én
Hisz úgyis nagyon rég volt
Ha egyszer visszatérsz talán én titkon úgyis várok rád
De máskor is, ha kellenél
Ne válassz, ezt a terhet úgyse bírnám!
Hiába minden szép szó
És hogyha útunk egyszer véget apránként
Igérem visszaváltok mindent, mit adtál, még
Tudom, hogy benned is ott lapul a bánat, bent valahol
Mondd, miért is játszanék veled, higgy nekem!
Én arra kérlek, várj amíg újra megtörténik!
És tudom, mit teszek
Bár már érzem azt, hogy lassan itt a vége

Ma este tisztán iszom a Bombayt
Mert csak így szeretlek igazán téged, baby
Gyere velem, táncolj még!
Hogy minden legyen ugyanolyan, mint régen, baby

Csak szeretnék már boldogan élni
És táncolni

Ma este tisztán iszom a Bombayt
Mert csak így szeretlek igazán téged, baby
Gyere velem, táncolj még!
Hogy minden legyen ugyanolyan, mint régen, baby

Hát gyere, gyere, gyere velem, megmutatom én
Hogy mitől vagyok boldog, nem is fáj, ha véget érne
Ha Isten is így látja, hát nem hagyom, hogy a végén
Ne legyek boldog én

Ezért ma este tisztán iszom a Bombayt
Mert csak így szeretlek igazán téged
Gyere velem, táncolj még!
Legyen ugyanolyan, mint régen

I remember it was different a long time ago
They were there waiting for me and what I was shouting
My grief found a home a long time ago
I don't mind
After all, it was a long time ago
If you ever come back, maybe I'll be secretly waiting for you anyway
But other times too, if you need to
Don't choose, I can't bear this burden anyway!
All nice words are in vain
And if our journey ends little by little
I promise I will return everything you have given me
I know that the sorrow lurks inside you too, somewhere inside
Tell me why I should play with you, believe me!
I'm asking you to wait until it happens again!
And I know what I'm doing
Although I already feel that the end is almost here

I'm drinking Bombay neat tonight
Because that's the only way I really love you, baby
Come with me, dance some more!
For everything to be the same as before, baby

I drank too much yesterday
And they carried me through the public roads
I applied for everything on credit

And to dance

I'm drinking Bombay neat tonight
Because that's the only way I really love you, baby
Come with me, dance some more!
For everything to be the same as before, baby

Come, come, come with me, I'll show you
What makes me happy doesn't hurt if it ends
If God sees it that way, I won't let it end
Don't be happy

That's why I'm drinking Bombay neat tonight
Because that's the only way I really love you
Come with me, dance some more!
Be the same as before

Csak a szegény, ki most is vacog
Lenn az utcán, lenn a téren
Először nappal, aztán éjjel
Nézem a földet, értem a csöndet
Kiszáradt aggyal jön meg az ötlet
Azt is megértem, amit te nem értesz
Ezért az életem nem hasonlít a tiédhez
És mindegy nekem az is, hogyha ordibálsz
Mert tenni nem tudsz semmit, csak úgy csinálsz
Lehet, hogy többet vársz tőlem, mint magadtól
Lehet, hogy forradalmat akarsz pusztán szavakból
Lehet, az ellenséged ellensége én vagyok
Lehet, az ördög sem segít, sem az angyalok

Down in the street, down in the square
First during the day, then at night
I look at the ground, I understand the silence
The idea comes with a dried up brain
I also understand what you don't
Therefore, my life is not like yours
And I don't care if you yell
Because you can't do anything, you just do it
Maybe you expect more from me than you expect from yourself
Maybe you want a revolution out of words alone
Maybe the enemy of your enemy is me
Maybe neither the devil nor the angels help

Look out for yourself

I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground
I'm searchin' to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world that was smilin' when I turned

Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us

Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy-y-y-y-y (Look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
But I'm ready

Your words up on thе wall as you're prayin' for my fall
And the laughter in thе halls and the names that I've been called
I stack it in my mind, and I'm waitin' for the time
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic

I'm hopin' that somebody pray for me
I'm prayin' that somebody hope for me
I'm stayin' where nobody 'posed to be p-p-posted
Being a wreck of emotions
Ready to go whenever, just let me know
The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable
I'ma tell 'em, ""Hasta luego""
They wanna plot on my trot to the top
I been outta shape, thinkin' out the box, I'm an astronaut
I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe
And it matters more because I had it not
Had I thought about wreaking havoc
On an opposition, kinda shockin' they wanted static
With precision, I'm automatic quarterback
I ain't talkin' sackin', pack it
Pack it up, I don't panic, batter-batter up
Who the baddest? It don't matter 'cause we at your throat
Everybody wants to be my enemy

(Olyat mondok megint, olyat mondok megint ja)
Túl vagyok rajta, de néha visszamennék
Nem volt az úgy jó soha, alig van szép emlék
A szerotonin szintem kiürítem én még
Rossz esték, sokszor még

Évek óta nem voltam már boldog
Ilyenkor jönnek mind a rossz dolgok
Ő nem is tudta, hogy milyen vagyok
És szeretni is csak rosszul tudok
Harcoltunk, öltük egymást, hányszor?
Szakítottunk, összejöttünk párszor
Haraptam, imádtam a seggét
De közben, sokszor elhagytam a lelkét
Ő meg csak gyereket akart
Meg azt, hogy én végre fel is nőjek
És azt gondolta, hogy ő sokkal bölcsebb
De mindig én voltam a szabadabb

Túl vagyok rajta, de néha visszamennék
Nem volt az úgy jó soha, alig van szép emlék
A szerotonin szintem kiürítem én még
Rossz esték, sokszor még
Túl vagyok rajta, de néha visszamennék
Nem volt az úgy jó soha, alig van szép emlék

Sok lány megfordult közben az ágyamban
De én egyiknek sem hazudtam
Mondtam, hogy nem lesz ebből szerelem
Se most, se később nem is keresem
És mérgeztem, mérgeztem a testem
Mások mikor feküdtek, én keltem
Rengeteg sok csókot elígértem
A reggelekre volt, hogy alig éltem
Sok idő eltelt, végig egyedül
Hosszú volt, és mégis elrepült
Azt mondják, meg kell élni hamarabb
De közben, én vagyok a szabadabb

Túl vagyok rajta, de néha visszamennék
Nem volt az úgy jó soha, alig van szép emlék
A szerotonin szintem kiürítem én még
Rossz esték, sokszor még
Túl vagyok rajta, de néha visszamennék
Nem volt az úgy jó soha, alig van szép emlék
A szerotonin szintem kiürítem én még
Rossz esték, sokszor még

Már túl-túl-túl vagyok rajtad
Nélküled értem mindent el, amit akartam
Talán még most is itt lennél velem a bajban
De még ezt is képes voltam tönkretenni
Neked trauma, nekem meg bűntudat
Elon Musk a szívemben is űrt kutat
Álmomban még láthatom a testét
Rossz esték, sokszor még
Gyúlékony szívemből, nem adhatok semmit
Szikrázó szemeidnek én vagyok a benzin
És ha belehalok, vizsgáljátok meg az agyamat
Mert nem értem, hogy kettőnk közül
Miért én vagyok szabadabb
Túl vagyok rajta, de néha visszamennék
Nem volt az úgy jó soha, alig van szép emlék
A szerotonin szintem kiürítem én még
Rossz esték, sokszor még
Túl vagyok rajta, de néha visszamennék
Nem volt az úgy jó soha, alig van szép emlék

(I'll say it again, I'll say it again)
I'm over it, but I'd go back sometimes
It was never that good, there are hardly any good memories
I'm still emptying my serotonin level
Bad nights, often still

I haven't been happy in years
That's when all the bad things happen
He didn't even know what I was like
And I'm just bad at loving
We fought, killed each other, how many times?
We broke up, got together a couple of times
I bit, I loved her ass
But in the meantime, I left his soul many times
She just wanted a child
And that I finally grow up
And he thought he was much wiser
But I was always the freer one

I'm over it, but I'd go back sometimes
It was never that good, there are hardly any good memories
I'm still emptying my serotonin level
Bad nights, often still
I'm over it, but I'd go back sometimes
It was never that good, there are hardly any good memories

Many girls turned over in my bed
But I didn't lie to anyone
I told you it wouldn't be love
I'm not looking for it now or later
And I poisoned, poisoned my body
When others went to bed, I got up
I promised lots and lots of kisses
It was for the mornings that I was barely alive
It's been a long time, all alone
It was long and yet it flew by
They say you have to live sooner
But in the meantime, I'm the freer one

I'm over it, but I'd go back sometimes
It was never that good, there are hardly any good memories
I'm still emptying my serotonin level
Bad nights, often still
I'm over it, but I'd go back sometimes
It was never that good, there are hardly any good memories
I'm still emptying my serotonin level
Bad nights, often still

I'm so, so, so over you
I achieved everything I wanted without you
Maybe even now you would be here with me in trouble
But I was able to destroy even that
Trauma for you, guilt for me
Elon Musk is also exploring a void in my heart
I can still see his body in my dreams
Bad nights, often still
From my fiery heart, I can give nothing
I am the fuel for your sparkling eyes
And if I die, examine my brain
Because I don't understand that between the two of us
Why am I freer?
I'm over it, but I'd go back sometimes
It was never that good, there are hardly any good memories
I'm still emptying my serotonin level
Bad nights, often still
I'm over it, but I'd go back sometimes

Volt már kicsi nyár, de hosszú még a tél
A lelkemben így él, a szerelem
Volt már kicsi szép, de az is nagyon rég
Koszos halvány kép, a szerelem

Lehet az is nincs lelkem, mégis valahol bennem
Benne van a testemben, az a szerelem
Valamilyen méreg volt a szívemen egy mocskos volt
Valamikor fontos volt, az a szerelem
Mindenki csak baszakodik ezzel
Valahol egy mérgező ex-szel
Pedig nem a megfelelő ember
Belehalunk mégis a végén
Szeretünk de úgyis széttép
A szerelem magányos mélység
(Olyat mondok megint bébe.)

It's been a short summer, but the winter is still long
This is how love lives in my soul
It used to be beautiful, but it was a long time ago
Dirty pale picture, love

Maybe I don't have a soul, but somewhere inside me
It's in my body, that love
There was some kind of poison in my heart, it was filthy
Once upon a time, love was important
Everyone is just screwing with it
Somewhere with a toxic ex
He's not the right person
We die in the end though
We love it, but it tears us apart anyway
Love is a lonely depth
(I'll say that again, baby.)

It's been a short summer, but the winter is still long
This is how love lives in my soul
It used to be beautiful, but it was a long time ago

It wasn't that long ago, love winked at me
But he always makes fun of me, he walks through my heart
But maybe it suits me, I'm always alone, I'm used to it
I run away when you catch me
I can't love, I said
Because I wouldn't be happy with anyone else
I was waiting because I have turned into a fog many times before
My heart of ice can't melt for too long
Now promise me you'll wait for me if I snuggle up to you

It's been a short summer, but the winter is still long
This is how love lives in my soul
It used to be beautiful, but it was a long time ago
Dirty pale picture, love
It's been a short summer, but the winter is still long

I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak

Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose

And wanna leave my own life behind

{Verze: Nemazalány}
Pezsgésre vágyok, én a zajban születtem
Dallamok szóltak már akkor is a fülemben
A zеne volt az első, nem lеhet soha vége
Célokkal ébredek, este pedig színpad végre
Nem hittek bennem, mégis azon az úton járok
Amit még a térképen bejelölve találtok
Hosszú volt, de még nem értem a célhoz
Másszunk meg hegyeket ameddig csak bírjuk
{Verze: Milo}
Van kápé, mert milliók néznek
Sokan nem tudják hogy ára van a pénznek
Hála az égnek, teltek az évek
Úgy alakítottam, hogy minden napunk péntek
Tudtam, hogy mi a követendő példa
Folyik a lé, soha nem elég, soha nem elég (ja)
Rosszabb napokon is álljon jól a széna

Bocsi anya, nem lett egyetem
De amit csinálok, azt én szeretem
Nem hiszem, hogy valaha befejezem
Mert már milliók fújják a szövegem
Tekered a csípőd, ha a klubba belépsz
El sem hiszem, hogy lejátsszák a zeném
Összeraktam magamnak egy álomvilágot
Amit anno bennem senki se látott
{Verze: Sofi}
Az álmomat élem, nincs szárnyam, de szállok
Nincs akadály, mert én érzek és látok
Tudom a célom az messze van még
De utakat törünk, és látjuk a fényt
Éjjeli múzsa a hold körül táncol
Éljünk meg mindent, mit ad ez a mámor
Álljunk meg ott, ahol pihennünk kell
De induljunk tovább, sose adjuk fel

Sleepless nights

Many are already sleeping

I could live through it
The juice is flowing, the life is spinning (Yeah)
But the picture is not simple

{Verse: Nemazalány}
I crave bubbly, I was born in noise
Melodies were already playing in my ears
The music was the first, it can never end
I wake up with goals, and in the evening it's finally the stage
They didn't believe in me, yet I'm on that path
What you found marked on the map
It's been a long time, but I haven't reached the goal yet
Let's climb mountains as long as we can
{Verse: Milo}
There is cable because millions are watching
Many people don't know the value of money
Thank goodness the years have passed
I made it so that every day is Friday
I knew the example to follow
The juice is flowing, never enough, never enough (yeah)
Even on worse days, the hay should stand well

Sorry mom, I didn't go to university
But I love what I do
I don't think I'll ever finish it
Because millions are already blowing my text
You roll your hips when you enter the club
I can't believe they're playing my music
I put together a dream world for myself
What no one saw in me back then
{Verse: Sofi}
I'm living my dream, I don't have wings, but I fly
There is no obstacle because I feel and see
I know my goal is still far away
But we are breaking through and seeing the light
His night muse dances around the moon
Let's experience everything this intoxication has to offer
Let's stop where we need to rest
But let's keep going, never give up

In the fading light, hearts collide
Shadows dance in the distance
Something just ain't right, I'm cold inside
Help me find what I'm missin'

We're all scared to fly, still we try
Learn to be brave, see the other side
Won't you lead me there? Have no fear
Close your eyes, find paradise

Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes

Mama said, fulfill the prophecy
Be something greater, go make a legacy
Manifest destiny, back in the days
We wanted everything, wanted everything
Mama said, burn your biographies
Rewrite your history, light up your wildest dreams
Museum victories, every day
We wanted everything, wanted everything

Ugh, you're a monster

I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla
Better hit the deck like the card dealer
My whole squad's in here, walking around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby ""The
Brain"" Heenan which is probably the
Same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia
ADHD, Hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisier (Hey, hey)
In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (Ayy)
This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A
Laughing all the way to the bank, I spray flames
They cannot tame or placate the

Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters

Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster

I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled, did so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on the guy with a missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of vodka
When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a

Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
If you never gave a damn (Ayy), raise your hand
'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her
Face in my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Cristhian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
So they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Hari Kari
'Cause e'ry Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em
Swearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (Monster)
Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets
Evil, that means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade
I'm finna kill 'em and dump all their fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me outta me
You don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
And be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be

Egy pudva verda visz a klubba
Full a telt ház tele, pedig ez egy kurva szerda
Ez már nem a régi, már nem a régi
Szar flow, szar rím, szar dallam
Látom, hogy nem tetszik az új rap és akkor mondd, mi a fasz van?
Mi a fasz van itt tesó?

(Olyat mondok megint bébe)

Az univerzum kiömlött elém
Sötét van a szobában, nincs fény
Olyan vagyok mint valami rém
Fekete a szívem mint a szén
Ne haragudj rám, ha bántani foglak
Szeretni nem tudok igazán
Emlékszem neked is mondtam
De tudod, hogy tetszel
Gyere újra egy szex-szel
Meleg a jacuzzi, forró a tested is
Ami kell, vedd el

A szádban jó az ájkosz, az ágyban jó a tested
Ha józanok maradnánk, hogy úgy mondjam szeretlek
A történetünk másként, más dimenzió lenne
De ígyis sokat jár az agyam rajtad minden estе
A szádban jó az ájkosz, az ágyban jó a tested
Ha józanok maradnánk, hogy úgy mondjam szerеtlek
A történetünk másként, más dimenzió lenne
De ígyis sokat jár az agyam rajtad minden este

Nem kéne ilyet csinálnod
Szerintem ez neked nem jó
Féltelek tőle, te is tudod, hogy méreg
Hogy fogjuk szeretni egymást
Így amikor tőled is félek?

A szádban jó az ájkosz, az ágyban jó a tested
Ha józanok maradnánk, hogy úgy mondjam szeretlek
A történetünk másként, más dimenzió lenne
De ígyis sokat jár az agyam rajtad minden este
A szádban jó az ájkosz, az ágyban jó a tested

(I'll say that again baby)

The universe poured out before me
The room is dark, there is no light
I'm like some kind of horror
My heart is black as coal
Don't be angry with me if I hurt you
I can't really love
I remember I told you too
But you know I like you
Come again with a sex
The jacuzzi is hot, so is your body
Take what you need

Your mouth is good, your body is good in bed
If only we could stay sober so I could say I love you
Our story would be different, a different dimension
But anyway, I think about you a lot every night
Your mouth is good, your body is good in bed
If only we could stay sober so I could say I love you
Our story would be different, a different dimension

Vásárlás, money making, szopatás a hobbim
És ingyen jön ki rosszlányokról minden egyes prosti
Örül hogy velem lehet és ingyen szophat nyolcig
Ez vagyok ez a KKevin power
Már megint rádver
Én megszökök mint Szájer
Magadtól ne szállj el
Mert levarrtalak kiscica
Nem csak rapben, szexben is jó a ritmika
Tudom már unalmas, hogy csak arról beszélek
Hogy mennyi pénzt kerestem és hogy mennyit kefélek
A faszom se gondolta, hogy majd ennyit еlérek
Én feka vagyok, véletlеn születtem fehérnek
Mindenki ismer ha lemegyünk a citybe
Mi sose leszünk kicsibe
Ilyen vagyok rajnak születtem
A színpadon robbantjuk be a cigiket
Megdöglenek az irigyek
A sikereket mindig ünneplem
Szűk körben maradunk megmarad a barát meg a család
Áthivogatom az ellenségeimnek a csaját
Ha belépünk a klubba mindenki leszopja magát
Milliomos vagyok tesó mégis hordok zarát

Itallapot nem kérünk hisz nekünk úgyis futja

Gyere tesó a legdrágábbat azonnal hozd ki
Ezek vagyunk tripla áron minősített topshit
Ránézésre megmondom az ilyenről hogy escort
Azt kamuzza hogy neki még paliból csak egy volt
Pedig többen tologatják olyan mint egy matchbox
Csapatjátékos a csaj hisz mindenkinek meg volt
Tuti nem eredeti
Látom meg nem teheti
Amit én egy nap alatt ő egy hónapban keresi
De nem akarok többet beszélni én már a pénzről, a pénzről, a pénzről
Azt próbálom mondani hogy ők is ugyanolyanok
De legbelül jól tudom más ha én szólalok meg
Mert erőre tettem szert
Dolgoztam mikor ő fel sem kelt
Nem kellesz már
Megcsinálom nélküled is meglesz lásd
Megint én vagyok a fasz
Megint én vagyok a fasz
Mér' én vagyok hibás ha a csajod irogat?
Már megint éjfél
Megindulok a pénzért
Látják hogy meleg ez a szar
Vakmeleg ez szar
Már nincsen mérték
Tudom hogy kérsz még
Látom hogy bejön ez a szar
Ő is engem akarEmbed","2 ContributorsTopshit LyricsBrother, what I touch will be gold because it's topshit
My hobbies are shopping, money making, and sucking
And every single prostitute gets out of bad girls for free
He's happy to be with me and suck until eight for free
I am this KKevin power
He's hitting on you again
I run away like Szajer
Don't get away from yourself
Because I beat you, baby
Rhythm is good not only in rap, but also in sex
I know it's boring to just talk about that
How much money I've earned and how much I spend
I didn't even think I would reach this much
I'm feka, I was born white by accident
Everyone knows him when we go down to the city
We will never be small
That's how I am, I was born to be a raj
We blow up cigarettes on stage
The envious will die
I always celebrate successes
We remain in a narrow circle, friends and family remain
I will transfer the girl to my enemies
When we enter the club, everyone sucks
I'm a millionaire, bro, but I'm wearing a sack
You might also like I'm going to have a cigarette outside, is anyone coming?
We don't ask for a drink card, because it works for us anyway
What is partying for you is work for us
Come bro, bring out the most expensive one right away
We are triple-price certified topshit
I can tell by looking at this that it is an escort
He pretends that he only had one from Pali
However, many people push it around like a matchbox
The girl is a team player, because everyone had it
Not original at all
I see you can't
What I earn in a day, he earns in a month
But I don't want to talk about money, money, money anymore
I'm trying to say that they are the same
But deep down I know it's different if I speak up
Because I gained strength
I was working when he didn't even get up
I don't need you anymore
I'll do it without you, see
It's me again
It's me again
Is it my fault if your girlfriend cheats?
It's midnight again
I'm going for the money

It's blindly gay

Közelebb ülök, mert így melegebb
Elküldhetsz, úgysеm lehetek szívtеlenebb (ha-ha)

Olyat gondolok, mi nem illendő
Esküszöm, nem vagyok vallásos
De úgy nézel ki mint egy istennő (uh-uh-uh)
Nem mondd már, hogy nem vagy olyan lány
Álom vagy, várom, hogy valóra válj
A szememet nézd, csaló a száj
A “semmit a kéznek” nem nekem való szabály
Hiába voltak ott páran
Én leszek az első, ki alszik a szobádban
Ez a nézés az, amire vártam
Egy a kérdés csak; van-e gumi nálam?

Nekem azt mondták, hogy egyszer te is szerelmes leszel
És megtalálod azt a lányt, akit majd elveszel
Előtte összejöhetsz még vagy ezerkétszáz emberrel
Mert telhetetlen vagy és téged is az érdekel
Ami engem meg a Petit meg a Gyurit vagy az Atit
Egészen addig, míg meg nem látod az igazit
És ha megtalálod őt, egyszer az igazi nőt
Akkor rendezünk egy ezerkétszáz fős vidéki lagzit

Mert a szerelem egy drog és ha eljön az idő, immunissá válunk
Minden rosszra és minden jóra, így járunk, élünk, vágyunk
Ez egy szintetikus szer, amitől néhányaknak borzasztó az a másnap
De vannak úgy, mint ő meg én és immunissá válnak

Ahogy telnek az évek, a toleranciaszint egyre inkább növekszik
A kemoreceptorok fullon vannak, ha vele kel és vele fekszik
Ez egy ugyanolyan kémiai reakció, amiről sohasem tudtam semmit
De tizedikben feleltem a kettesért
És megtanultam még én is valamennyit

Mert a szerelem egy drog és ha eljön az idő, immunissá válunk
Minden rosszra és minden jóra, így járunk, élünk, vágyunk
Ez egy szintetikus szer, amitől néhányaknak borzasztó az a másnap
De vannak úgy, mint ő meg én és immunissá válnak

I was told that one day you too will fall in love
And you'll find the girl you're about to lose
Before that, you can get together with another thousand or two hundred people
Because you are insatiable and you care too
As for me and Petit and Gyuri or Atit
Until you see the real thing
And if you find her, someday the real woman
Then we will organize a rural lagzi for twelve hundred people

Because love is a drug and when the time comes, we become immune
For all bad and all good, this is how we walk, live, desire
It's a synthetic drug that makes the next day awful for some people
But there are people like him and me who become immune

As the years go by, the tolerance level increases more and more
The chemoreceptors are full if you wake up with him and lie down with him
It's the same chemical reaction that I never knew anything about
But I was responsible for the second in the tenth
And I learned something too

I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do you recognise me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

With a note saying, ""I love you,"" I meant it

Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart

I'll give it to someone special (Special)

Ah, ah-ah
Ooh-woah
Oh-oh

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do you recognise me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
""Happy Christmas,"" I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying, ""I love you,"" I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face of a lover with a fire in his heart

Woo, woo
I pull up like
How you pull up, Baby? How you pull up? (Oh, oh, oh)
How you pull up? I pull up (Woo, SethInTheKitchen)

Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar? (Yeah)
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (Woo)
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me (Woo)
You better let me go the day you need me (Woo)
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (Woo)
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop

It's safe to say I earned it, ain't a nigga gave me nothin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm ready to hop out on a nigga, get to bustin'
Know you heard me say, ""You play, you lay,"" don't make me push the button
Full of pain, dropped enough tears to fill up a fuckin' bucket
Goin' for buckets, I bought a chopper
I got a big drum, it hold a hundred, ain't goin' for nothin'
I'm ready to air it out on all these niggas, I can see 'em runnin'
Just talked to my mama, she hit me on FaceTime just to check up on me and my brother
I'm really the baby, she know that her youngest son was always guaranteed to get the money (Okay, let's go)
She know that her baby boy was always guaranteed to get the loot
She know what I do, she know 'fore I run from a nigga, I'ma pull it out and shoot (Boom)
PTSD, I'm always waking up in cold sweats like I got the flu
My daughter a G, she saw me kill a nigga in front of her before the age of two
And I'll kill another nigga too
'Fore I let another nigga do somethin' to you
Long as you know that, don't let nobody tell you different
Daddy love you (Yeah, yeah)

Keep a Glocky when I ride in the Suburban
'Cause the codeine had a young nigga swervin'
I got the mop, watch me wash 'em like detergent
And I'm ballin', that's why it's diamonds on my jersey
Slide on opps' side and flip the block back, yeah, yeah
My junior popped him and left him lopsided, yeah, yeah
We spin his block, got the rebound, Dennis Rodman
Fool me one time, you can't cross me again
Twelve hundred horsepower, I get lost in the wind
If he talkin' on the yard, the pen' dogs'll take his chin
Maybach SUV for my refugees
Buy blocks in the hood, put money in the streets
I was solo when the opps caught me at the gas station
Had it on me, thirty thousand, thought it was my last day
But they ain't even want no smoke
If I had to choose it, murder what she wrote

Ülj le mellém, valamit mondok!
Szomjas vagy látom
Egy üveg bort kibontok, figyelj!

Lehet, hogy nem vagy gyenge
De ha a szívedbe szalad a penge
Attól nem érzed magad jobban
Ha a kocsidban bomba robban
Tudom én, erős vagy, persze
De ha a fejedben ott van a fejsze
Vagy a fegyver csövébe nézel
Ott már semmire nem mész pénzzel, és
Hiába vagy gazdag
Ha az égiek leszavaznak
A kocka, ha el van vetve
Te meg a föld alá temetve
Ott már hiába van ügyvéd
Aki a törvényektől megvéd
Itt senki se golyóálló és
Ha szakad a védőháló

A halálugrás végén, a túlvilági tévén

Majd rólad szólnak a hírek, veled van tele a sajtó
Aki a pokolra kíván jutni, annak balra a második ajtó
De ha a Szentpéter-szigetekre már
Be van fizetve az útja önnek
A Mennyország Tourist a legjobb szolgáltatást nyújtja

És lehet hogy nem vagy gyáva és
A végén te maradsz állva
De mire jó úgy ez az élet
Hogyha futnod kell, amíg éled? És
Hiába vagy bátor
Mint egy római gladiátor
Aki keményebb, mint a szikla
Mégis lehet, hogy elég egy szikra

A gyújtózsinór végén és a túlvilági tévén

Majd rólad szólnak a hírek, veled van tele a sajtó
Aki a pokolra kíván jutni, annak balra a második ajtó
De ha a Szentpéter-szigetekre már
Be van fizetve az útja önnek
A Mennyország Tourist a legjobb szolgáltatást nyújtja
Mi Atyánk, ki vagy a mennyekbe', mondd csak, melyik ajtón menjek be?
Mi Atyánk, ki vagy a mennyekbe', mondd csak, melyik ajtón menjek be?
Mi Atyánk, ki vagy a mennyekbe', mondd csak, én melyik ajtón menjek be?
Mi Atyánk, ki vagy a mennyekbe, mondd csak…

Az emberek meg néznek, hogy az Isten a pénz lett
Sorban nyílnak a bankok és az jelenti a rangot
Hogy mennyire állat az autód, mekkora mellű a nőd és hogy
Meddig bírod feltekerni a kocsidban a hangerőt
A kocsidban a hangerőt

(Éj, é, é)
Rólad szólnak a hírek, veled van tele a sajtó
Aki a pokolra kíván jutni, annak balra a második ajtó
De ha a Szentpéter-szigetekre már
Be van fizetve az útja önnek

Sit next to me, I'll tell you something!
I see you are thirsty
I'm opening a bottle of wine, listen!

You may not be weak
But if the blade runs into your heart
It doesn't make you feel better
If a bomb explodes in your car
I know, you're strong, of course
But if you have the ax in your head
Or you're looking down the barrel of a gun
You won't go anywhere with money there, and
You're rich for nothing
If the heavens vote
The die, if cast
You buried under the ground
There's no need for a lawyer there
Who protects you from the law
No one is bulletproof here
If the protective net breaks

At the end of the death jump, on the otherworldly TV
You might also like
The news will be about you, the press is full of you
If you want to go to hell, the second door is on the left
But if you go to the St. Peter's Islands already
Your trip is paid for
Heaven Tourist provides the best service

And maybe you're not a coward and
In the end, you are left standing
But what good is this life
What if you have to run while you live? And
You're not brave
Like a Roman gladiator
Who is harder than rock
Still, a spark might be enough

At the end of the fuse and on afterlife TV

The news will be about you, the press is full of you
If you want to go to hell, the second door is on the left
But if you go to the St. Peter's Islands already
Your trip is paid for
Heaven Tourist provides the best service
Our Father, who are you in heaven, just tell me which door should I enter?
Our Father, who are you in heaven, just tell me which door should I enter?
Our Father, who art thou in heaven, tell me which door shall I enter?
Our Father, who are you in heaven, just say...

People see that God has become money
Banks open in a row and that means rank
How big your car is, how big your breasts are and how
How long can you turn up the volume in your car?
The volume in your car

(Night, night, night)
The news is about you, the press is full of you
If you want to go to hell, the second door is on the left
But if you go to the St. Peter's Islands already
Your trip is paid for
Heaven Tourist provides the best service

Our Father, who are you in heaven, just tell me which door should I enter?
Our Father, who are you in heaven, just tell me which door should I enter?
Our Father, who are you in heaven, just tell me which door should I enter?
Our Father, who are you in heaven, just tell me which door should I enter?

Ooh

I saw you dancing in a crowded room (Uh)
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye

I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away

You could've asked me why I broke your heart
You could've told me that you fell apart
But you walked past me like I wasn't there
And just pretended like you didn't care

I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away

Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another

I said some things that I should never say

And now you won't love me for a second time

I don't know why I run away, oh, girl

Ratatatatata

Csak járom az utcákat, egy csavargó vagyok, pont ahogyan rég
Minden este hangosan szólít az éjszaka
Begyújtok egy dzsangát és az élet egyből szép
Nem szeretek józan lenni, jó a képzavar

Ay, tudom hogy nektek ez idegen, hogy ilyen gyorsan élek
Sajnos engem gyerekként is messziről elkerült már a józan élet
Legalább nem lettek oda a kósza évek
Menetelek fel a hegyre, soha nem hagyom abba, amíg forr a vérеm

Egy kicsit szétszórt, egy kicsit kótyagos
Szívemen vérfolt, dе azért jól vagyok
Engem megtaláltok az úton
Megyek, a szekeremet húzom

Csak járom az utcákat, egy csavargó vagyok, pont ahogyan rég
Minden este hangosan szólít az éjszaka
Begyújtok egy dzsangát és az élet egyből szép
Nem szeretek józan lenni, jó a képzavar

Egy bor meg én, kóborolok a tó jegén
Velem együtt jár a jó kedély
Körülöttűnk minden hófehér
Shit, az élet egy vicc, minden tesó illúzió
Semmi nincsen ingyen mi jó
Hidd el diló, illúzió
Csak látod, de nincs ott, csinálod
Pedig vágod, hogy tiltott
Imádod, hogy a tüzet szítom
Ugyanaz maradtam, aki ismer az tudja jól
Hogy nem letérdeltem, hanem felálltam minden kudarcból

Egy kicsit szétszórt, egy kicsit kótyagos
Szívemen vérfolt, de azért jól vagyok
Engem megtaláltok az úton
Megyek, a szekeremet húzom

Csak járom az utcákat, egy csavargó vagyok, pont ahogyan rég
Minden este hangosan szólít az éjszaka
Begyújtok egy dzsangát és az élet egyből szép
Nem szeretek józan lenni, jó a képzavar

Te tudod a pacekot tudod a stílót
Engem meg hívott meg az én barátom
A vaker itt prémium, marketing az 24 karátos
24 bomba, aranyalbum, veletek koccintani de jó
Arany a flow, töltsed a bort, a Kevin és LL Junior
Hiába mutatod nekem, hogy haverok vagyunk
De tudom hogy nem vagy az
Ugyanis most velem van a csaj, velem van a lé
Velem van a flow, te kimaradsz
És ha irigyek lennétek miránk, hát egyet mondhatok
Ingyen van a YouTube, ingyen van az út, szabad a mikrofon
Egy kicsit szétszórt, egy kicsit kótyagos
Szívemen vérfolt, de azért jól vagyok
Hűtlennek tűnhet, de sosem szívtelen
Megszeretek bárkit hirtelen és hogyha kell én továbbengedem

Csak járom az utcákat, egy csavargó vagyok, pont ahogyan rég
Ay, a-a-a-ay (Hey)

I just walk the streets, I'm a vagabond, just like I used to be
The night calls loudly every night
I light a cigarette and life is immediately beautiful
I don't like to be sober, the hallucinations are good

Ay, I know it's strange to you that I live so fast
Unfortunately, sober life eluded me even as a child
At least the wandering years didn't happen
I march up the mountain, I never stop until my blood boils

A little scattered, a little messy
There's blood on my heart, but I'm fine
You found me on the road
I'm going, I'm pulling my cart

I just walk the streets, I'm a vagabond, just like I used to be
The night calls loudly every night
I light a cigarette and life is immediately beautiful
I don't like to be sober, the hallucinations are good
You might also like
A wine and me, wandering on the ice of the lake
Good mood goes with me
Everything around us is snow white
Shit, life is a joke, everything bro is an illusion
Nothing is free, what's good
Trust me, it's an illusion
You just see it, but it's not there, you do it
You say it's forbidden
You love that I stoke the fire
I remained the same, those who know me know well
That I didn't kneel, but stood up from every failure

A little scattered, a little messy
There's blood on my heart, but I'm fine
You found me on the road
I'm going, I'm pulling my cart

I just walk the streets, I'm a vagabond, just like I used to be
The night calls loudly every night
I light a cigarette and life is immediately beautiful
I don't like to be sober, the hallucinations are good

You know the pace, you know the style
I was invited by my friend
Vaker is premium here, marketing is 24 carat
24 bombs, gold album, it's good to toast with you
The flow is golden, pour the wine, Kevin and LL Junior
It's no use showing me that we're friends
But I know you're not
Because now I have the girl, I have the juice
I'm in the flow, you're missing out
And if you were jealous of us, I can say one thing
YouTube is free, the road is free, the microphone is free
A little scattered, a little messy
There's blood on my heart, but I'm fine
He may seem disloyal, but he is never heartless
I fall in love with anyone suddenly and if necessary I will let them go

I just walk the streets, I'm a vagabond, just like I used to be
Ay, a-a-a-ay (Hey)
I light a cigarette and life is immediately beautiful
It's nice, it's fine

Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here...

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh!)
It's the return of the ""Oh, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said… nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Ha ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
""Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who,"" ""Yeah, but he's so cute though""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes—

Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn about a GRAMMY?

""But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?""
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh!)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me

I'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: ""How can kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, 'cause at the rate, I'm going, when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: ""How can kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, 'cause at the rate, I'm going, when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up

Krr, krr, krr

Születési évem '94
Anyád '92-ben megvolt a mosdóba', a Tescoban Szentendrén
A demokráciát csak úgy hívom „Szevasz báttya!”
Bár, ne ütött volna ennyire az apjára!
Mi ez a nagy lárma?
Ja, csak a Krúbi veri a farkát rá megin' egy vak lányra
(Á!)
Na figyelj már ide, te kutya!
Ilyen az élet, te kutya!
Üljél le szépen, te kutya!
Azt tűnjél el innen, te kutya!
Hozzad a botot, te kutya!
Az is a dolgod, te kutya!
Az anyád egy luvnya, már mindenki dugta
(Úgy van)

Az alakom mostanában nem olyan bomba
Rakódott egy kis zsírpárna a pocakomra
Bár ilyen étrend mellett nem is várok nagy csodákra
Minden este anyád punciját zabálom vacsorára
(Vú!)
Az aztán a kalória bomba
A szöveged az kamu, de valódi a gomba
Mi a farkamon át megfertőzött 120 lányt
A húgod nem győzi vakarni az ánuszát
(Krr)
Vasárnap egész este nála voltam
Aztán a gázra hazafele rátapostam
A jogsim oda, rendőr mondta „Party over”
Pedig én csak beálltam a parkolóba
Gimiben is így jártam, a tornasorba beálltam
Aztán magamat egyből az igazgatónál találtam
Még eljárást is indítottak, baszki
Pedig esküszöm a tanár mondta, hogy hozni kell tesire lasztit
Énekórán mindig kottán voltam
De az órákhoz jó párszor hozzászóltam
Mondtam „Hull a szilva a fáról, most jöttem az anyádtól
Sej-haj, ruca, ruca, kutya ribanc, nyeld le!”
Csak, ha beköltözhetek
Azt mondtam neki, „Persze
Nézd csak meg a Bodrit, ő is ott lakik a kertben!”
És full beleillene az új rappedbe
Figyeld meg!
(Vaú, vaú, vaú)

A bal herém az nagyobb, mint a jobb
És van, hogy reggelente szülészorvost hívok, mer' akkorát szarok
Nem mondhatjátok, lányok, hogy nem vágom, milyen szülni
De minden utódom vízbe fojtom, mer' rasszista vagyok
De amúgy vágyom már rá, hogy legyen egy gyerekem
Ha egyszer fehéret szarok, esküszöm, hogy felnevelem
Ketchup, mustár, gulyáskrém van a burgeremen
De tegnap csak egy banánt verettem a munkahelyemen
Az irodámban voltam
És miután benyomtam a banánomat, nyomban a kukáig elgyalogoltam
Magamban gondoltam: „csak úgy simán beledobjam
Vagy inkább legyek jó arc, vigyem ki a folyósóra?
Mer' ott kint is van egy szemetes
Ha bevonzza a legyeket, a banánhéj, az ne itt bent zavarja az embereket
Na mi legyen?
Á, tőlem a fegyelem az idegen
Kidobom, hazamegyek és kiverem
A Krúbi vagyok, mindenkit full leszarok
Krú-Krúbi vagyok, azt csinálok, amit akarok
De ahogy a kuka fölé hajolok, látom már van benne egy banán
Anyád, valaki nálam is lazább
Felkiáltok, hogy
»Ne!«”
Na milyen volt a sztori, tetszett?
Elpazaroltam vele életedből egy percet
De még ilyenkor is olyan forró a szövegem, hogy serceg
A 112-t csörgesd meg!
És mondjad be, hogy hallottál a Krúbitól egy rappet!
Rendőr, mentő, tűzoltó egyből megjelennek
De előbb a banánomról anyád véleményét is kérdezd meg!

Back, back, back

My year of birth is '94
Your mother was in the bathroom in '92, in Tesco in Szentendre
I just call democracy ""Goodbye brother!""
Although, he wouldn't have hit his father like that!
What's all the fuss about?
Yes, only the Krúbi beats his tail on a blind girl
(THE!)
Listen, you dog!
Such is life, you dog!
Sit down, you dog!
Get out of here, you dog!
Bring the stick, you dog!
That's your job, you dog!
Your mother is a Luvnya, everyone has already fucked her
(That's right)

My figure isn't so hot these days
I had a small fat pad on my belly
Although with such a diet, I don't expect great miracles
I eat your mother's pussy for dinner every night
(Whoah!)
That's the calorie bomb
Your text is bogus, but the mushroom is real
We infected 120 girls through my dick
Your sister can't stop scratching her anus
(Crr)
I was with him all Sunday night
Then I stepped on the gas on the way home
My legal sim over there, policeman said ""Party over""
I just pulled into the parking lot
I did the same in high school, I joined the gymnastics team
Then I immediately found myself with the director
They even filed a case, dammit
I swear, the teacher said that you have to bring laszti to tesira
I was always on sheet music in singing lessons
But I have commented on the classes quite a few times
I said ""Plums are falling from the tree, I just came from your mother
Sigh-hair, ruca, ruca, dog bitch, swallow it!”
Only if I can move in
I told him, “Sure
Just look at Bodri, he also lives there in the garden!""
And it would fit right into your new rap
Pay attention!

The left testicle is larger than the right
And sometimes I call an obstetrician in the morning because I'm such a jerk
You can't say, girls, that I don't know what it's like to give birth
But I'm drowning all my offspring because I'm a racist
But anyway, I already want to have a child
If I ever screw up a white person, I swear I'll raise it
I have ketchup, mustard and goulash cream on my burger
But yesterday I just smashed a banana at work
I was in my office
And after pushing my banana in, I immediately walked to the bin
I thought to myself: ""I'll just throw it in.""
Or should I be a good face and take him out on the river?
There's also a trash can outside
If the banana peel attracts the flies, don't bother the people in here
So what?
Ah, discipline is alien to me
I throw it away, go home and beat it
I'm the Krúbi, I'll fuck everyone
I'm a Krú-Krúbi, I do what I want
But as I lean over the bin, I see that there is already a banana in it
Your mother, someone is more relaxed than me
I exclaim that
""Not!""""
How was the story, did you like it?
I wasted a minute of your life with him
But even then, my text is so hot that it sizzles
Call 112!
And tell me that you heard a rap from Krúbi!
Police, ambulance and firemen will appear immediately
But first, ask your mother's opinion about my banana!

Amíg téged a család mindkét fele pénzel

Lе-le-leszakad a szív, mint a kantárszíj
Nem értеk haza pedig van házi
Ez nem a palotanegyed
Döngnek a falon a legyek
De tudod ahova megyek
Ott nagy a zaj
A hangom alanyi jogon
De végül hallani fogod
De várjál valaki kopog

I hate Off-White
They always bark, it's a dogfight
The eardrum ruptures
Your flow is cheap, this is topflight
I hate Off-White
They always bark, it's a dogfight
Why all the hype
You know you're fighting yourself, it's a boss fight

Fe-discover, up, up the hand, up
You're looking for light, but you're looking at the wrong side
E-I'll go to the market with half money
As long as you are funded by both sides of the family
Nyugati, Bajcsy, Andrássy
Co-cocaine, money, alimony
The heart breaks like a bridle strap
I can't get home and I have homework
This is not the palace quarter
The flies are buzzing on the wall
But you know where I'm going
There's a lot of noise there
My voice is a subject's right
But you will hear it eventually
But wait, someone knocks
Big trouble

You can lie, you sneeze at the truth
You've been doing well lately in rükvertz
Bittersweet prizes arranged by you
It's a thousand-year-old tradition (Conservative flash)
You don't go to the top, it's time to look around
Then the hebe-hesitation goes
You can take cover, my pike is razor sharp

Haha, DR BRS
Halott Pénz
És 20 év után a Fekete Vonat
Ez történelem
Rock The City, let's go

Újra reggel van, de te sajnos nem vagy itt velem
A szerelem messze szállt már, de téged őriz szívem
Semmi nem jó nélküled, mert már nem vagy az enyém
Megcsókolni újra a szád, oh bárcsak tehetném
Na gyere Beat, yo

Hol az, aki tiltja, hogy rám nézz
Ki az, aki tiltja, hogy megcsókolj (Megcsókolj)
Én tudom, hogy a szíved már másé
De az, amit én mondtam, az nem bók volt
Szívből szólt

Hol van az a lány, aki tudja
Hogy mitől lennék boldog újra
Hol van az a szép, ami nincs már
A szívem csak téged vár
Mindig ugyanúgy csak várlak
Én kеresnélek, de nеm talállak
Eljön az a nap, mikor itt leszel
És nem engedlek el

Sok lány van, de valahogy mégis túl kevés
Nem olyan a csók vagy nem igaz az ölelés
A szemed mindent elárul, ha titkolod, ha nem
Nekem kell, hogy felfedezzem
Hol van az lány, ki megtalál, ha elveszek
Majd felállít a padlóról, és önmagamhoz elvezet
Mert már mosolyogni akarok, nem problémát
Aki bár haragszik rám, mégis mellém áll

Hol az, aki tiltja, hogy rám nézz (Beat)
Ki az, aki tiltja, hogy megcsókolj (Újra megcsókolj)
Én tudom, hogy a szíved már másé
De az, amit én mondtam, az nem bók volt
Szívből szólt

Hol van az a lány, aki tudja
Hogy mitől lennék boldog újra
Hol van az a szép, ami nincs már
A szívem csak téged vár
Mindig ugyanúgy csak várlak
Én keresnélek, de nem talállak
Eljön az a nap, mikor itt leszel
És nem engedlek el
Ah, ah, haha
Hello édes, itt a DR BRS
A képed nem homályos, pont hogy éles
Emlékszem, kettesben maradtunk
És megtettünk mindent, amit akartunk
Te vagy az a lány, aki a túlparton áll
Átúszom érted a Balatont
Tombol a nyár, gyere ide már
Egy kicsit érezd a reggaetont
Amit érzek, túlmegy a szavakon
A falakon átmászva most megmutatom
Hogy akarom a szerelmed
Maratoni love story, 20 éve kereslek

Gyere vissza (Gyere vissza hozzám már)
Gyere vissza
Gyere vissza (Gyere vissza baby, kérlek már)
Gyere vissza
Gyere vissza (Gyere vissza)
Gyere vissza (Gyere vissza már)
Gyere vissza (Mindenki mondja, hol van az a lány)
Gyere vissza

Hol van az a lány, aki tudja
Hogy mitől lennék boldog újra
Hol van az a szép, ami nincs már
A szívem csak téged vár
Mindig ugyanúgy csak várlak
Én keresnélek, de nem talállak
Eljön az a nap, mikor itt leszel
És nem engedlek el
Hol van az a lány, aki tudja

Haha, DR BRS
Dead Money
And after 20 years, the Black Train
This is history
Rock The City, let's go

It's morning again, but unfortunately you're not here with me
Love is far away, but you are my heart
Nothing is good without you because you are no longer mine
To kiss your mouth again, oh I wish I could
Come on Beat, yo

Where is the one who forbids you to look at me
Who forbids you to kiss me (Kiss me)
I know your heart already belongs to someone else
But what I said was not a compliment
He spoke from the heart

Where is the girl who knows
What would make me happy again
Where is the beauty that is no longer there
My heart is waiting only for you
I always wait for you the same way
I would look for you, but I can't find you
The day will come when you will be here
And I won't let you go

There are many girls, but somehow too few
The kiss is not like that or the hug is not true
Your eyes tell everything if you hide it or not
I have to discover it
Where is the girl, who will find her if I get lost
Then he picks me up off the floor and leads me to myself
Because I want to smile, not a problem
Even though he is angry with me, he still stands by me

Where is the one who forbids you to look at me (Beat)
Who forbids you to kiss me (Kiss me again)
I know your heart already belongs to someone else
But what I said was not a compliment
He spoke from the heart

Where is the girl who knows
What would make me happy again
Where is the beauty that is no longer there
My heart is waiting only for you
I always wait for you the same way
I would look for you, but I can't find you
The day will come when you will be here
And I won't let you go
Ah, ah, haha
Hello honey, this is DR BRS
Your picture is not blurry, just sharp
I remember we were left alone
And we did everything we wanted
You are the girl standing on the other side
I will swim across Lake Balaton for you
Summer is coming, come here already
Feel a little reggaeton
What I feel is beyond words
Climbing over the walls, I'll show you now
How I want your love
Marathon love story, I've been looking for you for 20 years

Come back (Come back to me already)
come back
Come back (Come back baby please)
come back
Come back (Come back)
Come back (Come back already)
Come back (Everybody say where's that girl at)
come back

Now, now, now, now, don't call me up

Getting hot, losing control
You want me more now I let go

'Cause the truth is, without you, boy, I'm stronger
And I know you said that I changed with my cold heart
But it was your game that left scars
Ooh, I'm over you

Don't call me up

Feeling good now you're outta my life
Don't wanna talk about us
Gotta leave it behind

Csavarodok '22 szép tavaszán
És kérdezem, nálatok mér' szar a csár? (nálatok mér' szar a csár?)

Nem akarok soha többet szopni a raktárba
Adjatok egy mikrofont, kigyullad a hangkártya
Nem tudom, hogy mi van, nem is írok a naptárba
Meghallom a zenédet, kajak egy kalap trágya

Megint forog a világ, á-á-áh
Az a lány
Ha csak visszanézne rám

Térdem előtt az egész osztály
Csak tekerem a blázomat, bláz-bláz
Top csár
Csak heverek az ágyamon bye-bye
Mondd már
Miért hagyod a sztárokat árván
Voltál már itt és vágom, hogy láttál
Reggelre összeestünk, a haze szaga száll
Minek menjek haza, ha nincs aki hazavár?

Tudod bármit kapnék tőled én
Még nem állok készen, nézd ahogy élek!
Tudom, hogy már nem jön
Soha vissza nem élek a titkokkal
Csak ne merülj még nagyon bele, mert én
Hiába várok már rád!
Ha mindig lepereg csókod rólam és
Megin' elvesztem
Amire vágyom az hol van?
Hamar megöl a hiány

De túl lettem rajtad, te is túl lépsz majd úgy is
Bár tudnám

Merre jár az én babám!
Add a kezed, ne félj! (La-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba)
Túl sok árnyék tart feléd
Hadd legyek én neked a fény! (Hadd legyek a fény!)
Túl sok emlék szállt belém
Tudom ez nem is ez az élеt
Tudom, hogy már nem számít a szó
Tartsd magadban a téveszméd! (Téveszméd)

De csak a felét se láttad még
De csak a negyedén sem vagy túl
Lehet sosem lesz egész
Csak várod, hogy a maradék éjjelt is ébren töltsem
A Hold nem vár
Lehet lehetek más, csak egy kicsikét várj!
De ne te szólj rám!
Bár belemegyek megin' ugyanúgy
Várj meg míg megin' ugyanúgy…
Már nem engedem, bár hazahúz
Bár tudná már a világ ki is Azahriah!
Ayy, que todo será mejor mañana
Te vagy az egyetlen bűnöm
Hogy mindennap kivárom az éjszakát

You know, I would get anything from you
I'm not ready yet, watch me live!
I know he's not coming anymore
I never abuse secrets
Just don't dive in too much yet, because I do
I'm waiting for you in vain!
If you always give me butterfly kisses and
I'm lost again
Where is what I want?
The lack will soon kill you

But I'm over you, you'll get over it anyway
I wish I could

Where is my baby going!
Give me your hand, don't be afraid! (La-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba)
There are too many shadows headed your way
Let me be your light! (Let me be the light!)
Too many memories came flooding back
I know this is not life
I know the word doesn't matter anymore
Keep your delusion to yourself! (delusion)

Maybe you feel it's hard
But you haven't seen the half of it yet
But you're not even a quarter of the way through
It may never be whole
You're just waiting for me to spend the rest of the night awake
The moon does not wait
I can be different, just wait a little bit!
But don't tell me!
Although I'll go in again the same way
Wait until it's the same again...
I won't let him go, even though he's pulling me home
If only the world knew who Azahriah was!
Ayy, que todo será mejor mañana
You are my only sin
That I wait for the night every day
Just to see how—

Where is my baby going?

'Cause sometimes you just feel tired
Yo, left, yo, left
Feel weak and when you feel weak
Yo, left, right, left
You feel like you wanna just give up
Yo, left, yo left
But you gotta search within you
Yo, left, right, left
Try to find that inner strength and just pull that shit out of you
Yo, left, yo left
And get that motivation to not give up
Yo, left, right, left
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad
Yo, left, yo left
You wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse
Yo, left, right, left

'Til I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
‘Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fa' shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up

This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes: Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
André from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me

I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse

Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
‘Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
‘Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so

If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
‘Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
‘Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so

Túl sok a fasz, akik mondják, hogy túl nagy a face, face, face, face

Ez van, le se szarom, már voltam ott, ahova te mész...
Nem kell rappelnem, már megvan a pénz, megvan a pénz!
De csak, hogy bele ne haljak, valamit be hogy valljak:
Az van amit akarok: fiatal vagyok es gazdag
Bebasztam az ajtót, dik mi a fasz, megjottem, dik mi a fasz?!
Tíz év - rég top ez a team kiakaszt, megmondtam szívd ki a faszt
Több lett a gond - de több lett a pénz
Azt hiszik tudjak hogy ki vagyok, mindenki néz, mindenki néz, mindenki néz

Ami volt, elmúlt, nem számít, rég volt, de már minden más itt
Dolgozok, beszedek sok gázsit, túl magas vagyok hozzád, hozz sámlit
Újra eldobnék bármit, еngem ez a sok pénz csábít
Hogyha azt hiszed, csak az arcom nagy, kérdеzd meg a barátnődet, hogy miért sántít!
Leszarom, lehet utálni tesó
Én leróttam a büntetésem, úgy már minden jó
Próbálják páran, de sehol nem tudják ilyen jól
Csak ez a pénz, pénz, pénz , pénz - kurvák mindenhol!

There are too many people who say that face, face, face, face is too big

That's it, don't give a shit, I've been there where you're going...
I don't need to rap, I've got the money, I've got the money!
But just so I don't die, I have something to confess:
I have what I want: I am young and rich
I kicked in the door, what the hell, I got drunk, what the hell?!
Ten years - it's been a long time, this team is killing me, I told you to fuck off
There were more problems - but more money
They think I know who I am, everyone is watching, everyone is watching, everyone is watching

What was is gone, it doesn't matter, it was a long time ago, but everything is different here
I work, I take a lot of gas, I'm too tall for you, bring a stool
I'd throw anything away again, I'm tempted by all this money
If you think my face is just big, ask your girlfriend why she limps!
Shit, you can hate me bro
I served my punishment, so everything is fine

None of these toys on lease too, ah
Made your whole year in a week too, yah
Main bitch outta your league too, ah
Side bitch outta your league too, ah
House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table, cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby, ah
You talkin' money, need a hearin' aid
You talkin' 'bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain

Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'

Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no ""Mrs.""
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches

I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today, I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around

And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do

Olyan kicsi a világ
Érezd a nagyod
Első gyermek lett a nővérem a második meg halott
És a harmadik én vagyok
Akinek ragyog
Az élete, de mostanában sok hideget kapok

Gyere megmutatom hogyan nőhet virág kínok alatt
Én itt teremtem meg minden nap a világszínvonalat
A hajléktalantól indulok a rezidenciákig
Kattog a gyerek, dik mi ez a sok epilepsziás itt?
A levegőt kiskoromban felváltotta a kendergőz
Óvakodj a rappemtől (Előbb utóbb megfertőz)
Maradék cashből veszek konzervet, piát
Én ilyen vagyok nehezen vonok le konzekvenciát
A spanomnak lehúzták tegnapelőtt kajakra a full csárját
Holnap majd elveszem a köcsögtől a cashét meg a dupláját
Cigány húzzál rá
Mer' hogyha lemegyek citybe én nulla cashből teremtem meg húsz árát
Ilyen vagyok
Kiszámíthatatlan
Annyi adagot kell eladjak mi kiszállíthatatlan
De gyere be
Vége az eleje

Te buta maradsz, amíg a művészet minden ágazatában növekedik nálam a repertoár
A narkotikum épül, a vész neve elnézve
A délutáni spuri képbe tesz estére
A reggeli sör amit bontok haver
Engem le rombolt a szer, mi a faszt rontottam el?
Dehát kétszer körbe veri a szöveg a kerületet
Sötétedés után veszik fel a szemüveget
Három sorom után lövik oda nekem azt, hogy de brutál
Nálatok egy track, amíg nálunk egy album debütál
Bejöttem a képbe egyből összes geci fakul
Idősebb vagy? Én pedig a technikai bravúr
Hogy miér'? Kajak nem tudom az okát

The world is so small
Feel your big
My sister became the first child, the second died
And the third is me
To whom it shines
It's his life, but I've been getting a lot of colds lately

Come, I'll show you how a flower can grow under pain
I create the world class here every day
I start from the homeless to residences
The child clicks, dik, why are there so many epileptics here?
The air was replaced by hemp vapor when I was young
Beware of my rap (Sooner or later it'll infect you)
I buy canned goods and booze with leftover cash
I'm like that, I have a hard time drawing conclusions
The day before yesterday, my span had its full tank removed for kayaking
Tomorrow I will take the cash and double from the bastard
You're a gypsy
I daresay if I go down to the city, I will create twenty prices from zero cash
I'm so
Unpredictable
I have to sell so many portions that we can't deliver
But come in
The beginning is over
Mer, my mother doesn't know where her child is for about three weeks, heh

Kayak, did you dare to do it with me?
We've been brothers for 15 years, but you dare to do this to me?

Listen when I come, you bastard
Patriotism is the intellectual who knows what to rap about
You will remain stupid while my repertoire in all branches of art grows
The narcotic is built, looking at the name of the disaster
The afternoon spur sets you up for the evening
The morning beer that I open, man
The drug destroyed me, what the hell did I do?
However, the text goes around the perimeter twice
The glasses are put on after dark
After three lines, they throw me the word de brutál
You have one track while we have an album debut
I came into the picture and all the cum fades away
Are you older? And I'm the technical feat
What for? Kayak I don't know the reason
I didn't deal with a verse of Mer' for more than five minutes (Se, he)Embed",hu,"{'second', 'album', 'shine', 'looking', 'perimeter', 'dik', 'patriotism', 'epileptic', 'residence', 'price', 'away', 'daresay', 'weve', 'listen', 'yesterday', 'narcotic', 'replaced', 'homeless', 'set', 'debut', 'line', 'picture', 'fade', 'rap', 'tomorrow', 'first', 'canned', 'verse', 'minute', 'sooner', 'class', 'sell', 'deal', 'vapor', 'glass', 'good', 'brutál', 'mer', 'hemp', 'remain', 'track', 'small', 'beware', 'later', 'mother', 'zero', 'intellectual', 'lyric', 'leftover', 'grow', 'child', 'bastard', 'buy', 'grows', 'deliver', 'drug', 'tank', 'hell', 'cash', 'morning', 'pain', 'beginning', 'name', 'stupid', 'third', 'technical', 'man', 'kayak', 'afternoon', 'week', 'repertoire', 'click', 'throw', 'built', 'text', 'became', 'world', 'heh', 'drawing', 'branch', 'destroyed', 'sister', 'gypsy', 'around', 'beer', 'kayaking', 'dark', 'disaster', 'however', 'three', 'cold', 'evening', 'cum', 'older', 'infect', 'dare', 'big', 'conclusion', 'time', 'booze', 'many', 'span', 'brother', 'show', 'reason', 'full', 'young', 'chicken', 'life', 'word', 'create', 'art', 'hard', 'twenty', 'flower', 'five', 'unpredictable', 'open', 'twice', 'double', 'lot', 'year', 'lately', 'contributorsghetto', 'removed', 'portion', 'spur', 'start', 'air', 'died', 'city'}"

I was born three-six-seventy-two, I think it's on a Wednesday
Hail to the moon, just like Kunta Kinte
That means I'm gifted from the get-go, Mom's you never let go
Mad thanks for raising me right, bro
You gave me confidence to stop the nonsense
Didn't live in Bel Air like the Fresh Prince
Times are hard, times are rough
Didn't have Toys 'R' Us toys, but I had enough love
Plus the guidance from above
To go to the park, sweatin', push and shove
Maybe then for a dunk like you told me
Then there were a few times when Dad had to scold me
Prayed for my safety, I know how you was feeling
Didn't want me wheeling and get to drug-dealing
Remember when you asked me this one day
Who I wanna be like, I said Dr. J
Then you said, ""Good, now you gotta go
Take the damn ball and slam it through the hole""
Mom cracked a smile, Daddy gave a frown
I said to myself, ""I can't let them down""
So make way, I'm coming in for a landing
And nothing's gonna' stop me, from being outstanding

I'm outstanding

Now let's skip to the time when I was fifteen
Shaq is in the house, no, Shaq is on the scene
Now my name's in papers, girls caught the vapors
Kids look up to me like a skyscraper
Now, a role model, I mean a role figure
Then I ask myself, can I get any bigger?
My dream is coming true, but coming true slowly
Then I remember what Mom and Dad told me
""Remember this, son, you are the one
Shoot your gift like a gun and never forget where you come from
You're young, gifted, and Black
If they can't say Shaquille O'Neal then make 'em scream, Shaq!'""
Like the fam do, in the stands too
When I freak the funk on a dunk they, ""Ah! Ooh!""
From high school to college, they gave me enough knowledge
Make that gift and now it's time for me to fulfill my dream
To be in the  like Hakeem
I'll make the backboards shatter
Fans chit-chatter
Even make the other centers get madder
That's me, who can it be?
The master of disaster, seven foot three
Brother, ain't no other in the nation
I'm born from my mother but I'm God's creation
I'm outstanding
I'm outstanding

Cause now I'm outstanding
Wave your hands and pump your fist
When I'm on the court you know it's strictly, ""Swish!""
Cause there's some things that I gotta do:
Tape up the ankle, pump up my Shaq shoe
And now it's time to take care of business
To run up and down the court with Nick and Dennis
Scott, but I won't stop
Gotta keep striving until I reach the top
Gonna take a peek over the mountain
I flow like a fountain
Peace, I gotta go! And I'm out and…
But before I go, wave your hands
Peace to all my family, friends and fam

Tudom probléma vagyok, de ők nem tudnak megoldani
A tüzet, ami bennem, még nem tudják eloltani

Drasztikusan csökken a kihívók száma
És mostanság folyton a dráma
Csak az, amit én hallok, de leszarom
Mert úgy pattog a csaj rajtam
Mint egy akrobata, akit karácsonyra kaptam
A barátnőd az estét nálam tölti
Vicces, hogy közben mégis a te pénzedet költi
De hetek óta nem alhat veled
Vakmeleg, ahogy rázza az ágyban
Azt kéri, hogy ne hagyjam abba
Hogy üssem bátran a…
Vakmeleg a hangulat a lakásban
A csajt azt leküldtem a boltba
Mert szóda van még, de elfogyott a vodka
A házam egy kocsma, a lányok haja copfban
De ne gondolj rosszra, a kedvem nem rontja еl semmi
Egy biztos, ma meg fogok menni

Tudom probléma vagyok, dе ők nem tudnak megoldani

Gyere rám, ez így jó, gyere ráérek most hajnalig
Baby, te vagy ma este a harmadik
Ja, csak jussunk el az asztalig
Azt akarom hallani
Tututu tututu
Túl szép, túl jó, ne hagyd abba
Üss bátran
Vakmeleg, ahogy rázza az ágyban
Utána meg a kádban a nyelved a számban
Most csináljuk hárman ha kell
Itt nincs habiszti vaker
Zsigerből zseni, vagyok ő is tudja
A fejét nekem teszi
Közben a ruháját szedi fel a földről
Én meg bealszok a zöldtől

I know I'm a problem, but they can't solve it
They can't put out the fire in me yet

The number of challengers is drastically reduced
And now it's all drama
Just what I hear, but I'll screw it up
Because the girl jumps on me
Like an acrobat I got for Christmas
Your girlfriend is spending the evening at my place
It's funny how he spends your money in the process
But he hasn't been able to sleep with you for weeks
He's blindly hot as he shakes her in bed
He asks me not to stop
How to bravely hit the…
The atmosphere in the apartment is blindingly warm
I sent the girl down to the store
Because there is still soda, but the vodka is gone
My house is a pub, the girls' hair is in pigtails
But don't think bad, nothing spoils my mood
One thing is for sure, I will go today

I know I'm a problem, but they can't solve it
They can't put out the fire in me yet

Tutu tutu tutu
Too good, too good, don't stop
Feel free to hit
He's blindly hot as he shakes her in bed
After that, your tongue in my mouth in the tub
Now the three of us do it if we have to
There is no habeas corpus here
He knows that I am a genius from the gut
He gives me his head
Meanwhile, he picks up his clothes from the floor
Green makes me sleepy

I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard

I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think

My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's comin' from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter

I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter

You broke me first

Maybe you don't like talking too much about yourself
But you shoulda told me that you were thinking 'bout someone else
You're drunk at a party or maybe it's just that your car broke down
Your phone's been off for a couple of months, so you're calling me now
I know you, you're like this
When shit don't go your way, you needed me to fix it
And like me, I did
But I ran out of every reason

Now suddenly, you're asking for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first
You broke me first

Took a while, was in denial when I first heard
That you moved on quicker than I could've ever, you know that hurt
Swear for a while, I would stare at my phone just to see your name
But now that it's there, I don't really know what to say

Ha a zene nagyon hangos
Gyere vegyük kicsit halkabbra
Még nem döntöttem el azt, hogy
Kivel leszek hajnalba
Ahogy felkel a nap, épp hogy látom a tested
Én egész életemben ezt kerestem
Ez lesz a vesztem, csak el ne vesszek
A nedvedben, hadd járják még a kedvedben
Egy óra van még hátra a rodeóra
Csak ketten, meg egy kicsi móka
Nem volt pihi már a Misi óta
Azóta rejtély, hogy miért álltál pont ott
Hesszelnek lányok a pezsgőmet bontom
Tudom hívod már a Boltot
De most figyelj ide, mondom
Aludtam sok ágyban, álmodtam sokat
Belülről is hidd el, láttam másokat
Sok ember táncolt itt, láttam és mondták
Nincs hozzád hasonló, kimondhatom már

I talk about you too much
I always regret it later
Just don't let tomorrow come
Just don't let tomorrow come
Be me when someone is at fault
I'll pour your drink if there's an affinity
One more round just for you
You've been begging me to make music for a long time
Come with me if I do wrong
This evening may bring more than that
Come, the night is waiting for us
The night is upon us, yeah
When I'm with you, you know, there's always confusion
I smell it - just a blue Zara
I'm running away from you, baby, you're not going home today, are you?
The way you look at me is so beautiful
Don't be sorry, hey baby I enjoy it

Music on max, full room can go, let it play
I warm your waist, you sleep with me today
You know how Crisy Danger is when she has two beers
Come with me a little later

Look at this girl, hey what she generates
Your mouth can't fit, hey-hey come at me
Let the flame burn - I through everything
I already know your lips on my lips
No rest, ready
It's unbelievable, I don't understand either
But before you ask, hey
I would imagine such a woman
Look at this girl, hey what she generates
Your mouth can't fit, hey-hey come at me
Let the flame burn - I through everything
I already know your lips on my lips
No rest, ready
It's unbelievable, I don't understand either
But before you ask, hey
I would imagine such a woman

If the music is very loud
Let's take it a little quieter
I haven't decided yet
Who will I be with in the morning?
As the sun rises, I can just see your body
I've been looking for this all my life
This will be my loss, just don't lose it
In your juice, let them go as you please
There's an hour left in the rodeo
Just the two of us and a little fun
He hasn't had a party since Mass
Since then, why you were standing there has been a mystery
I break my champagne for Hesszel girls
I know you are already calling Bolt
But listen now, I say
I slept in many beds, I dreamed a lot
Believe me from the inside, I've seen others
Many people danced here, I saw and they said
There is no one like you, I can tell

Music on max, full room can go, let it play
I warm your waist, you sleep with me today
You know how Crisy Danger is when she has two beers
Come with me a little later
Look at this girl, hey what she generates

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
'Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long that
Even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how ya talkin' and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke, fool
I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the streetlight

We've been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We've been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise

Look at the situation they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the state
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watchin' got me chasin' dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
And my homies is down, so don't arouse my anger, fool
Death ain't nothin' but a heartbeat away
I'm livin' life do-or-die, what can I say?
I'm 23 now, but will I live to see 24?

I'll make the other Vault Hunters look like wannabes
That's probably why your daughters are in love with me
I'm slaughtering anyone who tries to walk on me
Like a Thresher who gets ya comin' up from underneath
It isn't hard to see why you cannot believe
When I tell you guardian angels can talk to me
Here's a coffin, I build them often
My enemies end up in these when they stop respondin’
Targets drop quick, I’m a hardened marksman
You're the country bumpkin who can hardly function

You can talk the talk, but can you walk the walk?
You’d better know when you come into town
It's a dog-eat-dog kinda life we live
That's why you never let your guard fall down
Sleep with one eye open, boy, or you'll never wake up again
If you find good loot, then get ready to shoot
’Cause in the Borderlands, you have no friends

You gotta gra-gr-gra-gr-grab dat loot (Grab dat loot)
Nee-ne-nee-ne-need dat loot (Need dat loot)
Kee-ke-kee-ke-keep dat loot (Keep dat loot)
Dat loot, dat loot, dat loot
(2x)

Pucker up, buttercup and kiss my ass
I'm talkin' lips to crack, can you handle that?
Handsome Jack, while your at it, lick my sack
It's not a lot to ask, in fact, a simple task
Or I can splatter your guts with a custom grenade
Bombin' your base (yup), that'll have you palmin' your face
Poppin' skulls like an ace, critical hit to the brains
And if your head grows back, I'll have you covered in flames (Spit it)

They just call it war, but I'm just havin' fun
When you were playin' with toys, I was playin' with guns
You think you finished them off? Punk, you've only begun
I got 99 problems and a Skag ain't one

I got 99 problems
Pro-pr-prob-problems
99 problems, Skag ai-ain't one
If you havin' pest problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a Skag ain't one
(2x)
Axton, Salvador, Zer0 and Maya
Got the motley crew to screw with every Goliath
Psychos can't even touch us and the midgets don't try to
Life is a race and look, everybody's behind us
My boy Krispy Kreme knows where I'm at
I got a pocket full of shells, you got a face full of gats
Hats off to me, the freakin' wasteland king
If you don't like how I talk, you can hear my gun sing

Don't need to warn you that around every corner
Waits another hostile attack
And need I remind you keep an eye out behind ya
Or you'll find a knife in your back
Only reason why you're never satisfied with the gun that you got right now
You know that somewhere in the desert, there's a gun that's even better
Just a-waitin' to be found

You gotta gra-gr-gra-gr-grab dat loot (Grab dat loot)
Nee-ne-nee-ne-need dat loot (Need dat loot)

That's just all he know, he don't know nothin' else
I tried to show 'em, yeah
I tried to show 'em, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Goin' on you with the pick and roll
Young La Flame, he in sicko mode

(Woo) Made this here with all the ice on in the booth
At the gate outside, when they pull up, they get me loose
Yeah, Jump Out boys, that's Nike boys, hoppin' out coupes
This shit way too big, when we pull up, give me the loot (Gimme the loot!)
Was off the Remy, had a Papoose
Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two-four hour lockdown, we made no moves
Now it's 4 AM and I'm back up poppin' with the crew
I just landed in, Chase B mixes pop like Jamba Juice
Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits
And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look at the five and ten
It's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

A pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

Csak tapadnak a jobbnál jobb
És szőke, barna fullos csajok
Mindegyikük egy kicsit botrányos
Mégis ma este is megint beindulok
Beléjük bolondulok
Tőlük nem szabadulok el többet
Úgyis mindig ugyanaz a vége
Nem hagyom félbe
Akármennyit fizetnek is érte

Mer' élvezem én ezt, édes a méreg
Tiszták a képek, szépek a színek
Hófehér szárnyakon vérvörös bélyeg
Amiket felfestettek az évek
Mocskosul táncba hívnak
És azt mondhatják, hogy maradj még
Közben rózsaszín magassarkúban
Rúzsban, jön a testbeszéd
Orrba, szájba, görbe tükör álca
Mégis belemegyеk, betöröm hátha
Kapok egy épkézláb választ már ma
Mit kéne nеkem tenni akkor, ha...

Csak tapadnak a jobbnál jobb
És szőke, barna fullos csajok
Mindegyikük egy kicsit botrányos
Mégis ma este is megint beindulok
Beléjük bolondulok
Tőlük nem szabadulok el többet

Éjjel kettő söröd van
Tűz piros szívem feldobban
Az éjszaka szürke színpadjára
De nagy kár, hogy sötét van
Túl régóta kevés a dal, meg a nóta
Kevés a hangja, hogy kapjon
Egy kis sárga szikrázó fényt
Az nem jöhet szóba
Pedig fullosan szívből nyomja
Úgy, mint Elvis a táncot tolja
Látja a vakon sikongató lányokat
Közeledni folyva
És máris meg van fogva ő
És nem tud dobbanni újra ő
És nem tud dobbanni újra ő, ha...

Csak tapadnak a jobbnál jobb
És szőke, barna fullos csajok
Mindegyikük egy kicsit botrányos
Mégis ma este is megint beindulok
Beléjük bolondulok
Tőlük nem szabadulok el többet
Úgyis mindig ugyanaz a vége
Nem hagyom félbe
Akármennyit fizetnek is érte
Az ami száll egyszer majd földet ér
A pillanat nem tart örökké
Tudok valamit ami többet ér
És tudok valakit aki többet ér

Már nem tapadnak a jobbnál jobb
És szőke, barna fullos csajok
Mindegyikük botrányos
De itt van ő és érte beindulok
Csak belé bolondulok
Tőle nem szabadulok el többet
Úgyis mindig ugyanaz a vége
Nem hagyom téve

They only stick to the best
And blonde, brunette full girls
All of them are a bit scandalous
I'll start again tonight though
I'm crazy about them
I won't get rid of them anymore
It always ends the same anyway
I won't let it go
No matter how much they pay for it

I'm enjoying this, poison is sweet
The pictures are clear, the colors are beautiful
Blood-red mark on snow-white wings
Which the years have painted
They invite me to dirty dance
And they can tell you to stay
Meanwhile in pink high heels
Lipstick on, body language is coming
Nose, mouth, curved mirror mask
I'll go in anyway, I'll break in just in case
I'll get a straight answer today
What should I do if...

They only stick to the best
And blonde, brunette full girls
All of them are a bit scandalous
I'll start again tonight though
I'm crazy about them
I won't get rid of them anymore
It always ends the same anyway
I won't let it go
No matter how much they pay for it

You have two beers at night
My fire-red heart soars
To the gray stage of the night
Too bad it's dark
There have been too few songs and notes for too long
He has little voice to receive
A little yellow sparkling light
That's out of the question
He pushes it with all his heart
Like Elvis pushing the dance
He sees the blindly screaming girls
Approaching
And he's already caught
And he can't roll again
And he can't roll again if...

They only stick to the best
And blonde, brunette full girls
All of them are a bit scandalous
I'll start again tonight though
I'm crazy about them
I won't get rid of them anymore
It always ends the same anyway
I won't let it go
No matter how much they pay for it
What flies will eventually hit the ground
The moment doesn't last forever
I know something worth more
And I know someone worth more

They no longer stick to better than better
And blonde, brunette full girls
All of them are scandalous
But he's here and I'm starting for him
I'm just crazy about it
I won't get rid of him anymore

I fell by the wayside like everyone else
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, but I was just kidding myself
Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone, all I hear are the words that I needed to say

When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal, but this won't

So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'da known you had a storm to weather
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So before you go

Was never the right time whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face

160,160,160,Follow The Flow,Anyám mondta,"1 ContributorAnyám mondta Lyrics
Nem akartam rommá menni, egy életet mulattam át
Sokszor próbáltam jobbá lenni, de a szenvedély az utamba állt
Hiába mondják, hogy lassítsak, mert a sírba vezet ez az életvitel
Mégis bekötött szemmel nyomom a gázt, mert az életet valahogy élvezni kell
Ismerem az értékeket, de a mértéket nem, és ez tesz tönkre
Pihennem kell, de mit tegyek Anya? Hogyha engem a nyugalom nem köt le
Kis gyerek kis baj, nagy gyerek nagy, velem együtt a gondok is felnőttek
Majd kiderül az ég, de ha szivárványt szeretnék, számítani kell a felhőkre

Anyám mindig, óvott féltett
És igaza volt, nem játék az élet
Fiam, magad ellen nincsen orvosságod
Ezért kerül el a boldogság
Anyám mindig óva intett
Hogy soha ne vegyek magamra mindent
De Anya, magam ellen nincsen orvosságom
Ezért kerül el a boldogság

Anyu, Anyu mondd, miért szül a baj még több bajt?
Ha kitartok, könnyebb lesz majd?
Hogy legyek mindig jó, hogy ne ártsak másnak?
Ha magamnak is rossz vagyok társnak
Mikor múlt el az a perc, ami számított?
Mikor azt hittem, a csodára várni jobb
Miért van az, hogy a barátból ellenség lesz?
És a pénz csak éhessé tesz
Miért én maradtam alul, hogyha felvettem a kesztyűt?
Magam hajszoltam hasztalanul, hosszú éveknek lett ez a vesztük
Az életem csak én menthetem meg, lehet, pont én vagyok minden válasz
Ha a józan ésszel szembemegyek, tudom akkor is megbocsátasz

I didn't want to go to waste, I was enjoying a life
I tried to be better many times, but passion got in my way
In vain they tell me to slow down, because this way of life leads to the grave
Still, I step on the gas blindfolded, because life has to be enjoyed somehow
I know the values, but not the measure, and that ruins me
I need to rest, but what should I do, Mom? If I am not bound by peace
A small child is a small problem, a big child is big, the problems have grown up with me
The sky will be clear, but if you want a rainbow, you have to count on the clouds

My mother always scared me
And he was right, life is not a game
My son, you have no remedy against yourself
That is why happiness eludes me
My mother always warned me
To never take on everything
But Mother, I have no medicine against myself
That is why happiness eludes me

Mom, Mom, tell me, why does trouble beget more trouble?
If I persevere, will it get easier?
How can I always be good so that I don't harm others?
If I am also a bad partner
When did the minute that mattered pass?
When I thought it was better to wait for a miracle
Why is it that a friend becomes an enemy?
And money only makes you hungry
Why was I left behind when I put on the gloves?
I chased it myself to no avail, it was their loss for many years
Only I can save my life, maybe I am the answer
If I go against common sense, I know you will forgive me

Your word is forbidden, but I will continue anyway
I just wouldn't be so self-absorbed
Trouble is looking for you, you always said
It's never too late, it's never too late

My mother always scared me
And he was right, life is not a game
My son, you have no remedy against yourself

Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah

Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed

But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got

To go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot

You prolly think that you are better now, better now

Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything

Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head

Szia, bébi
Azt mondtad egyszer úgyis leszek valaki

Kereslek lány
Kerestem már
Dombokon át
Hegyeken át
Elmúlt a nyár
Elmúlt a vágy
Keresem a kezedet mert olyan puha, lágy
Kék szemed csillog rám, megtaláltam a kezedet
Megláttalak akkor és elvesztettem az eszemet
Fénylő ruhád csillog rám a kocsi ablakán
Megterítettem neked a szívem asztalán
Hol van az ágy?
Amit ide sodor a tеnger
Az a lány
Ki mindig feldobja a kedvеm
Hazavár
És velem van minden ember
Ez a lány

Azt mondták az idő tenger, nekem nagyon mély a víz
Azt mondtad, hogy keresel még de így is csak néha hívsz
Egy millió szempár között is látom a tiédet
Soha nem volt sok mindenem de minden a tiéd lett

Mély szakadék van a lábam alatt
Minden érzésem, végül árva marad
Egyszer mindet elásom, majd a váram alatt
Akármit éreztem az majd hátramarad
Kicsi a világ bébi
Kincseket csinálsz és itt
Nincsenek viták bébi
Nincsenek viták bébi
Azt mondták egyszer majd én is leszek valaki
Kell mellém egy lány aki végig a szívemben lakik
Tudom, hogy káros és tudom, hogy fáj
De tudod jól, hogy álmosan is azt adom át

Azt mondták az idő tenger, nekem nagyon mély a víz
Azt mondtad, hogy keresel még de így is csak néha hívsz
Egy millió szempár között is látom a tiédet
Soha nem volt sok mindenem de minden a tiéd lett
Azt mondták az idő tenger, nekem nagyon mély a víz
Azt mondtad, hogy keresel még de így is csak néha hívsz
Egy millió szempár között is látom a tiédet
Soha nem volt sok mindenem de minden a tiéd lett
Mikor üres a pohár csak akkor fáj
Csak akkor érzem mikor hozzáér a számEmbed","2 ContributorsTenger Lyrics
Hello Baby
You said I'd be somebody one day anyway

I'm looking for you girl
I already searched
Over hills
Through mountains
Summer is gone
The desire is gone
I'm looking for your hand because it's so soft, so soft
Your blue eyes shine on me, I found your hand
I saw you then and lost my mind
Your shiny dress shines at me through the car window
I have spread the table of my heart for you
where is the bed
What the sea throws here
That girl
Who always cheers me up
Waiting for home
And all the people are with me
This girl

They said time is a sea, for me the water is very deep
You said you're still looking, but you still only call sometimes
I can see yours in a million pairs of eyes
I never had much, but everything became yours
You might also like
Everything became yours
Oh, it's all yours
Everything became yours
Oh, it's all yours

There is a deep chasm under my feet
All my feelings will eventually be orphaned
I'll bury them all at once, then under my castle
Whatever I felt will be left behind
It's a small world baby
You make treasures and here
No arguments baby
No arguments baby
They said that one day I would be somebody
I need a girl by my side who lives in my heart all the time
I know it's harmful and I know it hurts
But you know very well that I give it to you sleepily

They said time is a sea, for me the water is very deep
You said you're still looking, but you still only call sometimes
I can see yours in a million pairs of eyes
I never had much, but everything became yours
They said time is a sea, for me the water is very deep
You said you're still looking, but you still only call sometimes
I can see yours in a million pairs of eyes
I never had much, but everything became yours
It only hurts when the glass is empty
I only feel it when the track touches Embed",hu,"{'desire', 'time', 'pair', 'treasure', 'shine', 'mind', 'dress', 'searched', 'mountain', 'looking', 'lost', 'throw', 'cheer', 'call', 'castle', 'harmful', 'hurt', 'sleepily', 'feeling', 'chasm', 'argument', 'sea', 'life', 'glass', 'soft', 'blue', 'became', 'waiting', 'bury', 'world', 'foot', 'water', 'gone', 'hello', 'track', 'small', 'side', 'eventually', 'felt', 'car', 'spread', 'eye', 'hand', 'left', 'well', 'whatever', 'lyric', 'found', 'behind', 'anyway', 'orphaned', 'bed', 'empty', 'touch', 'people', 'girl', 'hill', 'saw', 'deep', 'window', 'home', 'summer', 'contributorstenger', 'heart', 'million', 'shiny', 'table'}"

You say you love me, I say you crazy
We're nothing more than friends
You're not my lover, more like a brother
I known you since we were like ten, yeah

Don't mess it up, talking that shit
Only gonna push me away, that's it!
When you say you love me, that make me crazy
Here we go again

Don't go look at me with that look in your eye
You really ain't going away without a fight
You can't be reasoned with, I'm done being polite

It starts with one
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time, all I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, d-didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go

I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all

Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before

Not that you knew me back then

Everybody's lookin' for a come up

Meus surtos, mulheres e drogas
Família, visão e apostas
E a minha quadrilha assume o topo do game, irmão (1Kilo)
Meus surtos, mulheres e drogas
Família, visão e apostas
E a minha quadrilha assume o topo do game, irmão (1Kilo)

Pop tipo tu? Pop tipo eu
Popstar, rockstar
Motherfuckin' starboy
Playboy, bandido artista
Mas se encontrar na pista o conceito é o mesmo
Eu tô bem, tipo Cobain
Punk tipo Daft Punk, tipo Death Note
Funk tipo Marcinho, não
Tipo passinho dos Hawaianos
Vem que vem que vem quicando
1Kilo rouba a cena, o mundo é nosso
E pode ir se acostumando
DJ Grego é referência
Filha da puta nunca cansa de matar a concorrência
Vivendo o plano do século
E os que desacreditaram estão dormindo com os tubérculo
Meus vícios me dão hype
Devolvo toda energia ruim num kamehameha
Kamehamehype
Quem me errar morreu
E até agora nenhum deles conseguiu me acertar, ok?

Mil tipos de fazer essa gata vir comigo
Tomo tua banca, o pó que tu panca
Só pra servir de aprendizado, melhor tu ser amigo
1Kilo que sobe nunca vai cair
Psiu, se ilude não
Pra quem quer Ibope, nós ta nem aí
Surfa no hype, tiozão
Yeah, só penso na minha grana
E na seleção da mina semanal, yeah
Sete shows por semana
É tanta mina gata que ta faltando pau, yeah

Somos reis sem leis, sonhos sem vez
Ruas sem sono como em LA, ei
Um disco, seis dígitos em um mês
Primavera é grana e o inverno fica pra vocês, né
Outro ano e eu tô aqui
Vim, vi e venci o inferno sem cair
Deixa eles falar que eu mudei por subir
Cada verso é um drive by tipo goodbye to my enemies, uou
Hennessy e kush, estilo good life
1Kilo e foda-se o que eles falem
Dobra a aposta caso eu bata a cota
Costa a costa, quando toca nego sabe que o mano still fly
Cali style, low rider e um double cup
Se perguntar, ninguém sabe o que houve, woop woop
Reds & blues
Tô com a gata mais gangsta de norte a sul
Eu voltei flow Cristiano
Quem me queria pobre ficou triste esse ano
Acorda, Chris, o tempo tá passando, ahn, ahn
E o ""Bavi""  tá me chamando
Eu já falei: meu bonde é só jogador caro
Onde passa para a city, vish, vai descer do carro
Terror deles, sonho delas, toda noite meu direct chove
Avisei que era melhor não se  envolver
Nem sei por que tem quem se envolve
Eternizo minha cara em cada verso
Camarim parece convento das miss universo
Nem pra perdoar esses cara eu peço
Me critica e a tua mina pagando ingresso pra me ver
Liga o autotune, DJ Grego, pra falarem e eu só responder:
""Aham, aham""

E um pombo que fala pru
Ei Xamãzin
Separei essa parte pra tu mandar um passin'
Segredo é a respiração
Ei, cê lembra que
Eu vi um filme de um cara que era MC
Que tinha um tio de um cara lá de Muriqui
Um tiro, um tiro, 1Kilo, vaza, aqui não é bem assim
DoisP tá ali metendo bala, bala Hennessy
Dois peito ali meter na sala, fala safadinho
De stylefree Guadalajara cara selavi
BG me filma, 1Kilo Prada, vários hitzim
Xamã no brilho, cara, como assim?
Ela foi pelada no camarim
A mina ga-ga-gaga falou pra mim
Que me ama-ma-mava no sapatin'

Bota na conta do papai
O que eu quiser, eu tenho
O que que cê quiser, eu tenho
Pode avisar lá que o baile é nosso (avisa)
É que de onde eu venho, eu boto marra mesmo, eu posso
Qualquer problema desenrola com papai
Virei top ranking, assaltante de cena
Cabeça cara, nome mais pedido da pista
Baviera virou playboy
Tu já viu playboy morar no morro?
Bandido artista
Baby hasta la vista
Sou meu próprio socorro, hoje eu canto e pago à vista
Onde eu chego, eu paro tudo
E ela me olha e nem pisca

Peita ou respeita, é a tropa do padrinho
Exército da 1Kilo, DJ Grego general
Metemo pé na porta, tocamo terror na cena
Pronto pra estragar tua festa em território nacional
Samuel Rosa queimando, tamo portando refrigerante de malandro
Nosso bonde no palco são vários MC's voando, literalmente falando
Tamo na boca do povo, aceita que dói menos
Enquanto vocês só falam, nós tamo fazendo
Quer mandar jab, indireta com essas rimas mais ou menos
Tenta a sorte, vai acabar morrendo
A cara do recalque, deixa esses merda chorar
Porque é nós que tamo em primeiro lugar
Igual Iori incorporado do Flipper
Groupies tentando abrir o meu zíper
Vocês querem mesmo tentar contra o bonde?
Vão acabar com os corno na sola do meu sneaker

Who wanted me poor got sad this year
Wake up, Chris, time is ticking, ahn, ahn

Where does it go to the city, look, get out of the car
Their terror, their dream, every night my direct rains
I warned you that it was best not to get involved
I don't even know why anyone gets involved
I immortalize my face in each verse

Not even to forgive these guys I ask
Criticize me and your girl paying a ticket to see me

That there was an uncle of a guy from Muriqui

Two chests there put in the room, talk naughty
From stylefree Guadalajara cara selavi

Shaman in the glow, man, what do you mean?
She got naked in the dressing room
The girl ga-ga-gaga told me
Who loves me-ma-mava in sapatin'

Put it on daddy's account
Whatever I want, I have
Whatever you want, I have
You can let them know that the dance is ours (let them know)
It's just that where I come from, I'm really tough, I can
Any trouble unfolds with papa
I became top ranking, scene robber
Expensive head, most requested name on the track
Bavaria turned playboy
Have you ever seen playboy live on the hill?
bandit artist
Baby until you see
I am my own help, today I sing and pay in cash
Where I arrive, I stop everything
And she looks at me and doesn't even blink

Peita or respect, it's the godfather's troop
1Kilo Army, DJ Greek General
We put our foot in the door, we play terror in the scene
Ready to spoil your party in national territory
Samuel Rosa burning, we're carrying a rascal's soda
Our tram on stage is several MC's flying, literally speaking
We are in the mouth of the people, accept that it hurts less
While y'all just talk, we're doing
Want to jab, indirect with these rhymes more or less
Try your luck, you'll end up dying
The face of repression, let these shit cry
Why are we in the first place
Same as Flipper's Embedded Iori
Groupies trying to open my zipper
Do you really want to try against the tram?
They're going to end up with the horns on the sole of my sneaker

Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the tide
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee

(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy bein' yours
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you
You might also like
So have you got the guts?
Been wonderin' if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down an' pucker up, I'm sorry to interrupt
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you
But I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to

(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawlin' back to you (Crawlin' back to you)
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few? (Had a few)
'Cause I always do ('Cause I always do)
Maybe I'm too (Maybe I'm too busy)
Busy bein' yours (Bein' yours)
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you
(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay

(Love me, love me)
(Say that you love me)
(Fool me, fool me)
(Go on and fool me)

Dear, I fear we're facing a problem
You love me no longer, I know
And maybe there is nothing
That I can do to make you do
Mama tells me I shouldn't bother
That I ought to stick to another man
A man that surely deserves me
But I think you do

So I cry and I pray
And I beg for you to

Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Go on and fool me
Love me, love me
Pretend that you love me
Leave me, leave me
Just say that you need me
You might also like
Love me, love me
Fool me, fool me
Love me, love me
Fool me, fool me

Lately I have desperately pondered
Spent my nights awake
And I wondered what I could have done
In another way to make you stay
Reason will not lead to solution
I will end up lost in confusion
I don't care if you really care
As long as you don't go

So I cry and I pray
And I beg for you to

Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Go on and fool me
Love me, love me
Pretend that you love me
Leave me, leave me
Just say that you need me
Love me, love me
Fool me, fool me
Love me, love me
Fool me, fool me

Oh, I cry and I pray
And I beg for you to love me
I cry and I pray
And I beg for you to love me

Love me, love me
Fool me, fool me
Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Love me, love me
For you to love me
Fool me, fool me
For you to love me
Love me, love me
For you to love me
Love me, love me

Jason Derulo, ah
Savage love (685, baby)

If I woke up without ya, I don't know what I would do
Thought I could be single forever till I met you
Usually don't be fallin', be fallin', fallin' fast
You got a way of keepin' me comin' back-to-back
I just found out, the only reason that you lovin' me
Was to get back at your ex lover but before you leave
Usually I would never, would never even care
Baby, I know she creepin', I feel it in the air

Every night and every day (Every day)
I try to make you stay, but your

Savage love
Did somebody, did somebody break your heart?
Lookin' like an angel, but your savage love
When you kiss me, I know you don't give two fucks
But I still want that

Your savage love
Your savage lo-lo-love
Your savage lo-lo-love
You could use me 'cause I still want that (Your savage love)
You might also like
Baby, I hope that this ain't karma 'cause I get around
You wanna run it up, I wanna lock it down
Usually don't be fallin', be fallin', fallin' fast
You got a way of makin' me spend up all my cash

Every night and every day (Every day)
I try to make you stay, but your

Savage love, did somebody

Lookin' like an angel, but your savage love
When you kiss me, I know you don't give two fucks

180,180,180,Ariana Grande,Santa Tell Me,"50 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolPortuguêsFrançaisAriana Grande - Santa Tell Me (Polskie Tłumaczenie)*Santa Tell Me Lyrics
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
""Let It Snow"" is blasting out
But I won't get in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's

True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day, I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's
You might also like
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

Oh, I wanna have him beside me, like oh-woo-oh
On the 25th, by that fireplace, oh-woo-oh
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year I've got to be smart
Oh, baby
(Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me)
If he will be, if he will be here
(Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me)

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
""Let It Snow"" is blasting out
But I won't get in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's

True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day, I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's
You might also like
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

Oh, I wanna have him beside me, like oh-woo-oh
On the 25th, by that fireplace, oh-woo-oh
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year I've got to be smart
Oh, baby
(Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me)
If he will be, if he will be here
(Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me)
Oh, woah

Santa, tell me (Santa, tell me) if you're really there ('Cause I really care)

Need a boy who can cuddle with me all night

Tell me lies, we can argue, we can fight
Yeah, we did it before, but we'll do it tonight

With dark skin, lookin' at me like he know me

Hajnal 2 óra van
Csak hívogat engem folyton-folyton
Ezzel nem lenne baj
Ha nem tudnám, hogy palid van otthon-otthon
Hülyének nézel engem is
Folyton telefonozol este, reggel is
Addig játszanád a szereped míg élek
De most lépek ennyi, amit ígérek
Nézz rám kislány, nekem nem kellesz
Eleget húztuk az időt, most már engedj el!
Úgyis találsz pár órán belül egy verebet
Aki minden estе helyettem tеsz eleget

Felednéd a nevemet, béjbe
Keresnéd a szerelmet, tényleg
Csak éjszaka jönnél át
Mert a palid akkor nem lát
Nem lát, nem hív, nem keres
Vajon épp most ki mellett lehet?
Tagadod a nevem, hogyha kérdezik
Ez a nő engem kikészít
(Ez a nő engem kikészít)

Reggel 7 óra van
Míg más munkába tart, én meg éppen most érek haza
Valami egybe tart
Az utolsó mondat: „Remélem, hogy látlak hamar”
Mert én másnap azt hittem, hogy álmodtam
Mikor átokból csodára váltottam
Mikor elfogadtam, hogy én kárhoztam
Hiába szorít ez a lánc, de nem változtam

Uh-oh-oh-oh-ohoh-oh-ohoh-oh-oh
Szorít a láncom, de nem változtam
Uh-oh-oh-oh-ohoh-oh-ohoh-oh-oh

Mert a palid akkor nem lát
Nem lát, nem hív, nem keres
Vajon épp most ki mellett lehet?
Tagadod a nevem, hogyha kérdezik
Ez a nő engem kikészít

Feledném, de idehúz
Itt maradtam ezer újabb választ várva
Keresném, de hova bújt?
Többé nem foglalkozok más gondjával
Feledném, de idehúz
Itt maradtam ezer újabb választ várva
Keresném, de hova bújt?

It's 2 o'clock in the morning
He just keeps calling me
That would be fine
If I didn't know that your friend was at home
You make me look stupid too
You keep calling at night and in the morning
You would play your part as long as I live
But I'm going now, that's all I promise
Look at me girl, I don't need you
We've wasted enough time, now let me go!
You'll find a sparrow within a few hours anyway
Who does enough for me every night

You'd forget my name, damn it
You're looking for love, really
You would only come over at night
Because your pal can't see it then
He doesn't see, he doesn't call, he doesn't search
Who can he be next to right now?
You deny my name when asked

Something holds together

Because the next day I thought I had dreamed
When I changed from a curse to a miracle
When I accepted that I cursed
No matter how tight this chain is, I haven't changed

Uh-oh-oh-oh-ohoh-oh-ohoh-oh-oh
My chain is tight, but I haven't changed
Uh-oh-oh-oh-ohoh-oh-ohoh-oh-oh

Én fasza gyerek vagyok, azt mondják nekem a spanok, túl makacs vagyok, de ilyen ez a vér
Megyek az utamon, azt hogy mit hoz, nem tudhatom, szerintük ez veszélyes lehet, de én
Senkire nem hallgattam
Amit kaptam, én is mindig azt adtam
Fent maradok, dolgozok még hajnalban
Az Ördög folyton itt liheg a sarkamban

Én nem mondok soha sorry-t
Letépem a láncomat magamról, hogyha szorít
Rámegyek és zsákolok, játszom itt a Kobe-t
Én is csak 8 után érkezem meg, mint a Covid
Az emberek behálóznak sajátnak, tiszta wifi
Megszoktam, hogy másoknak az álmaim a sci-fi
Kimásztam már a sárból, onnan jöttem ide, szivi
Az akkordokat vakon fogom le úgy, mint a Stevie
Nekеm azt kamázzák a zenémben, hogy e-rеdeti
Előfordul, hogy valaki, pont nem szereti
Mennyi munkám van ebben, ezt sok elfeledi
Folyton célkeresztben vagyok, John F. Kennedy
Éjjel csinálom a pénzt a cimborákkal
Lassan házat veszek, végeztem a kisszobával
Nem kérjük a kommentjeidet a piszkos száddal
Kitörölheted a seggedet a diplomáddal

C4, megkoronázott hip-hop Maradona
Hiába kértek kisgyerekként, nem hallgattam a szépszóra
Rajtam a mezem, amíg fenn vannak a kezek
Én a Kempinski helyett inkább a telepen leszek
Árnyékos oldal, ahol megszokott a káosz
Rapzene a híd, tudod, minden boldogsághoz
Mert itt nincsen Crips, se Bloods, nem lettem bandatag
Túsznak leszel jó, ne hidd, hogy nagyba vagy
Faszagyerek voltam, vagyok és az maradok
Csak az első osztály, nem utazok a fapadon
Velem a csapatom és folyhat a Chivas
Magamnak zenéltem mindig, leszarom, ki csipáz
Stúdióba be, itt rap zene lesz életfogytig
Hígult a szakma, a műfaj romlik
Fain vagyok egy bizonyos pontig
Kamu-celeb-szajhák, mind forintos prostik
Én fasza gyerek vagyok, azt mondják nekem a spanok, túl makacs vagyok, de ilyen ez a vér
Megyek az utamon, azt hogy mit hoz, nem tudhatom, szerintük ez veszélyes lehet, de én
Senkire nem hallgattam

I'm a fucking child, the Spans tell me, I'm too stubborn, but that's the blood
I'm going on my way, I don't know what it will bring, they think it can be dangerous, but I do
I didn't listen to anyone
I always gave what I got
I stay up, I work until dawn
The Devil is always panting in my corner

I never say sorry
I tear my chain off me as if it were holding me tight
I'm going to go and sack, I'm playing Kobe here
I also arrive only after 8, like Covid
People network for themselves, clean wifi
I'm used to other people's dreams being science fiction
I've already climbed out of the mud, that's where I came here, dear
I play the chords blindly like Stevie
In my music, they tell me that it is e-created
It happens that someone just doesn't like it
Many people forget how much work I have in this
I'm always in the crosshairs, John F. Kennedy
I make money at night with my buddies
I'm slowly buying a house, I'm done with the small room
We don't ask for your comments with your dirty mouth
You can wipe your ass with your degree

C4, the crowned Maradona of hip-hop
Even though I was asked as a small child, I didn't listen to the nice word
I have my jersey on as long as my hands are up
I'd rather be at the camp than the Kempinski
Shadow side, where chaos is common
Rap music is the bridge, you know, to all happiness
Because there are no Crips or Bloods here, I didn't become a gang member
You'll be good as a hostage, don't think you're big
I was, am and always will be a brat
First class only, I don't travel on the wooden bench
My team is with me and Chivas can continue
I've always made music for myself, I don't care who's playing
Into the studio, here will be rap music for life
The profession is diluted, the genre is deteriorating
I'm fain up to a point
Kamu-celeb-whores, all forint pros
I'm a fucking child, the Spans tell me, I'm too stubborn, but that's the blood
I'm going on my way, I don't know what it will bring, they think it can be dangerous, but I do

I was scared of dentists and the dark
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh, all my friends are turning green
You're the magician's assistant in their dream

Oh, oh-o-oh, and they come unstuck

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you, when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong

There's this movie that I think you'll like
This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
This cowboy's running from himself
And she's been living on the highest shelf

But I need your lips on mine

Can you kiss me more?
We're so young, boy, we ain't got nothin' to lose, oh-oh

Then I might bе onto somethin'
I ain't givin' you one in public
I'm givin' you hundreds, fuck it
Somethin' we just gotta get into
Sign first, middle, last on the wisdom tooth
Niggas wishin' that the pussy was a kissin' booth
Taste breakfast, lunch, and gin and juice
And that dinner just like dessert too
And when we French, refresh, give me two
When I bite that lip, come get me too

I will come back one more time

All people return home
Warm winter heated by home
You just have to be good
That you will always be here

The fog rises, I watch in silence
Time is running out, but it's not too late
They are waiting, more than expected
I'm looking for the old spaces
The bartender waves, sits and waits!

The landscape is familiar
I hear your voices
The pine tree is greener now

I am coming back
I am coming back
I am coming back
I am coming back

I will come back one more time
The rain is blown away by the wind
All people return home
The winter heated by the home is warm
You just have to be good
That you will always be here
I will come back one more time
I'll be back one more time Embed",hu,"{'reach', 'time', 'parked', 'column', 'old', 'looking', 'heated', 'wave', 'snow', 'dance', 'familiar', 'snowed', 'machine', 'waiting', 'good', 'watch', 'heavily', 'space', 'warm', 'latest', 'sits', 'away', 'bartender', 'nice', 'freeze', 'return', 'region', 'public', 'bear', 'wind', 'car', 'continuously', 'strongly', 'working', 'information', 'fog', 'expected', 'according', 'ice', 'lyric', 'winter', 'landscape', 'late', 'blown', 'hear', 'year', 'voice', 'toy', 'wish', 'cooperation', 'rise', 'wait', 'tree', 'back', 'number', 'miklós', 'people', 'removal', 'greener', 'running', 'ask', 'silence', 'rain', 'home', 'started', 'within', 'morning', 'pine', 'contributorsvisszajövök'}"

Hey, hey, hey
Good to see you
Come on, dude, let's go
Yeah, let's go
Hahaha, alright
Alright, okay
Uh, alright, okay
Alright, okay

Return of the Mack
Get 'em; what it is? What it does? What it is? What it isn't?
Looking for a better way to get up outta bed
Instead of getting on the Internet
And checking on who hit me, get up
Thrift shop, pimp-strut walkin'
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Sweater game, nope, nope, y'all can't copy, yeah
Bad, moonwalking, this here is our party
My posse's been on Broadway, and we did it our way
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones
Into everything I record to it and yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit, hustlin'
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen
With the four-track, bussin'
Halfway 'cross that city with the back (Back) pack (Pack), fat (Fat) cat (Cat), crushin'
Labels out here, now they can't tell me nothin' (Hey, hey, hey)
We give that to the people, spread it across the country (Hey, hey, hey, oh)
Labels out here, now they can't tell me nothin' (Hey, hey, hey)
We give it to the people, spread it across the country (Hey, hey, hey, oh)

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Now, can I kick it? Thank you
Yeah, I'm so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But that's what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Y'all can't stop me
Go hard like I got a 808 in my heartbeat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on Shark Week, raw
Time to go off, I'm gone
Deuces, goodbye, I got a world to see
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer
Nah, I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Now, sing a song, and it goes like
Raise those hands, this is our party (Hey, hey, hey)
We came here to live life like nobody was watching (Hey, hey, hey, oh)
I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me (Hey, hey, hey)
Learn from that failure, gain humility (Hey, hey, hey)
And then we keep marching, I said
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over

I know you moved onto someone new
Hope life is beautiful
You were the light for me to find my truth
I just wanna say, thank you

Leaving to find my soul
Told her I had to go
And I know it ain't pretty
When our hearts get broke
Too young to feel this old
Watching us both turn cold
Oh, I know it ain't pretty
When two hearts get broke
Yeah, I know it ain't pretty
When two hearts get broke

I hope someday we'll sit down together
And laugh with each other about these days, these days
All our troubles, we'll lay to rest and
We'll wish we could come back to these days, these days

Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
These days, these days
Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know

Three years of ups and downs
Nothing to show for it now
And I know it ain't pretty when the fire burns out
Calling me when I'm drunk, remind me of what I've done
And I know it ain't pretty when you're trying to move on, yeah

I hope someday we'll sit down together
And laugh with each other about these days, these days
All our troubles, we'll lay to rest and
We'll wish we could come back to these days, these days

Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
These days, these days
Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
To these days, these days, oh

Cigarettes in the ashtray
Reminiscing on those past days
I thought you’d end up with my last name
But that changed
And I travelled around the world
Think where you living at now?
I heard you moved to Austin
Got an apartment and settled down
And every once in a while, I start texting
Write a paragraph, but then I delete the message
Think about you like a past time
I could cry you a river, get you baptized or
I wasn't ready to act right
Used to always think I'd get you back, right
They say that things fall apart
We were gonna move to Brooklyn
You were gonna study art
Love is just a tool
To remind us who we are
And that we are not alone
When we're walking in the dark
I hope someday we'll sit down together
And laugh with each other about these days, these days
All our troubles, we'll lay to rest and
We'll wish we could come back to these days, these days

Nem hasonlítunk másokra
Woah, woah, woah
Nincs szükség új barátokra
Woah, woah, woah
Vigyázzatok a szátokra
Woah, woah, woah, bébi
Woah, woah, woah, bébi

Velünk van az egész város
Ez kemény munka, nem voltam soha szélhámos
A brigádom egyszerre veszélyes és sármos
Olyan gyorsan jövünk fel, mint a Mészáros
Nem, nem, nem megyek vissza az egyetemre
Azon vagyok, a mikrofont soha ne tegyem le
Köszönöm, én jól érzem magam a szerepembe’
Elkölteni a pénzemet nem esik nehezemre
1 hónap, 10 millió, megesik
Mindig a kifogást kerеsik
Van egy szabadnapom, azután dolgozok, megint úton vagyok hetеkig
Folyton bizonyítok, de nekik
Nem elég, a hátam mögött kinevetik
Felőlem nevessetek, de attól még a zenéim topon, a listákat vezetik
Egyszer véget ér, de ma nem fog még
Kiélvezem ezt, mielőtt elkopnék
Szereztem barátokat, meg sok lét
A városban már mindenki megvolt rég

Menedzserem hívott
Hogy megint elsők vagyunk, mostanában ez így volt
Csak az maradt velem máig, aki bennem bízott
Ide nem lehet bekerülni, húzd el a csíkot
Soha nem spanokkal le olyannal, akit nem ismerek (Soha)
Ne kérd azt, hogy a buliba ingyen bevigyelek (Köszi)
Velünk akartok lógni, sajnos nem segíthetek
Ha nem tetszik eriggyetek, sosem voltam szelíd gyerek (Pa-pa-pa)
Sok ember jön oda hozzám, mutatja be nekem magát
Haver, én nem fogok kezet veled, tudom, mit akarsz, jól ismerem a fajtád
Simán megszámolom egy kezemen az embereket, kikre mondom, hogy barát
Visszaveszem azt, ami az enyém, a sírotokon járom majd a csa csa csát
Na csá-csá-csá-csá
Egyszer véget ér, de ma nem fog még
Kiélvezem ezt, mielőtt elkopnék
Szereztem barátokat, meg sok lét
A városban már mindenki megvolt rég

We are not like others

We have the whole city with us
It's hard work, I've never been a crook
My brigade is both dangerous and charming
We come up as fast as the Butcher
No, no, I'm not going back to college
I'm determined to never put the microphone down
Thank you, I feel good in my role'
I don't find it difficult to spend my money
1 month, 10 million, it happens
They are always looking for an excuse
I have a day off, then I work, and I'm on the road again for weeks
I keep proving myself, but to them
It's not enough, they make fun of me behind my back
Laugh at me, but my music is still at the top, leading the charts
It will end someday, but not today
I'm going to enjoy this before I wear it out
I made friends and a lot of life
Everyone in town has been there for a long time

My manager called me
That we are first again, it's been like that lately
Only the one who trusted me has remained with me to this day
You can't get in here, remove the strip
I never spank with someone I don't know (Never)
Don't ask me to take you to the party for free (Thanks)
You want to hang out with us, unfortunately I can't help
If you don't like it, piss me off, I was never a gentle child (Pa-pa-pa)
Many people come up to me and introduce themselves to me
Dude, I won't shake hands with you, I know what you want, I know your kind well
I easily count the people I call friends on one hand
I will take back what is mine, I will walk on your graves
Cssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
It will end someday, but not today
I'm going to enjoy this before I wear it out

Will you hold the line
When every one of them has given up and given in? Tell me
In this house of mine
Nothing ever comes without a consequence or cost, tell me
Will the stars align?
Will Heaven step in? Will it save us from our sin? Will it?
'Cause this house of mine stands strong

Just another product of today

Deep inside me, I'm fading to black, I'm fading
Took an oath by the blood of my hand, won't break it
I can taste it, the end is upon us, I swear
I'm gonna make it
I'm gonna make it
