'Di ba nga ito ang iyong gusto?
O, ito'y lilisan na ako
Mga alaala'y ibabaon
Kalakip ang tamis ng kahapon
Mga gabing 'di namamalayang oras ay lumilipad
Mga sandaling lumalayag kung sa'n man tayo mapadpad
Bawat kilig na nadarama sa tuwing hawak ang 'yong kamay
Ito'y maling akala, isang malaking sablay

Pasensya ka na
Sa mga kathang isip kong ito
Wari'y dala lang ng pagmamahal sa iyo
Ako'y gigising na
Sa panaginip kong ito
At sa wakas ay kusang lalayo sa iyo
(Lalayo sa)
Gaano kabilis nagsimula
Gano'n katulin nawala
Maaari ba tayong bumalik sa umpisa
Upang 'di na umasa ang pusong nag-iisa?

Pasensya ka na (Pasensya ka na)

Wari'y dala lang  ng pagmamahal sa iyo
Ako'y gigising na (Ako'y gigising na)
Sa panaginip kong ito

Sumabay sa agos na isinulat ng tadhana
Na minsan siya'y para sa iyo, pero minsan siya'y paasa
Tatakbo papalayo, kakalimutan ang lahat

Pero kahit saan man lumingon
Nasusulyapan ang kahapon

'Isn't this what you want?
Oh, it will leave me
Memories will be buried
The sweetness of yesterday is attached
Nights without realizing time flies
Moments that sail wherever we land
Every thrill I feel every time I hold your hand
This is a misconception, a big mistake

I'm sorry
In these fictions of mine
It seems to be brought only by love for you
I will wake up
In my dream
And finally will voluntarily walk away from you
(Go away from)
How quickly it started
That's how fast it disappeared
Can we go back to the beginning?
So that the lonely heart can no longer hope?

I'm sorry (I'm sorry)
In these fictions of mine
It seems to be brought only by love for you
I'm gonna wake up (I'm gonna wake up)

Go with the flow written by destiny
That sometimes he is for you, but sometimes he is a hope
Run away, forget everything

But no matter where you turn

I met you in the dark, you lit me up
You made me feel as though I was enough
We danced the night away, we drank too much
I held your hair back when you were throwin' up

Then, you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, ""I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest""
I knew I loved you then, but you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you, but I never showed
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school, wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, woah
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that every day, you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you and I hope you know
Darlin', your love is more than worth its weight in gold

If you are not the only reason

Chilled and unable to move

Allow yourself to fall in love again

If you are not the only reason
Will you choose to avoid getting hurt?
If not you, who else?
The tears in the morning for both of us?

Letting go, because I can't move
Does your heart stop being shouted at?

If we're not in the end
Allow yourself to fall in love again

Nagbabakasakaling lilingon ka pa
Hindi na ba mababalik ang mga sandali
Mga panahong may lalim pa ang iyong ngiti

Bakit ka nag-iba?
Meron na bang iba?

I'm on my way to Havana, do you want to go sailing with me anyway?
Come on, let's cruise the Panama Canal
And eat pineapple with cream, I splash Anna wet with cream
I banged that bitch in Paris on the Eiffel Tower
You're jealous because unfortunately you don't have any fans
You don't have little groupies writing you love letters
And ask you: ""Could you sign the bikini?""
And I said no gun talk to the bitch
""When you're with me, I'll buy you Prada stuff all the time""
And if I say I'll give you a latte now
I don't talk about brown drinks or fence elements
She sucked the dick in St Tropez
Sucked at Kentucky Fried Chicken in L.A
In the middle of the neighborhood
I fuck with bitches in Jamaica in a reed hut
Two black babes and me homie - milk cut


My house is as big as the Bayern Arena
And my suit is a Joop, like the coach from Bayern
And I don't give a fuck about tabloids
I only watch Taff because I love horny Miss Warnkross so much
And yes, I'll admit it, I had sex with Annemarie Warnkross
And the rolls in the morning, yes, they were crispy
Get it? She fucked with a rapper
And the next day she took me something from a baker
And DJ Antoine is playing on the radio
We are again in Cannes in this cinema on the beach
I buy velvet jackets and smell like Paco Rabanne
Order macchiatos in Cannes and eat a taco on the beach
And whoever hates me actually hates himself
Or beautiful things, like horny women or money
As well as dresses from Chanel, cashmere, silk or fur
I cock haters away and take a trip around the world

I can think of all the times
You told me not to touch the light
I never thought that you would be the one
I couldn't really justify
How you even thought it could be right
'Cause everything we cherished is gone
And in the end can you tell me if
It was worth the try, so I can decide

Leaves will soon grow from the bareness of trees
And all will be alright in time
From waves overgrown come the calmest of seas
And all will be alright in time
Oh you never really love someone until, you learn to forgive
Try as hard as I might
To flee the shadows of the night
It haunts me and it makes me feel blue
But how can I try to hide
When every breath and every hour
I still end up thinking of you
And in the end everything we have makes it worth the fight
So I will hold on for as long

As leaves will soon grow from the bareness of trees
And all will be alright in time
From waves overgrown come the calmest of seas
And all will be alright in time
Oh, you never really love someone until you learn to forgive

I never thought that I would see the day
That I'd decide if I should leave or stay
But in the end what makes it worth the fight's
That no matter what happens we try to make it right

Leaves will soon grow from the bareness of trees
And all will be alright in time
From waves overgrown come the calmest of seas

17,17,17,17,17,17,H.E.R.,Best Part,"Rap Up 2020 Lyrics
Definitely did take a long time
2020 been a sad year
Wasn't gon' even do this
But I figured y'all needed me after everything that been goin' on
The homie Great John on the beat, by the way
Don't Come Outside, Volume 3 out now
Great John on the beat, by the way

I'm a fan Heavenly Father but right now I'm booing you
What did Kobe, Gigi and them other passengers do to you? (What they do?)
My condolences at this time is all I could offer
Kobe got me out here spendin' more time with my daughter (He do)
Takin' Kobe from us had the whole world stressed
You coulda took a average player, not one of the best
Somebody like Lamar Odom or Delonte West (Ah)
I'm just playin', but I'm sayin', we woulda missed them less (God bless)
I'm convinced God don't got the answers
First you take the Black Mamba from us, then the Black Panther (Damn)
Fuck 2020, this whole year started off wack
Best part of the year's here and that's hearin' me rap (You want it)
Hearin' me rap that straight up, 2020's a dub, nigga
Atlanta the only spot that ain't shut down they clubs, nigga (Lord)
Pandemic got niggas eatin' like Action Bronson
They ain't scared of catchin' the corona like Magic Johnson (You did)
Is it real? Is it fake? I don't know, I know shit sad
People dyin' from it off some shit that they been had
They said Trump had it but I think he was fakin' it
They got a vaccine now but I still ain't takin' it (God)
We all saw that nurse who passed out from that shit
Live on TV, miss me with that funny shit
I don't trust the government, they chasin' that fuckin' bag
Whole coronavirus shit feel like a money grab
They tryna get paid, virus is man-made
They actin' like this shit worser than cancer and AIDS (Than cancer)
Kids can't go to school, people can't go to work
Strip clubs closed, bitches ain't got nowhere to twerk (Nah)
Now they lookin' for sponsors, so I'm tellin' chicks, ""I'm broke""
That was prop money on the 'Gram, Kodak Black joke (I ain't got it)
I'm not a big fan of this next line I wrote
I hate the fact I gotta say, ""Rest in peace to Pop Smoke"" (Damn)
The good die young, it really wasn't his time
Him bein' dead and Tekashi still livin' is a crime
God, you gotta do better, you been fuckin' up lately
Bro, all I hear is Pop Smoke when I turn on my radio (Woo)
They play Pop so much it feel like he still here
Got us woo walkin', wearin' Dior just to be clear (Facts)
COVID-19 shit got Fred The Godson
One of the few emcees you could really get bars from
He represented real rap for real New Yorkers
My condolences to your wife and your two daughters
Kings killin' kings and it's bein' filmed on camera
Hated seein' niggas killing King Von in Atlanta (Wack)
Megan sayin' Tory shot her, he sayin' she cappin'
Them people that was in the truck with them told me what happened (They told me)
He wanted that wet-ass pussy, she ain't give him none
She hurt Tory ego and that's when he pulled out a gun
Then she tried to leave and that's when he start clappin'
I made that whole shit up but that sound like what really happened (Haha)
If he really did shoot her, that was some lame shit
She snitchin' now but she a girl so it ain't the same shit (Yeah)
We ain't lookin' at her like how we look at 6ix9ine
Lookin' at Tory like he played himself, fuck was on his mind? (What up?)
That bullet ain't faze her, her leg ain't even hurtin'
A week after she got shot, Meg was back twerkin' (Body-ody-ody-ody)
Been a crazy year, wouldn't you say?
Found out Jada Pinkett gave Will Smith pussy away (She did what?)
Tried to call it an entanglement so it don't sound like nothin'
No, it's called cheatin', Jada, you and August was fuckin' (God)
Got Will Smith out here lookin' like a whole sucker
Wonder how Jaden and Willow feel about they mother (Damn)
Fuck that Red Table, let's discuss some other shit
I wonder if Will asked Jada, did she suck his dick? (Woah)
Now he questionin' how you and 'Pac was out here movin'
He was lookin' stressed at the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air reunion (He was)
Actin' like he give a fuck 'bout how Aunt Viv feel
He probably think that she difficult to work with still (Haha, sheesh)
Cardi B filed for divorce
You know how her and Offset do, they back together, of course (Stop playin')
Dr. Dre wife tried to get two mill' a month
I know Dre happy that she signed that prenup
Dre my nigga, his business all in the street (All in the street)
How much of that man money she tryna keep?
She wasn't with him in the studio makin' them beats
Bitch, you wasn't with me in the studio makin' them beats (Woo)
Put your pussy lips on live, I'll give ya a thousand dollars
Boosie was bein' too thirsty, I'm just bein' honest (He was)
If doin' too much was a person
They deleted his account, now his shit ain't workin' (Damn)
Instagram missin' you, the Internet fuck with you
In that interview with Mike Tyson, you looked uncomfortable
For talkin' 'bout Dwyane Wade's son, he was pressin' you
He was askin' you if you was gay, he was disrespectin' you
Never seen Boosie Badazz talkin' so polite (Never)
He ain't want no smoke with that nigga Iron Mike (Uh-uh)
Woulda looked like Nate Robinson if Mike Tyson hit him
Rest in peace to the homie Mo3 who there with him (Damn)
Couple days after Mo3 died, Boosie got shot
Them Dallas niggas thought Boosie was tryna spin the block (Skrrt)
That nigga Akon was out here trippin'
Tryna explain and justify 6ix9ine snitchin'
I'm locked up, they won't let me out, we felt that
He tried to remix that old-ass record with a rat (You played yourself)
All these rappers gettin' shot, not one bullet hit Tekashi
They really let that nigga out early and kept Bobby (Free Rowdy)
Y'all couldn't wait for this shit to drop
I really entertain y'all with all this shit I pop (I do, right?)
Every year 'round the same time, y'all check for me (Ah)
They like how I disrespect niggas respectfully (True)
Y'all heard what happened, y'all know what happened
But y'all don't care (Y'all don't care)
Y'all still want me to talk about this shit every year (Every year)
Crazy, crazy, shit crazy (I just don't wanna stop, crazy)
Crazy, crazy, shit crazy

Jeezy shouldn't have battled Gucci
Knowin' he was gon' rap about killin' his homie Pookie (Woo)
I get it but fuck all that culture shit
Disrespect my dead homie, I'm poppin' off, battle over with
Try to shoot the nigga up, cut the nigga, at least fuckin' fight
Niggas talk about smokin' on Pookie Loc tonight (Facts)
One of the most disrespectful things that I ever seen
Gucci ignorant but remind me of me when I was seventeen (He do)
Niggas on the streets sayin', ""Jeezy lost it""
That was some sucker shit, he movin' too corporate (Damn)
I ain't with that cool shit, I'm with that ra-ra
JAY-Z wouldn't battle Nas if Nas killed Ty Ty (He wouldn't)
Pookie rollin' over in his grave, you got him hurt
Watchin' you perform with the nigga that put him in the dirt
He prolly got some other issues, leave Jeezy alone
Big Meech brother Southwest T just came home
Let's talk about some shit that got the people upset
Cops that killed Breonna Taylor ain't get arrested yet
Attorney General Daniel Cameron fucked us all up
Them cops that killed Breonna got charged with shootin' the wall up
I repeat, Daniel Cameron is a sell-out
He in a sunken place, like that movie, can't Get Out
Defund the police, Obama said he don't believe in that
In the country where you can't even jog while bein' black (I'm disappointed)
Rest in peace to Ahmaud Arbery
An ex-cop killed him thinkin' he committed a robbery
George Floyd gettin' murdered was on the Internet
For eight minutes straight that cop had his knee on his neck
The whole world came together and protested
They ain't convict him yet but at least they did get arrested (Woo)
Unity was real, government start gettin' scared
We was marchin' like the coronavirus disappeared
White people was out here screamin', ""Black Lives Matter""
And honestly I think that was makin' the police madder (They scared)
And all Donald Trump did was talk about Louis
Nothin' 'bout the knee on the neck and police shootings
He encouraged the police violence
Trump dumbass told us, ""Take Lysol for the virus""
Said it was goin' away, of course he lyin'
Over three hundred thousand Americans done died
Lil Wayne and Lil Pump jumped on Trump dick
Now look, now they look stupid for doin' that dumb shit (They do)
And he lost the election, I know he embarrassed
He know he ain't lose to Joe, he lost to Kamala Harris
Joe Biden knew what he was doin' when he picked her
He knew we was comin' out to vote for a Black sister (We did)
Trump had to go but Joe Biden need to get smacked
For tellin' us if we don't vote for him, we ain't Black
I still think you racist and that's my problem with you
We only voted for you 'cause you got Kamala with you
And I'm not a fan of both of y'all reputations
You and Kamala responsible for mass incarcerations
Y'all the reason they won't leave us alone
The best news we got all year was Rowdy comin' home
It was dope seein' him on Instagram bein' celebrated
He a real one, he ain't fold when he got interrogated
Pharrell was on Drink Champs talkin' some stupid shit
Just 'cause you pay taxes don't make it cool to snitch
I hear about certain shit that make my ass smile
R. Kelly got beat up in jail, good for that pedophile
I'ma miss Donald Trump, can't front, he was funny
Obama gave us trap phones, Trump gave us re-up money
He was makin' y'all laugh too, I'm just remindin' you
He was out here callin' the coronavirus the China flu (It comes from China)
I appreciated that he ain't bite his tongue
If that second stimulus check had came, he mighta won (He mighta)
That unemployment money had y'all feelin' like Big Meech
You was ballin' with that extra six hundred dollars a week (Y'all was)
Bitch, that was better than your regular job
Certain chicks couldn't pay bills unless head was involved
Your OnlyFans page really wasn't poppin' for real
Now you know how a local mixtape rap nigga feel
Them SBA loans had niggas out here in all kinda shit
They was just bums, now they pullin' up with designer shit (Oh, you serious?)
I'ma miss fake beefin' with Casanova
I was about to get on him for fuckin' with Fashion Nova
He prolly like, ""This nigga Murda always gotta play""
I wish he woulda turned himself in after the holidays
Hope I made him laugh while he fightin' for his freedom
Know it's free my nigga Casanova 'til they free him (Oh yeah)
(Is it okay if I call her one?) Who said that shit?
That was Snoop callin' Gayle King a funky dog head bitch
For goin' at Kobe with no consideration
On how his family was feelin' knowin' the situation
LeBron got his fourth ring, you gotta respect his shit
He was tired of hearin' y'all talkin' all that Kawhi Leonard shit
He gon' repeat this year, the Lakers look like a bigger threat
L.A. needed that, they ain't even get over Nipsey yet
That corona had niggas ballin' in a bubble
For James Harden, Houston already got rid of Russell
Y'all be disrespectin' Westbrook, that shit gotta stop
I ain't gon' lie, though, that nigga really don't got no jumpshot (Haha)
Lou Williams left the bubble to go to Magic City for chicken wings
He ain't go there for no ass and titties
Kawhi Leonard and Paul George blew a three-one lead
And Giannis ain't deserve to be the MVP of the league
He get in the playoffs and he look like JaVale McGee
I know that's disrespectful but I mean that respectfully
Brooklyn is litty with KD and Kyrie
Madison Square Garden disrespectin' Spike Lee ('Cause no one told me)
Deontay Wilder lost his first fight
He got beat up by Tyson, I ain't talkin' 'bout Mike
Oh, the Tyson that he got beat up by was white (Was white)
(To this day) Can't believe he got beat up that night
Adrien Broner was on the ""Catch Me Outside"" girl page
In her DM, oh, he ain't know she was underage (What?)
Floyd Mayweather struggled saying ""epidemic""
Everyday Struggle got canceled, they fired Akademiks
We saw Wack 100 knockin' out a racist cracker
They tried to jump him like they ain't know Black Lives Matter (Haha)
Supposedly Kanye worth around three bill'
But that ain't stoppin' him from tweetin' about how he feel
He been tryna leave Kim since he met up with Meek Mill
He think Drake fucked her too and him and JAY don't speak still
Y'all couldn't wait for this time to come
Y'all already know that that nigga Murda don't bite his tongue (I don't)
You forgot about Nick Gordon, no, I didn't
So what? He dead, we ain't care about him when he was livin'
Always blamed him for Bobbi Kristina dyin'
So to act like I care that he dead, I'd be lyin'
My newborn was born on Valentine's Day
That's the best gift a nigga coulda got, what more could I say?
Nicki had a baby, congratulations
Her husband and Meek almost got in an altercation
They shoulda just got it on, like, nobody get the blicky
It woulda been funny watchin' them fightin' over Nicki
Cardi B and Megan had conservatives tryna ban 'em
For that wet-ass pussy record, then it became an anthem

Y'all heard what happened, y'all know what happened
But y'all don't care (Yeah)

Crazy, crazy, shit crazy (Shit crazy)
Crazy, crazy, shit crazy (Woah, woah, woah, woah, shit crazy)
It's Great John beats, baby
Great John on the beat, by the way

I don't care if it still stink, I'ma leave her alone
Even though she out here wishin' R. Kelly was home (Damn)
Nick Cannon got fired for talkin' 'bout white people, he was Wild N Out
He forgot he work for white people
Scottie Pippen ex-wife still doin' ho shit
Jeremih almost died fuckin' around with that COVID
Ashanti got it too, they put the battle on hold
With O.T. Genasis arch-nemesis Keyshia Cole
Ashanti gon' win that battle, my girl love her
Irv Gotti was corny for tellin' Wendy he fucked her (He was)
Michael B. Jordan fuckin' Lori Harvey
I was on MSNBC with Ari (Woah)
Talkin' 'bout Trump gettin' impeached
We was politickin', look how far the Rap Up done reached
The first debate with Trump and Joe Biden was comedy
That's when I realized we gon' be fucked either way, honestly
Oprah and Gayle King still don't realize why we upset
We realize they ain't talk about Harvey Weinstein yet
Fuck whoever not with us, nigga, that's how I play
Rest in peace to that nigga Deebo from Friday
I hate 2020, this whole year had a nigga tight
Can't believe I'm sayin' rest in peace to my nigga Light
Dave East, where you at, homie? I hope you listenin'
Told my nigga Light to tell Shooter you fuckin' missin' him
Condolences to your fam' and your niggas in Queensbridge
We was gon' shoot a video for the record we did
Can't believe I'm tellin' my nigga Hank, ""Rest in peace""
Believe me when I tell you that this year was stressin' me (It was)
This year I really wasn't even gon' do this shit
Wasn't in the mood to laugh and joke about no stupid shit (Wasn't)
Then niggas just kept doin' stupid shit
Then I saw that Snoop Dogg post, like, I gotta do this shit (Okay)
Flex lost weight but he ain't do it the hard way
That nigga cheated, he went and got lipo' like Kanye
So many rappers got shot, I could be here forever
Joey Dollas got hit up, I hope he get better (Damn)
The Verzuz battles durin' quarantine was savin' us
Real talk, I wrote this shit while I was Jada drunk (I did)
Salute to Timbaland and Swizz Beatz
But a few battles y'all put together put us to sleep
Lil Baby got money so it's cool if he like to trick
It wasn't sixteen bands, though, bitch, it was only six
For kids in Philly, Meek do plenty of shit
How you gon' give them kids from Atlanta a $20 to split?
How nobody ain't whip Akademik ass yet?
On Clubhouse, Meek told him he got his address (Ha)
Zimmermann still livin', we should all be ashamed
50 got a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame
JAY-Z distributin' marijuana
This nigga A$AP Rocky fuckin' on Rihanna (Woah)
Everybody masked up, shit is the new normal
The feds is on Clubhouse, don't say I didn't warn you
Y'all wanted twenty minutes, I was gon' really try it
But I was in that motherfuckin' booth gettin' tired
Like LeBron said, I want my damn respect
R.I.P. to the homie Alex Trebek
Shit crazy, nigga, this year was hard as hell
Icons died, rest in peace to Andre Harrell
Without him it wouldn't have been no Diddy (Wouldn't have)
So that mean it probably wouldn't have been no Biggie (Facts)
You see how important he was? So that shit hit me
I almost forgot to mention, you my nigga, forgive me
Fuck 2020, I'm done, it's a wrap here
I ain't doin' this shit no more, this is my last year2Embed","Rap Up 2020 Lyrics
Definitely did take a long time

He probably think that she difficult to work with still (Haha, sheesh)
Cardi B filed for divorce
You know how her and Offset do, they back together, of course (Stop playin')
Dr. Dre wife tried to get two mill' a month
I know Dre happy that she signed that prenup
Dre my nigga, his business all in the street (All in the street)
How much of that man money she tryna keep?
She wasn't with him in the studio makin' them beats
Bitch, you wasn't with me in the studio makin' them beats (Woo)
Put your pussy lips on live, I'll give ya a thousand dollars
Boosie was bein' too thirsty, I'm just bein' honest (He was)
If doin' too much was a person
They deleted his account, now his shit ain't workin' (Damn)
Instagram missin' you, the Internet fuck with you
In that interview with Mike Tyson, you looked uncomfortable
For talkin' 'bout Dwyane Wade's son, he was pressin' you
He was askin' you if you was gay, he was disrespectin' you
Never seen Boosie Badazz talkin' so polite (Never)
He ain't want no smoke with that nigga Iron Mike (Uh-uh)
Woulda looked like Nate Robinson if Mike Tyson hit him
Rest in peace to the homie Mo3 who there with him (Damn)
Couple days after Mo3 died, Boosie got shot
Them Dallas niggas thought Boosie was tryna spin the block (Skrrt)
That nigga Akon was out here trippin'
Tryna explain and justify 6ix9ine snitchin'
I'm locked up, they won't let me out, we felt that
He tried to remix that old-ass record with a rat (You played yourself)
All these rappers gettin' shot, not one bullet hit Tekashi
They really let that nigga out early and kept Bobby (Free Rowdy)
Y'all couldn't wait for this shit to drop
I really entertain y'all with all this shit I pop (I do, right?)
Every year 'round the same time, y'all check for me (Ah)
They like how I disrespect niggas respectfully (True)
Y'all heard what happened, y'all know what happened
But y'all don't care (Y'all don't care)
Y'all still want me to talk about this shit every year (Every year)
Crazy, crazy, shit crazy (I just don't wanna stop, crazy)
Crazy, crazy, shit crazy

Jeezy shouldn't have battled Gucci
Knowin' he was gon' rap about killin' his homie Pookie (Woo)
I get it but fuck all that culture shit
Disrespect my dead homie, I'm poppin' off, battle over with
Try to shoot the nigga up, cut the nigga, at least fuckin' fight
Niggas talk about smokin' on Pookie Loc tonight (Facts)
One of the most disrespectful things that I ever seen
Gucci ignorant but remind me of me when I was seventeen (He do)
Niggas on the streets sayin', ""Jeezy lost it""
That was some sucker shit, he movin' too corporate (Damn)
I ain't with that cool shit, I'm with that ra-ra
JAY-Z wouldn't battle Nas if Nas killed Ty Ty (He wouldn't)
Pookie rollin' over in his grave, you got him hurt
Watchin' you perform with the nigga that put him in the dirt
He prolly got some other issues, leave Jeezy alone
Big Meech brother Southwest T just came home
Let's talk about some shit that got the people upset
Cops that killed Breonna Taylor ain't get arrested yet
Attorney General Daniel Cameron fucked us all up
Them cops that killed Breonna got charged with shootin' the wall up
I repeat, Daniel Cameron is a sell-out
He in a sunken place, like that movie, can't Get Out
Defund the police, Obama said he don't believe in that
In the country where you can't even jog while bein' black (I'm disappointed)
Rest in peace to Ahmaud Arbery
An ex-cop killed him thinkin' he committed a robbery
George Floyd gettin' murdered was on the Internet
For eight minutes straight that cop had his knee on his neck
The whole world came together and protested
They ain't convict him yet but at least they did get arrested (Woo)
Unity was real, government start gettin' scared
We was marchin' like the coronavirus disappeared
White people was out here screamin', ""Black Lives Matter""
And honestly I think that was makin' the police madder (They scared)
And all Donald Trump did was talk about Louis
Nothin' 'bout the knee on the neck and police shootings
He encouraged the police violence
Trump dumbass told us, ""Take Lysol for the virus""
Said it was goin' away, of course he lyin'
Over three hundred thousand Americans done died
Lil Wayne and Lil Pump jumped on Trump dick
Now look, now they look stupid for doin' that dumb shit (They do)
And he lost the election, I know he embarrassed
He know he ain't lose to Joe, he lost to Kamala Harris
Joe Biden knew what he was doin' when he picked her
He knew we was comin' out to vote for a Black sister (We did)
Trump had to go but Joe Biden need to get smacked
For tellin' us if we don't vote for him, we ain't Black
I still think you racist and that's my problem with you
We only voted for you 'cause you got Kamala with you
And I'm not a fan of both of y'all reputations
You and Kamala responsible for mass incarcerations
Y'all the reason they won't leave us alone
The best news we got all year was Rowdy comin' home
It was dope seein' him on Instagram bein' celebrated
He a real one, he ain't fold when he got interrogated
Pharrell was on Drink Champs talkin' some stupid shit
Just 'cause you pay taxes don't make it cool to snitch
I hear about certain shit that make my ass smile
R. Kelly got beat up in jail, good for that pedophile
I'ma miss Donald Trump, can't front, he was funny
Obama gave us trap phones, Trump gave us re-up money
He was makin' y'all laugh too, I'm just remindin' you
He was out here callin' the coronavirus the China flu (It comes from China)
I appreciated that he ain't bite his tongue
If that second stimulus check had came, he mighta won (He mighta)
That unemployment money had y'all feelin' like Big Meech
You was ballin' with that extra six hundred dollars a week (Y'all was)
Bitch, that was better than your regular job
Certain chicks couldn't pay bills unless head was involved
Your OnlyFans page really wasn't poppin' for real
Now you know how a local mixtape rap nigga feel
Them SBA loans had niggas out here in all kinda shit
They was just bums, now they pullin' up with designer shit (Oh, you serious?)
I'ma miss fake beefin' with Casanova
I was about to get on him for fuckin' with Fashion Nova
He prolly like, ""This nigga Murda always gotta play""
I wish he woulda turned himself in after the holidays
Hope I made him laugh while he fightin' for his freedom
Know it's free my nigga Casanova 'til they free him (Oh yeah)
(Is it okay if I call her one?) Who said that shit?
That was Snoop callin' Gayle King a funky dog head bitch
For goin' at Kobe with no consideration
On how his family was feelin' knowin' the situation
LeBron got his fourth ring, you gotta respect his shit
He was tired of hearin' y'all talkin' all that Kawhi Leonard shit
He gon' repeat this year, the Lakers look like a bigger threat
L.A. needed that, they ain't even get over Nipsey yet
That corona had niggas ballin' in a bubble
For James Harden, Houston already got rid of Russell
Y'all be disrespectin' Westbrook, that shit gotta stop
I ain't gon' lie, though, that nigga really don't got no jumpshot (Haha)
Lou Williams left the bubble to go to Magic City for chicken wings
He ain't go there for no ass and titties
Kawhi Leonard and Paul George blew a three-one lead
And Giannis ain't deserve to be the MVP of the league
He get in the playoffs and he look like JaVale McGee
I know that's disrespectful but I mean that respectfully
Brooklyn is litty with KD and Kyrie
Madison Square Garden disrespectin' Spike Lee ('Cause no one told me)
Deontay Wilder lost his first fight
He got beat up by Tyson, I ain't talkin' 'bout Mike
Oh, the Tyson that he got beat up by was white (Was white)

Adrien Broner was on the ""Catch Me Outside"" girl page
In her DM, oh, he ain't know she was underage (What?)
Floyd Mayweather struggled saying ""epidemic""
Everyday Struggle got canceled, they fired Akademiks
We saw Wack 100 knockin' out a racist cracker
They tried to jump him like they ain't know Black Lives Matter (Haha)
Supposedly Kanye worth around three bill'
But that ain't stoppin' him from tweetin' about how he feel
He been tryna leave Kim since he met up with Meek Mill
He think Drake fucked her too and him and JAY don't speak still
Y'all couldn't wait for this time to come
Y'all already know that that nigga Murda don't bite his tongue (I don't)
You forgot about Nick Gordon, no, I didn't
So what? He dead, we ain't care about him when he was livin'
Always blamed him for Bobbi Kristina dyin'
So to act like I care that he dead, I'd be lyin'
My newborn was born on Valentine's Day
That's the best gift a nigga coulda got, what more could I say?
Nicki had a baby, congratulations
Her husband and Meek almost got in an altercation
They shoulda just got it on, like, nobody get the blicky
It woulda been funny watchin' them fightin' over Nicki
Cardi B and Megan had conservatives tryna ban 'em
For that wet-ass pussy record, then it became an anthem

Michael B. Jordan fuckin' Lori Harvey
I was on MSNBC with Ari (Woah)
Talkin' 'bout Trump gettin' impeached
We was politickin', look how far the Rap Up done reached
The first debate with Trump and Joe Biden was comedy
That's when I realized we gon' be fucked either way, honestly
Oprah and Gayle King still don't realize why we upset
We realize they ain't talk about Harvey Weinstein yet
Fuck whoever not with us, nigga, that's how I play
Rest in peace to that nigga Deebo from Friday
I hate 2020, this whole year had a nigga tight
Can't believe I'm sayin' rest in peace to my nigga Light
Dave East, where you at, homie? I hope you listenin'
Told my nigga Light to tell Shooter you fuckin' missin' him
Condolences to your fam' and your niggas in Queensbridge
We was gon' shoot a video for the record we did
Can't believe I'm tellin' my nigga Hank, ""Rest in peace""
Believe me when I tell you that this year was stressin' me (It was)
This year I really wasn't even gon' do this shit
Wasn't in the mood to laugh and joke about no stupid shit (Wasn't)
Then niggas just kept doin' stupid shit

Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much
And that's an issue, but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends
It was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no calls
Now you're lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop
So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover

Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner

I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that blink-182 song

Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen, still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me, well, that's okay, baby
Only words bleed inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
You might also like
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Oh, you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were 16
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me, well, that's okay, baby
Only words bleed inside these pages
You just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on 6th Street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
""Wait for me to come home""275Embed","TranslationsPortuguêsΕλληνικάPhotograph Lyrics
Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen, still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me, well, that's okay, baby
Only words bleed inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home

Fallin' out, fallin' in
Nothing's sure in this world, no, no
Breakin' out, breakin' in
Never knowin' what lies ahead
We can really never tell it all, no, no, no
Say goodbye, say hello
To a lover or friend
Sometimes we never could understand
Why some things begin then just end
We can really never have it all, no, no, no
But oh, can't you see?
That no matter what happens
Life goes on and on
And so baby, just smile
'Cause I'm always around you
And I'll make you see how beautiful
Life is for you and me

Take a little time, baby
See the butterflies' colors
Listen to the birds that were sent
To sing for me and you
Can you feel me?
This is such a wonderful place to be
Even if there is pain now
Everything would be alright
For as long as the world still turns
There will be night and day
Can you hear me?
There's a rainbow always after the rain
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

Hittin' high, hittin' low
Win or lose you should go, yeah-yeah
Getting warm, getting cold
Weather could be so good or bad
But baby, this is life
Now don't get mad, no, no, no

There's a rainbow always after the rain

Life's full of challenges
Not all the time, we get what we want
But don't despair, my dear ('Cause I know now)
You'll take each trial
And you'll make it through the storm
'Cause you're strong
My faith in you is clear
So I'll say once again this world's wonderful and
Let us celebrate life, that's so beautiful, so beautiful, oh
Take a little time, baby

Kinukulayan ang isipan, pabalik sa nakaraan
'Wag mo nang balikan, patuloy ka lang masasaktan
Hindi nagkulang kakaisip sa isang magandang larawan
Paulit-ulit na binabanggit ang pangalang nakasanayan

Tayo ay pinagtagpo, ngunit hindi tinadhana
Sadyang mapaglaro itong mundo

Kinalimutan kahit nahihirapan
Para sa sariling kapakanan
Kinalimutan kahit nahihirapan
Mga oras na hindi na mababalikan
Pinagtagpo, ngunit hindi tinadhana
Puso natin ay hindi sa isa't isa

Hindi na maibabalik ang dati nating pagsasama
Ang tamis ng iyong halik ay 'di na madarama
Pangako sa isa't isa ay 'di na mabubuhay pa
Paalam sa'ting pag-ibig na minsa'y pinag-isa

Tayo ay pinagtagpo, ngunit hindi tinadhana
Sadyang mapaglaro itong mundo

Kinalimutan kahit nahihirapan
Para sa sariling kapakanan
Kinalimutan kahit nahihirapan
Mga oras na hindi na mababalikan

Colors the mind, back to the past
Don't go back, you'll just keep getting hurt
There was no lack of thought in a good picture
Saying the familiar name over and over again

We are meet, but not destined
It's just a playful world

Forgotten even with difficulty
For one's own sake
Forgotten even with difficulty
Times that will never come back
Met, but not fated
Our hearts are not for each other

Our previous marriage cannot be restored
The sweetness of your kiss will no longer be felt
Promise each other not to live anymore
Farewell to the love that once united us

We are brought together, but not destined
It's just a playful world

Forgotten even with difficulty
For one's own sake
Forgotten even with difficulty
Times that will never come back

Oh, giliw naririnig mo ba ang 'yong sarili?
Nakakabaliw lumalabas sa 'yong bibig
Alam kong uto-uto ako
Alam ko na marupok
Tao lang din naman kasi ako

May nararamdaman din ako
'Di kasi manhid na tulad mo
Alam kong sanay bumitaw ang isang tulad mo
Lalayo na ba ako?
Pa'no naman ako?
Nahulog na sa'yo
Binitawan mo lang ba talaga ako?
Pa'no naman ako?
Naghintay ng matagal sa'yo
Wala lang ba talaga lahat ng 'yon sa'yo?
Ano na bang gagawin ko? (Hmm-hmm)
(Na-na-na-na-na-na, na)

Sinasadya mo ba ang lahat
O trip mo lang ba ako saktan?
Pagtapos kong ibigay balikat ko 'pag ika'y umiiyak
Ano bang tingin mo sa akin?
Isa ba akong alipin?
Wala ka bang modo?
Anong ginawa mo?
Nagtiwala naman sa'yo

May nararamdaman din ako
'Di kasi manhid na tulad mo
Alam kong sanay bumitaw ang isang tulad mo
Lalayo na ba ako?
You might also like
Pa'no naman ako?
Nahulog na sa'yo
Binitawan mo lang ba talaga ako?
Pa'no naman ako?

Oh dear can you hear yourself?
It's crazy coming out of your mouth
I know I'm silly
I know it's fragile
I'm just a human too

I feel something too
'Cause it's not numb like you
I know someone like you is used to letting go
Am I going away?
What about me?
It's fallen on you
Did you really just let me go?
What about me?
Waited a long time for you
Don't you really have all that?
What should I do? (hmm-hmm)
(Na-na-na-na-na, na)

Are you doing everything on purpose?
Or are you just trying to hurt me?
After I give you my shoulder when you cry
What do you think of me?
Am I a slave?
Don't you have a mood?
What are you doing?
I trusted you

You need to know
When you are needed
It's like never before
You are the one to fight
Why do you always put yourself aside for others?
Longing for the person who won't come back, try to rest

And slowly lay down your body when you're probably not alone
Come on, there's no need to force it
Because you are important to me
It has a heart
But you don't see it
Even if we are in the corner
'You still don't ask for advice
A little more effort is needed
Oh, I'm just not the one who wants it
A little peek at what I feel for you

And slowly lay down your body when you're probably not alone
Come on, there's no need to force it
Because you are important to me

I found a love for me
Oh, darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

I could say I never dare
To think about you in that way
But, I would be lying
And I pretend I'm happy for you
When you find some dude to take home
But I won't deny that
In the midst of the crowds
In the shapes, in the clouds
I don't see nobody but you
In my rose-tinted dreams
Wrinkled silk on my sheets
I don't see nobody but you

Boy, you got me hooked onto something
Who could say that they saw us coming?
Tell me, do you feel the love?
Spend a summer or a lifetime with me
Let me take you to the place of your dreams
Tell me, do you feel the love?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

And I could say I never unzipped
Those blue Levi's inside my head
But that's far from the truth
Don't know what's come over me
It seems like yesterday when I said
“We'll be friends forever”

You're a nineteenth floor view

Paano dahan-dahang
Sinuyo ang puso?
Kay tagal ko nang nag-iisa
Andiyan ka lang pala
Mahiwaga
Pipiliin ka sa araw-araw
Mahiwaga
Ang nadarama sa'yo'y malinaw

Higit pa sa ligaya
Hatid sa damdamin
Lahat naunawaan
Sa lalim ng tingin

Sa minsang pagbali ng hangin
Hinila patungo sa akin
Tanging ika'y iibiging wagas at buo

It's morning in our cradle
Don't get lost
It's morning in our cradle
Love, or mysterious

Good acquaintances
At the first meeting
How slowly
Have a heart?
Because I've been alone for a long time
You're just there
Mysterious
You will be chosen every day
Mysterious
What you feel is clear

More than happiness
Sent to feelings
All understood
In the depth of the look

Mysterious
You will be chosen every day
Mysterious
What you feel is clear

Once the wind breaks
Pulled towards me
Only you will be loved purely and completely
Peace in the embrace of your mystery
Peace in the embrace of yours

Mysterious
You will be chosen every day

At ang galing-galing mong sumayaw
Mapa-boogie man o cha-cha
Ngunit ang paborito
Ay pagsayaw mo nang El Bimbo
Nakakaindak, nakakaaliw
Nakakatindig balahibo

Pagka-galing sa eskwela ay dideretso na sa inyo
At buong maghapon ay tinuturuan mo ako
Magkahawak ang ating kamay
At walang kamalay-malay
Na tinuruan mo ang puso ko
Na umibig ng tunay

Naninigas ang aking katawan
'Pag umikot na ang plaka
Patay sa kembot ng beywang mo
At pungay ng 'yong mga mata
Lumiliwanag ang buhay
Habang tayo'y magkaakbay
At dahan-dahang dumudulas ang kamay ko
Sa makinis mong braso, ooh

Sana noon pa man ay sinabi na sa iyo
Kahit hindi na uso ay ito lang ang alam ko

Magkahawak ang ating kamay
At walang kamalay-malay

You look like Paraluman
When we were young
And you dance so well
Be it boogie or cha-cha
But the favorite
You dance like El Bimbo
Awesome, entertaining
It's hair-raising

After coming home from school, I will go straight to you
And all day long you teach me
Let's hold hands
And unconsciously
That you taught my heart
To love truly

My body was stiff
'When the plaque has turned
Dead from the kembot of your waist
And your eyes sparkle
Life brightens
While we are arm in arm
And my hand slowly slipped
On your smooth arm, ooh

I wish you had been told before
Even if it's not trendy, it's all I know

Let's hold hands
And unconsciously
That you taught my heart
To love truly

In a dark alley

I can only dance with you in my dreams

If you told me that the world's endin'
Ain't no other way that I can spend it

'Di, 'di ko inakalang
Darating din sa akin
Nung ako'y nanalangin kay Bathala
Naubusan ng bakit

Bakit umalis ng walang sabi?
Bakit 'di siya lumaban kahit konti?
Bakit 'di maitama ang tadhana?
At nakita kita sa tagpuan ni Bathala
May kinang sa mata na 'di maintindihan
Tumingin kung saan sinubukan kong lumisan
At tumigil ang mundo, nung ako'y ituro mo
Siya ang panalangin ko

At hindi, 'di mapaliwanag
Ang nangyari sa akin
Saksi ang lahat ng tala
Sa iyong panalangin

Pa'no nasagot lahat ng bakit?
'Di makapaniwala sa nangyari
Pa'no mo naitama ang tadhana?

Nung nakita kita sa tagpuan ni Bathala
May kinang sa mata na 'di maintindihan

When I prayed to God
Run out of why

Why leave without saying a word?
Why didn't he fight at least a little?
Why can't destiny be corrected?
And I saw you at Bathala's meeting place
There's a glint in his eyes that he doesn't understand
Look where I tried to escape
And the world stopped, when you taught me
He is my prayer

And no, it's inexplicable
What happened to me
All records are witnesses
In your prayer

Why did you answer everything?
'Can't believe what happened
How did you correct destiny?

Maybe I nurture it more

But I did mean it before

Broken all the pieces I've been shaping lately
Focused on the things that didn't make no sense
Guess that growing up was never meant to be easy
Yeah, I got used to doing everything sideways
Didn't really care about how anyone felt
Hiding my emotions down in different ashtrays

Oh, but what is lost ain't gone
No, you can't just let go
'Cause it's a part of you that will make you strong
Embrace your flaws
I'm not gonna fight back what I've become
Yeah, I've got bruises where I came from
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
I've been going way too hard on myself
Guess that it's the reason I've been feeling like hell
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars

I went down a road that only got me nowhere
I've seen every corner, every inch of this place
Being all alone it really got me thinking, maybe overthinking

No, you can't just let go

At ngayon, nand'yan ka na

Handa ako sa walang hanggan
'Di paaasahin, 'di ka sasaktan

At sa wakas ay nahanap ko na rin
Ang aking tanging hinihiling
Pangako sa'yo na ika'y uunahin
At hindi naitatanggi

Ang tadhanang nahanap ko sa'yong pagmamahal
Ang dudulot sa pag-ibig natin na magtatagal

At ngayon, nand'yan ka na

Don't expect it, you won't be hurt

I promise you that you will come first

What will make our love last longer

I bet she's braggin' to all her friends, sayin' you're so unique, hmm

So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she’s with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Ah) Hmm
Do you get déjà vu, huh?
Do you call her, almost say my name?
’Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
Another actress
I hate to think that I was just your type
And I bet that she knows Billy Joel
’Cause you played her ""Uptown Girl""
You're singin' it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her
In between the chorus and the verse (Ooh; I love you)

So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?

Wonder what I'll do when the cops come through
And the whiskey's run out
'Cause I've been lookin' at you since half past two
Wanna take this downtown?
This liquid courage got me way too honest
Put your phone on vibrate, let's catch a vibe, babe
While the sun's down
Hush now, I know we're a little too fucked up to stay still, love
Be as quiet as you can, 'cause if anyone sees
They'll just blow shit up
I don't gotta know if you're taken
I'll just let ya know bedroom's vacant
No one's gotta know, just us and the moon 'til the sun starts wakin'
Up's the only direction I see
As long as we keep this

Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low-key (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
You ain't even gotta lo- lo- lo- lo- lo- lo- lo-love me (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
Us in a king-size, keep it a secret
Say I'm your queen, I don't wanna leave this
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low-key

Wizard with words tellin' me my energy's so bewitchin'
So I'll go first, there's an open bar, let's close this distance
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh my, don't make me have to spell it all night
I don't really give a fuck 'bout all the 'he said, she said' bullshit
So pick your poison, love, let's go somewhere a little more exclusive
Take a shot, take a chance, take my hand, boy
Tension so intense like an asteroid
Be discreet, gotta dodge all the tabloids

Let's not think too much, there ain't no problems
So long as we keep this

Tellin' me how much you miss me

Go find a girl who wants to listen

So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So, I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position

Yo, 2Pac once asked, ""Is there a Heaven for a G?""
Well, now there is, word, 'cause he's up there to see
Moving around, he's chilling with Prince and James Brown
If our people are up in Heaven, their loving is raining down
The only force to save us from city was hip-hop
The only force that made us grimy and gritty was hip-hop
We all respect the world's religions and the laws they laid
But I know Scott La Rock's gonna come to my aid
See, these saints are great, but they're not where my heart be
When I call on the angels, I'm calling on Marcus Garvey
I'd rather call on Bob Marley, oh yes, sir
Kwame Ture, that's my real ancestor
Why call upon the spirits of oppressors
When you can call your own angels when you under pressure
See, when it comes to hip-hop, here's the lesson
Start praising your own people, hip-hop speaks from Heaven
Hip-hop speaks from Heaven
Tell me who you repping, yo, this another lesson, yo

Tell me who you repping, yo, this another lesson, yo
Go, hip-hop speaks from Heaven

Hey, hip-hop speaks from Heaven

So when I think of California, I'm seeing Eazy-E
When I think of Brooklyn, New York, I'm seeing B.I.G
When I'm thinking about the Bronx, I'm seeing Scott La Rock
We gon' praise they name forever and we gon' never stop
It's forever 2Pac, it's forever Heavy D
It's forever Big Pun, it's forever O.D.B
They was live, now deceased, from the West to the East
It's forever Phife Dawg, Big L rest in peace
What happens next, we shouting out Professor X
Shout out to Freaky Tah, shout out to Proof, big respect
We can't forget, so we bubble with joy
When we reminisce over you, Trouble T-Roy
Shout out to Keith Cowboy, Ms. Melodie all day
Shout out to J Dilla and Jam Master Jay
It's love I'm sending to you
Shout out to Guru, and Mr. Magic from the Juice Crew

I remember the day
Even wrote down the date, that I fell for you (Mm-hmm)
And now it's crossed out in red
But I still can't forget if I wanted to
And it drives me insane
Think I'm hearin' your name, everywhere I go
But it's all in my head

But you won't see me break, call you up in three days
Or send you a bouquet, sayin', ""It's a mistake""
Drink my troubles away, one more glass of champagne

I'm the first to say that I'm not perfect
And you're the first to say you want the best thing
But now I know a perfect way to let you go
Give my last hello, hope it's worth it

My best was just fine
How I tried, how I tried to be great for you
I'm flawed by design and you loved to remind me

A breath of relief, and I've realised

We try to avoid it
Such questions
And even if not sure
We continued our relationship

Now the story is over
Started to regret it
Everything seemed to blur
Don't know where to go
I told you so
It should have been the first time
I didn't hope, I didn't believe

We can't
Met but not destined
It is no longer possible
Let's not torture our hearts
Give up the fight‚ we can't‚ woah‚ woah-oh, oh

Because the feelings are heavy
Why don't we admit it yet?
Because of the first one
We know we have no fight

I told you so
It should have been the first time
I didn't hope, I didn't believe

We can't
Met but not destined
It is no longer possible
Let's not torture our hearts

Hindi, hindi ko kayang umibig muli
Habang-buhay na lang kitang hihintayin (Hihintayin)

Tinatanggi ko ang tadhana na kailangang mawala ka
Handa ako na ulitin sa'yo at aminin
Na wala nang ibang makahihigit pa
Lahat silang maganda, tila magkakamukha
Walang papantay sa'yo, tunay kagandahan mo
Bakit iniwan mo ako?
May mali ba sa sarili ko?
Paano iisipin?
'Di mo na 'ko kayang tanggapin
Hindi (Hindi), hindi ko kayang umibig muli
Habang-buhay na lang kitang hihintayin (Hihintayin)
Hindi, hindi, hindi ko kayang umibig muli
Habang-buhay na lang kitang hihintayin (Hihintayin)

At ang hirap lang mabuhay nang ganitong mag-isa
Maaga na 'kong nagising, walang madali lalo 'pag walang pera
Dahil minsan na akong naghirap habang sila'y nakasakay
Ako'y lumalakad ng ilang kilometro
Makauwi lang ng bahay
Gawin mo 'yon nang ilang taon
Magsawa ka nang mag-isa
Kinaya ko 'yon, ngunit bakit gano'n?
'Di ko alam ang gagawin ngayon

Hindi (Hindi), hindi ko kayang umibig muli
Habang-buhay na lang kitang hihintayin (Hihintayin)
Hindi, hindi, hindi ko kayang umibig muli

Hihintayin, hihintayin
Hihintayin

Sa bawat sandali na 'di ka na kapiling
Pinipilit ko, kinakaya kong harapin ang totoo
Na wala ka na at wala nang iba
Ang makapapalit pa sa pangarap nating habang-buhay magkasama

No, I can't fall in love again
I'll wait for you forever (Wait)

I defy fate to have to lose you
I am ready to repeat it to you and admit it
That no one else can surpass
They are all beautiful, they look alike
There is no match for you, you are truly beautiful
why did you leave me
Is there something wrong with me?
How to think?
You can't accept me anymore
No (No), I can't fall in love again
I'll wait for you forever (Wait)
No, no, I can't fall in love again
I'll wait for you forever (Wait)

And it's just hard to live like this alone
I woke up early, nothing is easy especially when there is no money
Because I had trouble once while they were riding
I walk a few kilometers
Just get home
Do that for a few years
Get bored alone
I can handle it, but why?
I don't know what to do now

No (No), I can't fall in love again
I'll wait for you forever (Wait)
No, no, I can't fall in love again
I'll wait for you forever (Wait)
Waiting, waiting
Will wait

Every moment you are no longer with me
I'm trying, I'm able to face the truth
That you are gone and there is no one else
The one that can change our dream of a lifetime together

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now
He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame
You might also like
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it (All too well)
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there

Ayy, ayy, ayy
I got a condo in Manhattan
Baby girl, what's happenin'?
You and your ass invited
So go on and get to clappin'
So pop it for a player
Pop, pop it for me
Turn around and drop it for a player
Drop, drop it for me
I'll rent a beach house in Miami (-ami)
Wake up with no jammies (Nope)
Lobster tail for dinner
Julio, serve that scampi (Julio!)
You got it if you want it
Got, got it if you want it
Said, you got it if you want it
Take my wallet if you want it now
Jump in the Cadillac, girl, let's put some miles on it
Anything you want, just to put a smile on it
You deserve it, baby, you deserve it all
And I'm gonna give it to you

Gold jewellery shinin' so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Sex by the fire at night
Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like

I'm talkin' trips to Puerto Rico (Bih)
Say the word, and we go (Say it)
You can be my freaka (Brrrt!)
Girl, I'll be your fleeko, Mamacita
I'll never make a promise that I can't keep
I promise that your smile ain't gon' ever leave
Shoppin' sprees in Paris
Everything 24 karats
Take a look in that mirror
Now tell me, who's the fairest?
Is it you? (Is it you?) Is it me? (Is it me?)

You know I want you
It's not a secret I try to hide
I know you want me
So don't keep sayin' our hands are tied
You claim it's not in the cards
And fate is pulling you miles away and out of reach from me
But you're here in my heart
So who can stop me if I decide that you're my destiny?

What if we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine?
Nothing could keep us apart
You'd be the one I was meant to find
It's up to you and it's up to me
No one can say what we get to be
So why don't we rewrite the stars?
Maybe the world could be ours tonight
You think it's easy?
You think I don't want to run to you?
But there are mountains
And there are doors that we can't walk through
I know you're wonderin' why
Because we're able to be just you and me within these walls
But when we go outside
You're gonna wake up and see that it was hopeless after all

No one can rewrite the stars
How can you say you'll be mine?
Everything keeps us apart
And I'm not the one you were meant to find
It's not up to you, it's not up to me
When everyone tells us what we can be
How can we rewrite the stars?
Say that the world can be ours tonight

Andiyan ka na naman
Ba't 'di ko maiwasang tumingin sa'yong liwanag
Nadarang nanaman sa'yong apoy
Bakit ba laging hinahayaan
Andiyan ka na naman
Ba't 'di ko maiwasang tumingin sa'yong liwanag
Nadarang nanaman sa'yong apoy
Handang masaktan kung kinakailangan

May lakad ka ba mamaya?
Puwede ka ba makasama sa pag-gagala
Kung sakaling 'di ka puwede
Sabagay, meron din akong ginagawa
Siguro nga napapaisip ka
Ba't ako nangangamusta
Ilang araw ka nang naroon sa panaginip ko
Nag-aalala lang ako baka sa'n ka mapunta
Pero mukhang ayos ka naman
Kahit 'di na kita abalahin pa
Ilang ama namin pa ba ang dapat
Para patago kang mag-alala sakin (uh)
Habang pinapantasya lamang nila
Ay mascara mo sa gabi At
Pitaka mo sa umaga
Yung ""ikaw"" sa likod ng kolorete
Pa din ang nangangahulugan
Sa salitang ""paraiso"" para sakin
Bakit kaya kayamanan ko pading kinikilala
Ang iyong pagtawa
Kahit na sa puso mo man ay
Ilang dosena na din ang kasya
Dati pa 'kong pinagdamutan ng kapalaran
Kaya 'di na bago sakin mawalan ng pag-asa
Ala-una ng umaga na naman
Tawagan mo na lang ulit ako
Kapag hindi na kayo magkasama
Andiyan ka na naman
Ba't di ko maiwasang tumingin sa'yong liwanag

Bakit ba laging hinahayaan
Andiyan ka na naman
Ba't di ko maiwasang tumingin sa'yong liwanag
Nadarang nanaman sa'yong apoy
Handang masaktan kung kinakailangan

May lakad ka ba mamaya
Sana madaanan mo ko pagkatapos
Sabihin mo ngayon ako'y makaka-asang
Dito ka dadalhin ng iyong sapatos
Kung ngayong gabi lang naman ang magiging dahilan
Ay handang-handa padin naman ako mamaos
Nakakaluwag ka man ay sa mas
Nakakalibang na paraan kita tutulungang makaraos
Bakit ka nagparamdam
Siguro 'di na kayo nilanggam
Ba't kaya 'di niya alam
Ang iyong halaga't kung ga'no ka kalinamnam
Iniwasan ko ma'ng matakam nang di halata
Ang hirap na magpabaya
Kapag tawag na ng laman ay nagbadya
Makipaglangit-lupa ng walang taya
Mata sa mata, bibig sa bibig
Mga ingay na tayo lang dalawa nakadinig
Nakatawang umidlip sa kama
Pero ba't wala ka na pagsapit ng umaga?

There you are again
Why can't I help but look at your light
Your fire has caught fire
Why is it always allowed?
There you are again
Why can't I help but look at your light
Your fire has caught fire
Willing to get hurt if necessary

Do you have a walk later?
Can you come along for the ride?
In case you can't
Anyway, I'm doing something too
Maybe it makes you think
Why am I saying hello?
How many days have you been there in my dream?
I'm just worried about where you might end up
But you seem fine
Even if I don't bother you anymore
How many more fathers should we have?
To keep you from worrying about me (uh)
While they only fantasize
Is your mascara at night And
Your wallet in the morning
The ""you"" behind the lipstick
Still means
In the word ""paradise"" for me
Why do I keep recognizing wealth?
Your laugh
Even in your heart
A few dozen will fit
I used to hate fate
So it's not new for me to lose hope
It's one o'clock in the morning again
Just call me again
When you are no longer together
There you are again
Why can't I help but look at your light
Your fire has caught fire
Why is it always allowed?
There you are again
Why can't I help but look at your light
Your fire has caught fire
Willing to get hurt if necessary

Do you have a walk later?
I hope you can pass me then
Tell me now I can hope
This is where your shoes will take you
If only tonight will be the reason
I'm still ready to clean
You are relieved at least
It's a fun way to help you get through
Why did you feel
Maybe you don't like it anymore
Why doesn't he know?
Your value is how good you are
I even avoided being greedy without being obvious
It's hard to let go
When the flesh calls, it is bad
Go heaven and earth without betting
An eye for an eye, a mouth for a mouth
We only heard noises
It was fun to take a nap in bed
But why are you gone by morning?

Up all night on my mind got me thinking
Wanna stay, can you give me a reason?
I don't think so, I don't think so
I'm in love with someone, but I'm not sure
She can love someone back the way they love her
I don't think so, I don't think so

Don't be mean, if you wanna go
You can leave and leave my heart alone
Waking up to nothing when you're super far from home
And I watch you fall asleep at night and lay there on my own
Got me begging for affection, all you do is roll your eyes
Broken down, I've had enough
If this is love, I don't want it

Give it time, c'mon babe, it's been ten months
You should know, do you know, know what you want?
I don't think so, I don't think so
Make it work, know it hurts, but I'll go there
Do the same, can you show me that you care?

I'm gonna need a little more from you

I still remember, third of December, me in your sweater
You said it looked better on me than it did you
Only if you knew, how much I liked you
But I watch your eyes as she

Walks by
What a sight for sore eyes, brighter than a blue sky
She's got you mesmerized while I die
Why would you ever kiss me?
I'm not even half as pretty
You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester
But you like her better
(Wish I were Heather)

Watch as she stands with her, holding your hand
Put your arm 'round her shoulder, now I'm getting colder
But how could I hate her? She's such an angel
But then again, kinda wish she were dead as she

Walks by
What a sight for sore eyes, brighter than a blue sky
She's got you mesmerized while I die

Why would you ever kiss me?

Well you done done me in; you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
Now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my bestest
Nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some
But I won't hesitate no more, no more

Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find
Love, love, love, love
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing
We're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be
Loved, love, love, love, loved

So I won't hesitate no more, no more

It could change, but this feels like, like the calm before the storm
Not that I don't wanna try, but I've been here before
Friends in town, phone's at home, I tell myself it's fine
Can't remember how you taste, slept alone too many nights

Where did we go wrong? I know we started out alright
Where did we go wrong? I swear I knew we'd last this time
Where did we go wrong? Oh, did you, did you change your mind?
How could you change your mind?
Who got inside your mind?

Where did we go wrong? I swear I knew we'd last this time
Where did we go wrong? Oh, did you, did you change your mind?
How could you change your mind?
Who got inside your mind?
Half my clothes are at your house, and I don't want them back
The smell of you is way too much, not gonna put my heart through that
I don't know how much time we got, I don't know how much to say
I don't know, tell me what you want, I want you to want me to stay

Where did we go wrong? I know we started out alright

What day is it? And in what month?
This clock never seemed so alive
I can't keep up and I can't back down
I've been losing so much time

'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to lose
And it's you and me and all other people
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you
All of the things that I want to say just aren't coming out right
I'm tripping on words
You've got my head spinning
I don't know where to go from here

'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to prove
And it's you and me and all other people
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you

There's something about you now
I can't quite figure out
Everything she does is beautiful
Everything she does is right

Saan nagsimulang magbago ang lahat?
Kailan nung ako'y 'di na naging sapat?
Ba't di mo sinabi nung una pa lang?
Ako ang kailangan, pero 'di ang mahal

Saan nagkulang ang aking pagmamahal?
Lahat ay binigay nang mapangiti ka lang
Ba't 'di ko nakita na ayaw mo na?
Ako ang kasama, pero hanap mo siya
At kung masaya ka sa piling niya
Hindi ko na pipilit pa
Ang tanging hiling ko lang sa kaniya
'Wag kang paluhain at alagaan ka niya

Saan natigil ang pagiging totoo?
Sa tuwing mababanggit na mahal mo ako
Ba't 'di mo inamin na merong iba?
Ako ang kayakap, pero isip mo siya

At kung masaya ka sa piling niya
Hindi ko na pipilit pa
Ang tanging hiling ko lang sakanya
'Wag kang paluhain, at alagaan ka niya

Ba't 'di ko naisip na merong hanggan?
Ako 'yung nauna, pero siya ang wakas

At kita naman sa'yong mga mata
Kung bakit pinili mo siya

Where did everything start to change?
When was I not enough?
Why didn't you say it in the first place?
I am needed, but not loved

Where was my love lacking?
Everything is given with just a smile on your face
Why didn't I see that you don't want it anymore?
I'm with you, but look for him
And if you are happy with him
I won't push anymore
My only request to him
Don't be sad and let him take care of you

Where does the realism stop?
Every time you mention that you love me
Why didn't you admit that there was someone else?
I'm the huggable one, but think about him

And if you are happy with him
I won't push anymore
My only request from him
Don't be sad, and let him take care of you

Why didn't I think there was a limit?
I was the first, but he is the end

And I see it in your eyes
Why did you choose him?

The heart is jumping
I went to heaven with joy
You are the companion
It melts just by looking at it
Holding it in my hand, I don't want to

Under the moon look and hold my hand
You will be slow danced
Until you realize it
I'm the one you need
And you want to manage
It seems to be rose red, your lips speak
It's good to stop time, it can be tied and handcuffed
Your looks, shines so much
Oh, you're a dream, don't want to wake up

Under the sky your name will be shouted
Under the moon look and hold my hand
You will be slow danced
Until you realize it
I'm the one you need
And you want to manage

Honey, you still remember
The first day the eyes met?
Records in the sky have come down
It seems that your light is shining
Of a storm in a lost heart

Because every time I close my eyes
Until the last step of the feet

Kapag naalala ko ang mga araw na magkasama tayong dalawa
Ngiti at luha sa'king mga mata, gano’n na pala tayo dati kasaya
'Yung tipong kapag tayo'y nagkatitigan
Mag-ngingitian para bang nahihibang
Mag-iingay kahit sobrang tahimik ng kapaligiran
Kahit may nagrereklamo na’y wala tayong pakialam
Panahong nando'n ka pa, laging pumupunta
'Di inaasahan may sorpresa ka laging dala
Ang saya-saya, ayoko lang pahalata
Kasi okay na naman ako basta makasama ka
Kaso lang wala na, pero alam ko na masaya ka na
Sa mundo ko, wala nang makakagawa
Makakatumbas ng 'yong napadama

Kaya salamat sa pag-ibig mo, pag-ibig mo
Lagi kang nasa puso't isip ko, isip ko
At inaamin ko na namimiss kita, na namimiss kita (At inaamin ko)

When I remember the days we spent together
Smiles and tears in your eyes, that's how happy we used to be
The kind when we stare at each other
Smile like crazy
Make noise even if the environment is very quiet
Even if someone complains, we don't care
When you were still there, always coming
'Unexpectedly, you always have a surprise
It's fun, I just don't want it to be obvious
Because I'm okay as long as I'm with you
It's just that it's gone, but I know you're happy
In my world, nothing can be done
You can match what you felt

So thank you for your love, your love
You are always in my heart and mind, my mind
And I admit that I miss you, that I miss you (And I admit)
To me you are still my baby, my baby
Even if you are no longer with me, with me
I promise I'll still pray for you, I'll still pray for you

Because I can't stand it anymore, love
I'm slowly missing you, love
No matter how many times they entertain
You and I still want to kiss you, love
I don't agree not to be with you
If you can hug, you are better than a couple

Got back together, now you making a family, listen

And not nann one of these hoes gon' love you
But I hope one prove me wrong, and if so
Then God, please bless that bitch soul
Oh, I will, mademoiselle
I'll throw a stack if you love me
All them bullshit congrats on my Lambo and I still say, mercy
And she a slave to the whips and chain
And then the punchline is slave, the hoes that fall asleep to Cadie
All of 'em, yeah, I'm still learning 'bout all that, teach me
I got inappropriate questions for you before you leave, 'bout what's ahead
You one hunnah? Same story, create a player ass nigga
Threw all yo' money in the club, fundraiser ass nigga
That's far, not smart to keep bricks in the glass house
I'm Wizard Kelly big facing, you boys still Penny Proud
And I watch her mouth move when she talk
Now imagine if she ask if I want to fuck
I'm a different nigga Piccolo, boy, we don't even bleed the same color blood
And I don't condone these unnamed hoes in the castle
Doing dirt under my InuYasha nails, girl be my Kagome
May wanna see you if this bitch don't get put on Davenport
We moving too fast, gotta pause in that pussy like CatDog
And that feel like a mouth, you Deidara with yo' hands, ho
Hurt to let you go, but it feel good to send you home to yo' man smelling like 'Ports
Pussy lips smooth as the Panamera seats
Don't even gotta crack a leg, smell that air freshener, peaches and cream
Know I seen you at the Peachfuzz, last couple of weeks
I know you remember me, I know you remember me
(I know you do!)
Now maybe them lil' plans, to run off and get married
Don't sound too far-fetched, now that you don't got that man
I got a condo on my wrist, all my juggs bought my apartment
And I got a townhouse with some kids, with yo' name right on it, shit
And I can't even move my arms, close my eyes, you all I see
And I'll paint that pussy if you call on me
Grown man, lost mind, find a Xan
I was tryna find out what I was kissing, now my girl period missing
Xan with that lean, nothing but Irene
These hoes going crazy when I'm on the scene
Boy, tighten up, I don't fuck wit'cha, don't make me fuck yo' bitch
And I keep my fye on me, but I'm too high to lift that shit
Girl, you'll put all yo' problems on me
This liq is gon' end up on me
Take my whole squad out to dinner, feel good to say, errythang be on me
It's Xan with that lean, nothing but Irene
Looking at these niggas crazy, bitch, I'm on a bean

And I got all these diamonds on me, all these crystals on me
And my third bitch named Ruby
She got a mouth full of gold cause I strap up when she gimme head
Her insides made of glitter, my mouth shine when I lick her
And these loser niggas be tryna win me over
It's that draw ass pussy, it's hentai ass niggas
Bringing back shit that got deaded, ol' Dende ass niggas, bitch
No, no, I can't fuck with it
No Twitter love that I can't see writing me shit
She found a nigga on Instagram, tap it more than twice, she start liking shit
And I'm pissing yellow DM, and I'm aiming past yo' toilet seat
Bathroom in y'all love-nest, she put her mouth on this sick dick
I fucked yo' ho, I think I love her, spending time for hours
And if I front you an O of strong, is that equivalent to buying flowers?
She smoke Lauderdale kush, so even when I'm gone, feel like I'm at home
And, no, the fame ain't got nothing to do with yo number not being in my phone
And she's so one-of-a-kind, boy, I'll drop her off later
Got me asking questions 'bout the girl next door like, who the neighbors?
Love the soil in the Sprite, and she only pop a quarter
Baby nine hollow-tip, the bitch sound like something I ordered
And there ain't no old Bank$, you don't know the old shit
You losing touch with yo'self, but, bitch, I'm beating my dick
New artist? You never heard of Basquiat, bitch?
Walking 'round all these pussies, just to get my feet wet
And she see traces of her favorite color through the green bottle
Miami Beach water, sponge-bathing, down at the Bikini Bottom
No, these niggas don't hold no guns
These niggas just want me hold my tongue
But let me vibe, I got school in the morning

Oy yeah
Beautiful
I remember it like it just happened
I could've sworn it was a dream
But in reality it hit me like a nightmare
Or at least that's how it seemed
I just got a grip on our relationship
We was ironing things out, started picking up steam
And when we didn't need it is when it all got heated
And we both said some things that we probably didn't mean
Then God intervened, guess more was at stake
Thought we left nothing over, he put more on the plate
She came home from the doctor with news I've been wanting
Says family was incoming, she's pregnant, twins coming
But that's gotta be a lie
She sighed, couldn't stop the tears coming from her eyes
That birth control she on, for them it's suicide
As long as it's still inside, two of them wouldn't survive
Hard turn from memorable to cynical
Picturing clothes for what would've been identical
Similar outfits, similar names
My deceased kids' ultrasound in a frame
So I'm deprived of my chance to be a better dad
Staring at my twins that I never had
I shed a tear, looking up in the sky
Even though y'all just got here, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, so long, farewell
But it's not the end of the chapter
Goodbye, goodbye, so long, farewell
I'll see you again in the afterlife

My biological sperm donor, didn't wanna be a daddy
So he hopped in his Caddy and turned corners on us
Turned on us out the clear blue
His last memory of his son is seeing me through his rearview
I still love him yo, but I love his brother more
My uncle showed me love no one could know
Young and poor with a tougher road
To suffer hunger was nothing but Unc' would hold
Us down, help moms lift the motherload
I got grown and
I used to wonder what it would be like to speak to pops as a grown man
He provided that feeling, told me to take my career into my own hands
He was there when I had no fans
My cellphone rings, and after I answer
A voice says ""Your uncle's been diagnosed with cancer""
Worst news in my life
Him and chemo going 12 rounds with a disease and they're both losing the fight
I'm rushing up to Cedars-Sinai
Praying for a miracle, I don't wanna see my idol die
Before he did, the look in his eyes
Said ""Even though you just got here, goodbye""
You might also like
Goodbye, goodbye, so long, farewell
But it's not the end of the chapter
Goodbye, goodbye, so long, farewell
I'll see you again in the afterlife

I'll see you again in the afterlife
Someday in heaven we will reunite
The flesh disappears but the soul survives
Till next time, my friend, farewell, goodbye

I walked in your daughter's house, knowing that you gone
But still looking out the corner of my eye, hoping you're on the couch
That call felt like I was beef that had got shot up
Ironic, I was on tour with Tech N9ne and Slaughterhouse
D tried to talk to me, Crystal rubbed my back, as they was pouring out
I caught the next thing soaring out
Now I'm in the air, in the midwest somewhere
They said turbulence was severe, I don't know what they talking bout
I ain't feel a bump, body numb, mind drifting
I'm sniffling, asthma acting up, I'm whistling
I'm wishing my mother's face looked so much different
I'm kissing my son, my aunt pacing in the kitchen
My vision blurry, still I saw your face clear
What a loss, this time I did more than waste beer
Michelle's strong, she held on, we got all the way there
Then we walked in, she fell on the floor, this ain't fair
You was the voice when I considered them thoughts that ain't clear
Hey granny, I was fifth row at the Grammy's
An award they ain't hand me, but I sat behind Will
And right in front of Wayne, and got seen by the family
I miss the early morning convos, believe me
Regis on the TV, and the best baked ziti
But you had an all white affair, grandpa's all fly
Even though you been got there, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, so long, farewell
But it's not the end of the chapter
Goodbye, goodbye, so long, farewell
I'll see you again in the afterlife16Embed","Goodbye Lyrics

'Di na mapakali
Ikaw lang naman ang ninanais
'Di ba nalilito ang puso mo kung saan na papunta?
Sa akin ba sinta?

'Wag mo sanang isipin
Na parang wala lang sa'kin
Ang lahat nating pinagsamahan
Isasayaw kita na para bang ito
Na ang panghuli natin, sinta
'Wag kang mag-alala
'Di kita hahayaang mag-isa
Sasamahan nga kita
Sa dulo ng ligaya

'Di pa ba halata
Na iba ang ihip ng hangin dito?
Kung pwede lang sabihin
Ng diretsahan ang aking gusto
Teka, ang bulag mo naman
Kung 'di pa rin na sisilayan
Nagbago na ang pagtingin

'Wag mo sanang isipin
Na parang wala lang sa'kin

Isasayaw kita na para bang ito
Na ang panghuli natin, sinta
'Wag kang mag-alala

Looking at me
It's like flying in the air
'Can't be bothered anymore
Only you are desired
'Isn't your heart confused where it's going?
Is it mine dear?

Don't think about it
Like it's just not there
All of us together
I'll make you dance like this
That's our last, darling
'Do not worry
'I won't leave you alone
I will accompany you
At the end of the holiday

'Isn't it obvious?
That the wind blows differently here?
If only I could say
What I want is direct
Wait, you're blind
If you still don't look at it
The view has changed

Don't think about it
Like it's just not there
All of us together

I'll make you dance like this
That's our last, darling

There goes my hands shaking

There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered, ""Have we met?""
Across the room, your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

2AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake

Ito ay isang dalangin
'Wag sanang ipagkait
Matagpuan na ang hanap
Na pangarap, na pangarap

Kasalanan nga bang umibig?
Parusang lungkot ang hatid
Lamig ng hangin ang yakap
T'wing gabi, t'wing gabi
Pinipilit mang itago, hindi kayang maglaho
Ang mga katanungang tulad ng

Bakit parang sa'kin lamang may galit?
Madayang tadhanang iyong pansinin
Wala na bang karapatan
Na pagbigyan ang hiling?

Lumilipad ang aking isip
Bigla na lang napapailing
Wala na ngang mapagtuunan
Ng pansin, ng pansin

Pinipilit mang itago, 'di kayang maglaho

It is a prayer
Don't deny it
The quest has been found
That dream, that dream

Is it really a sin to fall in love?
Sadness is a punishment
The wind is cold in the hug
It's night, it's night
Even if you try to hide it, you can't disappear
Questions like

Why does it seem like I'm the only one with anger?
Devious destiny you notice
Are there no rights?
To grant the request?

My mind is flying
All of a sudden it shook
There is nothing to focus on
Attention, attention

Trying to hide it, it can't disappear
Questions like, like

Why does it seem like I'm the only one with anger?
Destined to notice you
Are there no rights?

Oh, I've been on the road for hours all alone
Just to get to you, mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Love
Oh, I could do this every day
So come my way (Yeah)
Say a prayer
Say a prayer before I turn off the lights, mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, no
Get undressed (Get undressed)
Get undressed, there ain't no reason to hide (Reason to hide)
'Cause not everybody's obsessed with a body
I'm up for the beauty and light from within
You have me already, this ain't ordinary
My hands get unsteady every time you let me in
I've been attached with the feeling of love reciprocating
And waking up with you by my side
Stuck in the same page for ages
But baby you're ageless
And fate is in our hands somehow

I'm happy with you
I'm happy with you (Happy with you)
I'm happy with you (Happy with you)

What I would do to feel your heat
You turn a glow into a fire
My love don't expire, you're my lifeline (Lifeline)
You are all I crave and all I seek
Yet I'll take it day by day, don't give a fuck 'bout the wait

Minsan oo, minsan hindi
Minsan tama, minsan mali

Tumingin sa'king mata
Magtapat ng nadarama
'Di gusto ika'y mawala
Dahil handa akong ibigin ka
Kung maging tayo
Sa'yo lang ang puso ko
Walang ibang tatanggapin
Ikaw at ikaw pa rin
May gulo ba sa'yong isipan?
'Di tugma sa nararamdaman

'Di gusto ika'y mawala

Kailangan ba kitang iwasan?
Sa t'wing lalapit may paalam
Ibang anyo sa karamihan
Iba rin 'pag tayo, iba rin 'pag tayo lang

Unang araw palang minahal na kita
Bakit ba ganito ang aking nadama
Di man kita lubusan pang kilala
Eh ano naman basta mahal kita

Unang araw sa school ako'y nasa eskwelahan
Uniporme ay cool baka may maeksenahan
Syempre meron bagong chicks ngayon nagenroll
Kaso yung iba mukang pang shake rattle and roll (Oh)
Pero iisa ang agaw pansin
Isang babaeng kumakain magisa sa canteen
Tapos lalo pa kong natuwa at lalong sumaya
Nung nalaman ko ang crush ko classmate ko pala
Haha ngayon nga madiskartehan
Wala akong pake kung magtaray o maginarte yan
Basta gusto ko lang sabihin salitang nakakasado
Sa exam ng puso ko alam mo ba ikay pasado
Pero teka lang pangalan mo di ko pa alam
""Hoy mister wag kang maingay"" tumahimik ka ma'am
Anyway di ko pa rin alam pangalan mong banal
Pero pwede ba tawag ko nalang sayo mahal

Bakit ba ganito ang aking nadama

Di ko dama ang pagod ko kahit na mag P. E
Pag topic ay P. C. ito'y hindi easy
Kaya ika'y busy pero ako'y sisi-
Ngit pa rin sa oras mo kahit ikaw ay maines
Kase ikaw bumubusog sa puso ko kapag recess
Kung eskwelahan ang puso ko ikaw ang principal
Dahil sinusunod lamang nito kanyang minamahal
Daig ko pa ang first honor kapag nakita kita
Ikaw solution sa problem sa matematika
Ng buhay ko kase ikaw plus ako equals for better
Multiply by tiwala at love equals forever
At wala ng pwedeng magdivide sa ating dalawa
Kase sa aklat ng Sibika tayo'y nakatalaga

Unang araw palang minahal na kita
Bakit ba ganito ang aking nadama
Di man kita lubusan pang kilala
Eh ano naman basta mahal kita

Tumatangge ako sa tropa pagsinabeng cutting tayo
Kase misyon ko saking pagpasok maging tayo
Yayayain lang nila ko sa bilyarang kalapitan
Bakit pa ko dun sasamakung sayong tabe kalangitan
Di ba tama aking katuwiran
Sa eskwelahan dun lang kita natatabihan
Kapag ikaw ang seatmate ko ayoko ng lumisan
Sana dito nalang tayo at walang uwian (Damn)
Baliw na ba ko hay nako lagot
Saking assignment, quiz at exam pangalan mo sagot
Lagi kong hinahanap ang yong essence at presence
Kase kinukumpleto mo ang nonsense na sentence
Kaya di na aabsent you're the angel God sent
Ayos ba ang accent syempre laging present
Di nawawala sa school laging lumalapag
Kase ikaw ang dahilan kung bat ako nagsisipag
Unang araw palang minahal na kita
Bakit ba ganito ang aking nadama
Di man kita lubusan pang kilala
Eh ano naman basta mahal kita

Ika'y iba sa lahat masasabeng ibang klase
At salamat sapagkat ika'y aking naging kaklase
At ikaw ngayon ang subject dito sa aking rap
Kung hindi ka nakilala malamang ako'y nadrop
Kase tamad akong binatang sawa sa eskwelahan
Ngunit ikaw ay estudyante don kaya may kwenta yan
Gumawa ako ng project tulang ipapabasa
Di ito para kay ma'am sayo ko to papasa
Sana pumasa ako sayo
Sana magreview ka rin na umaasa ko sayo
At ang mahalin kita hindi ko yon pinagaralan
Dahil nadama ko yon ng kusa at agad agaran
Classmate kong mahal sana maisip mo na
Matamis mong oo ang tuturing kong diploma
At bago ka mawalay sakin sa bakasyon
School year na kasama ka sa puso ko babakas yon

Unang araw palang minahal na kita
Bakit ba ganito ang aking nadama
Di man kita lubusan pang kilala
Eh ano naman basta mahal kita

Nagbigay ng kaligayahan

Pride Of The Sapro Crew
Wait, are you studying?
YES
Crazy, what's your course?
Astronaut
Why astronaut?
I will go to the sun
On the day? Is it hot there?
I'm not going to go there at night
Wait, I have another song to make
Okay game!
Pride of the sagpro krew
It's the first day I've loved you
Why did I feel this way?
I don't even know you completely yet
What if I just love you?

I was at school on the first day of school
Uniform is cool, maybe there will be a scene
Of course there are new chicks enrolled now
The other case looks like shake rattle and roll (Oh)
But the attention is the same
A woman eating alone in the canteen
Then I was even happier and happier
When I found out my crush was my classmate
Haha now be strategic
I don't care if it's a joke or an act
I just want to say a sad word
In the exam of my heart, do you know you passed?
But wait, I don't know your name yet
""Hey, mister, don't be noisy"" you shut up, ma'am
Anyway, I still don't know your holy name
But can I call you dear?

It's the first day I've loved you
Why did I feel this way?
I don't even know you completely yet
What if I just love you?

We have the 2nd subject in the lab
I'm not listening, I'm staring at my love
Yes, I love you L-O-V-E
I don't feel tired even when doing P.E
If the topic is PC, it's not easy
So you're busy but I'll blame-
It's still dark in your time even if you're Maines
Because you fill my heart during recess
If my heart is a school, you are the principal
Because it only obeys his beloved
I'll beat the first honor when I see you
You are the solution to the math problem
In my life, you plus me equals for better
Multiply by trust and love equals forever
And nothing can divide us both
Because we are assigned to the book of Civics

It's the first day I've loved you
Why did I feel this way?
I don't even know you completely yet
What if I just love you?

I reject the troop when they say we are cutting
Because it was my mission from the beginning to become us
They'll just invite me to the nearby billiards
Why should I go to your sky?
Isn't my righteousness correct?
I only saw you at school
When you are my seatmate I don't want to leave
I hope we're here and there's no home (Damn)
Am I crazy, I'm so angry
From assignments, quizzes and exams, your name is the answer
I'm always looking for your essence and presence
Because you are completing the nonsense sentence
That's why I won't be absent anymore, you're the angel God sent
Is the accent okay, of course it's always present
Not missing from school, always landing
Because you are the reason why I work hard
It's the first day I've loved you
Why did I feel this way?
I don't even know you completely yet
What if I just love you?

You are different from everyone else, you can say a different class
And thank you because you became my classmate
And now you are the subject of my rap
If I didn't meet you, I probably would have been dropped
Because I'm a lazy young man fed up with school
But you are a student, so that makes sense
I made a poetry project to be read
This is not for ma'am, I will pass it on to you
I hope I pass you
I hope you will also review that I am counting on you
And I didn't learn to love you
Because I felt that voluntarily and immediately
My dear classmate, I hope you can imagine
Sweet yes, I'll consider it a diploma
And before you leave me on vacation
School year with you in my heart, that will be the end

It's the first day I've loved you
Why did I feel this way?
I don't even know you completely yet
What if I just love you?

(My classmate)
Gave happiness
So what I want is for you to always be there
I hope even we are far apart
(classmate)
remember me

If I went and hurt my body, baby, would you love me the same?

I need you here to stay

Crying at the lake
Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden?
Oh, and if I could take it all back
I swear that I would pull you from the tide

Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
I said no (I said no), I said no (I said no)
Listen close, it's a no

Or step on stage one by one

Haft way house, you know what I mean

Ewan ko kung pa'no ko bibitbitin
'Yung pagtingin ko kasi kung hanggang tingin lang ay bitin (Oh)
Ayoko rin naman 'to kimkimin kaso mukhang
Hindi ko pa rin 'to sa'yo kayang banggitin
At baka isnabin mo lang at 'di mo pansinin
Bitin kahit na empi, beer at gin ang inumin
'Yung tapang ay wala pa rin, sa'n ko hihiramin
Kahit maglasing wala rin kung paggising ko duwag pa rin
Pa'no sasama kung hindi ako nag-aaya
Pa'no tatama kung hindi ako tumataya
Minsan iniisip ko na 'wag na lang kaya
Kaso 'yung isip ko ay nagbabago din maya-maya
At sobra sa pag-asa kulang sa kumpyansa
Kaya mukhang malabong magka-tyansa (Tyansa)
Gusto ko lang naman ay maging Popoy mo Basha
'Yan ang matagal ko na pantasya
Matagal na kitang sinusundan, tinititigan at hindi maiwasan
Na ikaw ay 'di tingnan sa malayuan
At pinag-iisipan ko kung anong paraan
Para ikaw ay malapitan kaso malayo ang pagitan
Hanggang kailan kaya mag-aabang kung may mapapala (Oh)
Sa'king ginagawa na pagkatumaya ay 'wag mapahiya

'Di lang ako kumikibo, matagal ng tumitibok
Ang puso ko para sa'yo kaso minsan kumikirot (Woo)
'Di ko kasi masabi, 'di ako umaarte lang
'Di ko lang alam kung papaano aatake
Kasi baka naman ako ay tablahin
Kaya tinatak sa isip ko na 'wag nang tangkain
Panaginip lang lahat ng 'yon ako ay tampalin
Para gising na ako tamang panahon aantayin
Ko na lamang kasi wala naman masama sa magtyaga (Woo)
Kung para sa akin ka, eh 'di mag-aabang ako
Hanggang sa merong mapala
Kaso wala naman magaganap lalo't na 'pag wala ako ginawa
Tsaka baka mamuti lang ang mata
'Pag nag-antay ng himala (Oh)
'Di naman malabo na mapansin mo 'ko kapag 'di ako nagtatago
Kailangan ko lamang na maging matapang
Kung gusto ko na magka-tayo
Wala naman kasing ibang paraan
Kung sa takot ay magpapatalo
Kawawa lang ako puro lang tingin sa malayo
Kailangan ko yatang magbago kasi

Kay tagal na din pala kung iisipin mo
Kaso hindi mo pala 'to alam, sinong sisisihin ko
Kundi sarili ko na labis ang takot na baka mapahiya lang
Torpe man akong ituring ay wala akong pakialam
Sa sasabihin ng mga hibang na walang pake sa nararamdaman
Sana hindi niyo ito maramdaman
Na mahal kita ng hindi mo alam
Nabihag mo kasi ganda mo pang-fantasy

Pa'no ba kita mapapa-ibig (Mapapa-ibig)

Half way house, you know what I mean

I don't know how to carry it
The way I look because if I look at it, I'll be hanged (Oh)
I don't want to hide it either, it seems
I still can't mention it to you
And maybe you just add it and ignore it
Hang even empi, beer and gin to drink
I still don't have the courage, I'll borrow it
Even if I get drunk, I'm still a coward when I wake up
How can I come if I don't want to?
What if I don't bet?
Sometimes I think 'don't do it anymore'
It's just that my mind changes after a while
And too much hope and too little confidence
So it seems unlikely to have a chance (Chance)
I just want you to be Popoy Basha
That's my long time fantasy
I've been following you for a long time, staring and can't help it
That you are not seen from afar
And I'm thinking in what way
For you to be close when the distance is far
How long can you wait for something to be blessed (Oh)
Don't be ashamed of what you are doing

I'm just not moving, I'm throbbing for a long time
My heart for you sometimes hurts (Woo)
I can't say because I'm not just acting
I just don't know how to attack
Because I might be beaten
So it stuck in my mind not to try anymore
It's all just a dream, I'll slap you
It's like I'm awake and waiting for the right time
I'll just do it because there's nothing wrong with being patient (Woo)
If you're for me, I won't wait
Until there is luck
Nothing will happen, especially if I don't do anything
Besides, the eyes might just be white
When waiting for a miracle (Oh)
It's not that you'll notice me when I'm not hiding
I just need to be brave
If I want to be together
There is no other way
If you are afraid, you will lose
I'm just poor, just looking away
I think I need to change

And I'm thinking in what way

How long can you wait for something to be blessed (Oh)
Don't be ashamed of what you are doing

Because it's been a while if you think about it
You don't know, who am I to blame?
But I myself am so afraid that I might just be embarrassed
Even if I'm considered stupid, I don't care
As crazy people will say that there is no point in feeling
I hope you don't feel it
That I love you without knowing
You are captivating because you are beautiful in fantasy
That's what I'm having trouble with because it's simple
How can I make you fall in love (Mapapaibig)
With eyes that can't stare (Can't stare)
Maybe my strategy is to fool around
Cause I can't stop you from being alone with you (I'm alone)
How can I talk to you (Can talk)
I don't think you might be surprised (You might be surprised)
'When I get close to my chest, it's matic
I just want you to know
It's been a long time since I saw you
I've been following you for a long time, staring and can't help it
That you are not seen from afar

And she purses her lips, bats her eyes
And she plays with me sittin there slacked jaw
And nothing to say
'Cause I love her with all that I am
And my voice shakes along with my hands
'Cause she's all that I see and she's all that I need

Nung araw kay tamis ng ating buhay
Puno ng saya at ng kulay
'Di mauulit muli
Ang oras kapag hinayaang lumipas
Madarama mo hanggang bukas
'Di mababawi muli

Ang dami-daming bagay na hindi naman kailangan
Kung pwede lang bawasan natin ang mga tampuhan
Hindi mo lang alam, hindi mo ba nararanasan?
Kahapon sana natin 'di mo na pinahirapan
Patawad muli, 'di na muli
Ang oras kapag hinayaang lumipas
Madarama mo hanggang bukas
'Di mababawi muli, 'di na muli
At natapos ang himas ng sandali
'Di kukubli aking tinig
Nang lumipas na't 'di man lang nasabi
Salamat hanggang sa muli, ohh

That day was the sweetness of our life
Full of fun and color
'It won't happen again
The time when let pass
You will feel it until tomorrow

A lot of things that are not necessary
If only we could reduce the obstacles
You just don't know, don't you experience it?
I wish you wouldn't have tortured us yesterday

You will feel it until tomorrow
'I can't take it back, 'never again

Parang tangang kausap ang tala at buwan

Natutong lumipad kahit pagod at sugatan

Nadala na lang sa puro pangako
Baka pwede lang kahit isang saglit
Masabi lang na merong konting pagtingin
Baka pwede lang kahit pa pasaring
Sa sarili ko'y magsisinungaling

Naghihintay ng meron sa gitna ng kawalan
Natutong lumipad kahit pagod at sugatan

The note and the moon seem to be talking stupidly
Waiting for something in the middle of nothingness
Learned to fly even when tired and injured
When I get off the ground, I will just leave it

Nothing has changed
We lost again
That's really it
Just got carried away with pure promises
Maybe just for a moment
It can only be said that there is a little look
Maybe it's even possible
I will lie to myself

Waiting for something in the middle of nothingness
Learned to fly even when tired and injured
When I get off the ground, I will just leave it

With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss

I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
The testaments they told
The moon and its eclipse
And Superman unrolls
A suit before he lifts
But I'm not the kind of person that it fits

She said, where d'you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?

I don't know what it is that you've done to me
But it's caused me to act in such a crazy way
Whatever it is that you do when you do what you're doing
It's a feeling that I don't understand

'Cause my heart starts beating triple time
With thoughts of loving you on my mind
I can't figure out just what to do
When the cause and cure is you, you, ohh
I get so weak in the knees, I can hardly speak
I lose all control and something takes over me
In a daze and it's so amazing
It's not a phase, I want you to stay with me
By my side, I swallow my pride
Your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet
Can't explain why your loving makes me weak

Time after time, after time I try to fight it
But your love is strong, it keeps on holding on
Resistance is down when you're around, cries fading
In my condition, I don't want to be alone

Cause my heart starts beating triple time
With thoughts of loving you on my mind
I can't figure out just what to do
When the cause and cure is you

I get so weak in the knees, I can hardly speak
I lose all control and something takes over me
In a daze and it's so amazing

Reserve energy, if it's negative you shouldn't shine-share anymore

Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there, and I thought
""Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?""
Ayy

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mmm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
Oh, no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing, like
""Oh my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mmm

Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there, and I thought
""Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?""
Ayy

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mmm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
Oh, no
You might also like
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing, like
""Oh my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mmm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Oh)
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless (Oh-oh), mmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane (Insane)
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

Smile even when forced
Even on purpose
You hurt me, sometimes
Every moment
Am I struggling like you?
Especially thinking about you?
I can't forget anymore
Every moment

And leaving, coming back
And it will be said again
Love you and tell
Even if it hurts again
On departure
I will return
And I hope so
In a beautiful memory
Vision is beautiful
I hope it will be granted
It's destiny
Every moment
Go along with the sudden excitement
The surprise was overwhelming
True love regardless
Every moment

And leaving, coming back
And it will be said again
Love you and tell
Even if it hurts again

I will return
And I hope so

Wala nang dating pagtingin
Sawa na ba sa aking lambing?
Wala ka namang dahilan
Bakit bigla na lang nang-iwan?
'Di na alam ang gagawin
Upang ika'y magbalik sa'kin
Ginawa ko naman ang lahat
Bakit bigla na lang naghanap?

Hindi magbabago
Pagmamahal sa iyo
Sana'y pakinggan mo
Ang awit ng pusong ito
Tulad ng mundong hindi tumitigil sa pag-ikot
Pag-ibig 'di mapapagod
Tulad ng ilog na hindi tumitigil sa pag-agos
Pag-ibig 'di matatapos

Alaala'y bumabalik, mga panahong nasasabik
Sukdulang mukha mo ay laging na sa panaginip
Bakit biglang pinagpalit?
Pagsasamaha'y tila nawaglit
Ang dating walang hanggan
Nagkaroon ng katapusan

Hindi magbabago
Pagmamahal sa iyo
Sana'y pakinggan mo

No more looking back
Tired of my tenderness?
You have no reason
Why did you suddenly leave?
Don't know what to do
So that you can return to me
I did everything
Why suddenly search?

Will not change
Love you
I hope you listen
The song of this heart
Like the world that never stops spinning
Love never gets tired
Like a river that never stops flowing
Love never ends

Memories come back, exciting times
Your ultimate face is always in dreams
Why suddenly changed?
The association seems to have been disturbed
The former is eternal
There was an end

Will not change
Love you
I hope you listen

어느 날 세상이 멈췄어
아무런 예고도 하나 없이
봄은 기다림을 몰라서
눈치 없이 와버렸어
발자국이 지워진 거리
여기 넘어져있는 나
혼자 가네 시간이
미안해 말도 없이, yeah
오늘도 비가 내릴 것 같아
흠뻑 젖어버렸네
아직도 멈추질 않아
저 먹구름보다 빨리 달려가
그럼 될 줄 알았는데
나 겨우 사람인가 봐
몹시 아프네
세상이란 놈이 준 감기
덕분에 눌러보는 먼지 쌓인 되감기
넘어진 채 청하는 엇박자의 춤
겨울이 오면 내쉬자
더 뜨거운 숨

끝이 보이지 않아
출구가 있긴 할까?
발이 떼지질 않아 않아, oh
잠시 두 눈을 감아
여기 내 손을 잡아
저 미래로 달아나자

Like an echo in the forest
하루가 돌아오겠지

One day the world stopped
without any notice
Spring doesn't know how to wait
I came without notice
A street where footprints have been erased
I'm falling here
Time to go alone
I'm sorry without a word, yeah
It looks like it will rain today
I'm drenched
still won't stop
Run faster than those dark clouds
I thought it would be
I guess I'm just a human
it hurts so bad
The cold that the world gave me
Thanks to you, I press the dusty rewind
A dance of off-beat
Let's exhale when winter comes
hotter breath

I can't see the end
Will there be an exit?
I can't move my feet, oh
close your eyes for a moment
hold my hand here
Let's run away to that future

Like an echo in the forest
the day will come
as if nothing happened
Yeah, life goes on

Take it slow, but it's not typical
He already knows that my love is fire
His heart was a stone, but then his hands roam
I turned him to gold and took him higher

Well, I'll be your daydream, I'll be your favorite things
We could be beautiful
Get drunk on the good life, I'll take you to paradise
Say you'll never let me go
Deep in my bones, I can feel you
Take me back to a time only we knew, hideaway
We could waste the night with an old film
Smoke a little weed on my couch in the back room, hideaway
Say you'll never let me go

I saw you in another's arm
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said something to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do

Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're moving on with someone new
'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself
You're happier, aren't you?

Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody need you like I do
I know that there's others that deserve you
But my darling, I am still in love with you

That obvious love, love
Give me more, give me some more
Hanging on your own, at the edge of the cliff
If you say one word, do it again like hell
That warm trembling, bright red excitement
It might be like heaven
You might not get in it

Look at me, look at you Who hurts more?
You smart? (You smart?) Who? You are
If tears of blood flow from your eyes
So sorry (So sorry) Who? You are
What should I do, I can't stand the weak me
With both eyes closed
I need to stop loving

Let's kill this love!
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

What if I told you that I've fallen?

But don't mind me I'm just falling, I'll get back up on my own
Please don't say my name, help me put out this flame

I'm still a fan even though I was salty
Hate to see you with some other broad, know you happy
Hate to see you happy if I'm not the one drivin'

I'm so mature, I'm so mature
I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
I don't want none, I just want you
If I can't have you, no one should, I might
I might kill my ex, not the best idea
His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?
I might kill my ex, I still love him, though
Rather be in jail than alone

I get the sense that it's a lost cause
I get the sense that you might really love her
The text gon' be evidence, this text is evidence
I try to ration with you, no murders, no crime of passion
But, damn, you was out of reach
You was at the farmer's market with your perfect peach
Now I'm in amazement, playin' on my patience
Now you layin' face-down, got me singin' over a beat

Going back to the corner where I first saw you
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move
Got some words on cardboard, got your picture in my hand
Saying, ""If you see this girl, can you tell her where I am?""
Some try to hand me money, they don't understand
I'm not broke, I'm just a broken-hearted man
I know it makes no sense, what else can I do?
And how can I move on when I'm still in love with you?

'Cause if one day you wake up, and find that you're missing me
And your heart starts to wonder where on this Earth I could be
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
And you'll see me waiting for you, on the corner of the street
So I'm not moving
I'm not moving
Policeman says, ""Son, you can't stay here""
I say, ""There's someone I'm waiting for
If it's a day, a month, a year""
Gotta stand my ground, even if it rains or snows
If she changes her mind, this is the first place she will go

'Cause if one day you wake up, and find that you're missing me
And your heart starts to wonder where on this Earth I could be
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet

So I'm not moving
I'm not moving
I'm not moving
I'm not moving

People talk about the guy who's waiting on a girl, oh
There are no holes in his shoes, but a big hole in his world, mmm
Maybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be moved
And maybe you won't mean to, but you'll see me on the news
And you'll come running to the corner 'cause you know it's just for you

Nobody matters like you"" (Stay up there, stay up there)

Once, one day, my heart screamed
I fell for you and I can't look back
My reasoning is untrustworthy

Rely on your unyielding
Just in case, it won't hurt anymore
But your reasoning can't be trusted

So just close your eyes
Hiding, the moon is bright
It's good to love, 'if not left
When you count to three, I'm hidden
Take me back in time

The sky is visible, you are a dream
Land was given, could not wait
I hope you get an internship and avoid hell

Is it any wonder things get broke?

I'll never take back the things I said
So high above, I feel it coming down

Tell me why this has to end
Oh, no, oh, no""
I can't save us, my Atlantis, we fall
We built this town on shaky ground
I can't save us, my Atlantis, oh, no
We built it up to pull it down

Now all the birds have fled
The hurt just leaves me scared
Losing everything I've ever known
It's all become too much
Maybe I'm not built for love
If I knew that I could reach you, I would go
