Kahani suno, haan zubani suno
Mujhe pyaar hua tha, ikrar hua tha
Kahani suno, haan zubani suno
Mujhe pyaar hua tha, ikrar hua tha
Mujhe pyaar hua tha, ikrar hua tha

Deewana hua, mastana hua
Teri chahat mein kitna fasana hua
Tere aane ki khushbu, tere jaane ka manzar
Tujhe milna padega, ab zamana hua

Sadaiyein suno, haan jafain suno

Mujhe pyaar hua tha, ikrar hua tha
Mujhe pyaar hua tha, ikrar hua tha

Hai tamanna humein tumhein dulhan banayein
Tere hathon pe mehendi apne naam ki sajayein
Teri lele balayein, tere sadqe taare
Hai tamanna humein tumhein apna banaye

Mujhe pyaar hua tha, ikrar hua tha

Das putt tera head down kaston?
Changa bhala hasda si maun kaston?
Ah jehre darwaje vich board chakki kharhe aa
Mai changi tarah janda ea kaun kaston
Kuch ethe chandi chamkauna chahunde ne
Kuch tainu farh thalle launa chahunde ne
Kujh ke ne aye ethe bhukhe fame de
Naam laike tera agge auna chahunde ne
Museebat tan marda'an te pendi rehndi ae
Dabi'n naa tu duniya swaad lendi ae
Naale jehre raste te tu tureya
Ethe badnami high rate milugi

Nitt controversy create milugi

Jeh karenga tarakki putt hate milugi

Dharma de naam te debate milugi
Sach bolenga ta milu 295
Jeh karenga tarakki putt hate milugi

Ajj kayi bachaun sabheyachaar jutt ke
Janna khana dinda ae vichar uthke
Inj lagge rabb jiven hath kharhe kargeya
Parhan jaddo subah akhbar uthke
Chup reh oh puttra ni bhed kholide
Leader ne ethe haqdar goli de
Jihna de jawaaka de na John te Steve aa
Raakhe bane firde o maa boli de
Jhooth naiyo etho de fact eh vi ne
Chor bande urro de samaj sevi ne
Sach wala baana pa jo lok lutt de
Saja ehna nu vi chheti mate milugi

(Refix got the beat, boy!)
Toota tera poora parivar kyun
Kyunki wahan pyaar nahi bacha
Self-made sab khud ke dam pe
Inhe lagta ke humein karobar nahi pata
Kalam se main car leke aaya
Meri jeet dekh tere liye haar leke aaya
Suna bohot gam teri life mein
To is baar tere liye bar leke aaya

Jaata tha main vistara pe
Ye khajur aaya saamne se Iftar pe
Tune khud pehle G-Pay kiya
To phir repay kiya tera udhaar main
Tujhe lage meri aukaat nahi
Main bahar tеri aukaat se
Suna maine teri tеam nahi saath mein
To gaali kaise khayega tu mil-baant ke
Ye Kendrick Lamar nahi Kendrick beemar hai
Paintis hain deals aur Chaalis pagaar hai
Chauntis ke uncle ko diye sudhaar hai
Chhatis tu lega to bateesi bahar hai
Main aaya tha scene mein peace failane
Dekha jab Bantai ke peeche ye saare
Kutta nahi kutte ke naam pe kalank hai
Kutta bhi tujhse zyada wafadaar hai

Mùa đông trên thung lũng xa như một tiếng kinh cầu
Làm sao để ta quên đi một cơn bão lớn
Em hỡi nếu mộng đẹp có thế thôi
Xin hãy giữ lại phút giây sau cùng
Tình yêu rồi đây sẽ như cơn mộng dở dang

Đời anh tựa như khúc ca ru một sớm mai hồng
Làm sao để cho bờ mi đừng hoen nước mắt
Ai nhớ đến một hạnh phúc lứa đôi
Xin hãy giữ trọn cánh chim phương trời
Người ơi, đừng nên dối gian cho lòng nát tan

Đường mây giờ đây xa vắng dấu chân địa đàng
Vườn hoang tìm đâu cho thấy giấc mơ nồng cháy
Cuộc sống mới rồi người có thấy vui?
Xin hãy giữ lại một chiếc lá rơi
Thời gian giờ đây sẽ như con thuyền lướt trôi


Đời anh tựa như khúc ca
Ru một sớm mai hồng
Làm sao để cho bờ mi đừng hoen nước mắt
Ai nhớ đến một hạnh phúc lứa đôi

Winter in the valley far away like a prayer
How do we forget a big storm
Baby, if dreams are so beautiful
Please save it for the last minute
This love will be like an unfinished dream

My life is like a lullaby one morning pink
How to keep your eyelids from crying
Who remembers a happy couple
Please keep all the birds of the sky
Oh man, don't lie to your broken heart

The road of clouds is now far away from the footprints of paradise
Where can I find a wild garden that shows a burning dream
New life, are you happy?
Please keep a fallen leaf
Time will now be like a sailing boat

Mujhko itna bataye koi
Kaise tujhse dil na lagaye koi

Rabba ne tujhko banane mein
Kardi hai husn ki khaali tijoriyan
Kajal ki siyahi se likhi
Hai tune jaane
Kitno ki love storiyan

Kesariya tera ishq hai piya
Rang jaaun jo main hath lagaun
Din beete saara teri fikr mein
Rain saari teri khair manaun
Kesariya tera ishq hai piya
Rang jaaun jo main hath lagaun
Din beete saara teri fikr mein
Rain saari teri khair manaun

Patjhad ke mausam mein bhi
Rangi chanaron jaisi
Jhanke sannnaton mein tu

Where do you go?
How do you get the heart?

God ne tujhko banane mein
Kardi hai husn ki khaali tijoriyan
Write with ink of kajal

How many love stories

Rang jaaun jo main hath lagaun
Your thoughts are in my mind
Rain saari teri khair manaun
Kesariya Tera Ishq Hai Piya
Rang jaaun jo main hath lagaun
Your thoughts are in my mind
Rain saari teri khair manaun

In the season of Patjhad too

Na dastakein
Yeh tere dil ki haan wahi dhadkane hai
Yoon zor se jo tujhko ab sun rahin hai
Sun le zara yeh tujhse kya keh rahin hai
Aye nahi, jinke the waadein
Waqt uljha hua hai tere yahan pe
Kya woh kal the yahan?
Yaan hafton pehlay ki yeh hai dastaan?

Aye na teri yaad unko
Aye na teri yaad unko

Tootay makaan
Ik baar gir kar waise bante kahan hai?
Jaise the tune apne dil se banaye
O karigar yoon hathon se the sajaaye

Aye na teri yaad unko
Aye na teri yaad unko

Kitabon ke ghar
Duniya hai teri
In dhool bharay panno mein
Tu kya dhoondti?
Aur kya ho gaya jo tujhe
Is dafa na milli pyaari si
Pariyon ki woh kahani?
Aur tum yoon parayshaan ho kyun?
Hai jaadugari aaj bhi
Tere dil mein hai baki
Aur in kagazon mein kahin
Ek GUL hai jo aise tera intezaar kar raha hai
Yeh gul hai teri woh hassi
Kahan kho gai?
Yeh bata, khilegi kabhi?

But you and I are lost in thought here
Take me back with you, life will tell you your umbilical cord
If there is any situation, ask
You are my love

My breath stopped
Habibi, don't you miss me?
I don't feel like it, I'm craving your body
I will present whatever you want
Take my life, take two worlds

Take the name morning and evening, where I am alone

Take the name morning and evening, where I am alone

Alone with no one around

Will also find a solution
I am heartbroken today
Don't listen to me, what are you doing?

You didn't find me, there is sorrow
Why did you give pain to us?
Hum aaj talaq na samjhe
Bure hain kya itne
Tum aa na sake jo milne
Tu Humko Bhool Gaya
Bas yaar hum hi pagal thhe
Thought of you that night…
Jo tu na mila mujhe
Jo tu na mila mujhe
Dil ko kya bataunga
I love you (x2)
Jo tu jo tu na mila mujhe
Dil ko kya bataunga

It’s your boy
Yeah yeah

Tujh mein darr hai I can sense It
Left you bloody jaise menses
Fuck around till you come to your senses
Mein future aur tu past, tenses
Lajawab, you do not have the answers
Tum jaise Afghanistan mein Americans
Aik call pe daaku maarega daaka
Rub a lamp, Kya hukam hai mere aaqa?
Gangland chotay mera shehar proper
Idhar din daharey ho jata hai chaaka
Wo hath Kaatay phir bhi hum khila rahay
Doodh aasteen ke saanp ko pila rahay
Who the fuck told you I was offended?
Mein to chill aur ye beats pе chil'la rahay
Fuckin' visionary beta mujhey visions arahay
Meri koshish yе ke koi bhi larka peechey na rahay
You a pussy tere khwabon mein chicharay arahay
Mene millions maray tou ye mujhay mun charha rahay
Inkay mun mein de do niwala koi bhooka na rahay
Gala kisi pyasay pussy ass ka sookha na rahay
Kisi airay gairay ko koi ghalat fehmi na rahay
Ye wo character hein jo kahani mein hi na rahay
I.T.U.S, Iski topi uske sarr pehna rahay
Hum gehrayi hein aur ye mehez sirf kinaaray
Hum garaai’n hain beta koi 10 saal se
Mene likhay sirf real life haadsay

Lekin aaj kal off rehta mood bhi
Rap Game ka Atif, Late pohanchay shoot pe
Launday sunain mere gaanay

Hyenas hain ye saray ayein ge na, Jhund mein
Mein larhun apne aap se
Call that a Win-Win

Career kay din gin
Make an AK rain on you, Lokhandwala rim jhim

Baarish ho rahi bahir or main kamre mein akela
Andhera bada zaalim mujhe sone nahi dera
Do ghante se likhne ki main koshish hi kar raha hun
Apne ghar ke andar ghar bana ke betha hu main mera
Laazim nahi hai mujh pe ke main sunun sab ki baatein
Par main sun leta hu kyun ke thoda naram dil jo thera
Jaana teri yaadein mujhe sone hi nahi deti
Lete-lete is bistar pe kab ho jaata hai sawera

Mujhe nahi pata hai mujh se mat poocho na
Apne khwaab poore karne ke liye sab kho dunga
Pehle hi sab kho chuka hun, ab kya khaak kho dunga?
Akelеpan mein lagta hai phir se poori raat ro dunga
Main teri yaad mеin asliyat se bhaag ke
Jaunga kahan mein mujhe bas bata de aaj ye
Zindagi tamasha jo kamata wo udaata
Chand bachata kyun ke idhar kaafi pesh hote haadse

Aleem kidhar gayab ho gaye ho?
Na khud se karte message na reply dete ho
Socially inactive, interactive nahi ho zara
Aise nahi the pehle jaana kya se kya hogaye ho
Ayee
Kidhar gayab ho gaye ho?
Dekhte dekhte duniya ki tum vibe hogaye ho
Easily do gaali de kar aa sakte tum aage
Par tum aana nahi chahte bade nice hogaye ho

Ek waqt tha kaafile mein ladkay aath-aath the
Ab aath minus chaar maine chaar kar diya

Aur ye message kar ke kehte hai Aleemrk tu star hai

Roz ye andhera mujhe deta hai andesha
Jo tu dooba in gehraiyon me to aadat chuti phone ki

Pehle din se fear mujhe girne ka raha nahi

Rawani to dekho na
Kitni bemisaal hai

Ghari jo meri ayi hai

Hustle meri apni jaari hai
Sau batein bolo
Main sunnay ko tayaar nai
Apni marzi ka malik
Nai karta koi fire ray (peechay hutt)

Par hum kyun abhi stuck like a jam on a one way
But someday tu samajh jaaegi duur hokey hamm se ke

I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Heat waves been fakin' me out

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out

Loyalty is here
In vain
Gentlemen
What was once
That illusion
No more nobility
This tradition has not survived
Be someone's value
No such habit left
There is no such thing as a misunderstanding that has been created
I have not lost my identity, I have chosen the path of realization
My eyes are longing
Your paths are firm
Hear my sighs
How can I tell you this?
My eyes do not sleep
My nights are not cut
That of dreams of desires
Rains of punishments
Where has the sunshine of my share of rewards gone?
Why painful drains?
Please answer the questions
Why are you oppressing your loved ones?

Dil ke kisi
Konhe mein hi
Yaadein teri, maine
Chupa rakhi hai
Chupa rakhi hai
Bhoola nahi
Tu bhi mujhe
Baatein yun hi, maine
Bana rakhi hai
Bana rakhi hai

Samaya tha dil mein woh aisey
Anjaane doh miltay phir kaisey
Tum baarish mein bheege hum behtay
Samandar kinarey jo rehtay
Umeedain laga ke woh bethay
Jo apne ki gham woh bhi sehtay
Yeh duniya toh chahti ke behkain
Yeh baarish yeh khushboo se mehkain

Mile dard bohot
Kabhi tu bhi mil
Dil mein rehti nai
Jaan ab tu hi dil
Aaj phir aayi na tu
Intezaar raha mustaqil
Taveel hai gham ki sham
Kahani mohabbat ki mukhtasir
Nazarsani karo zara si
Qadar karo meri qala ki
Jaanay wale chalay jaate hain
Kismat yehi to qabu main nahi ati
Chaoon mein dhoop ki tarah
Jism main rooh ki tarah
Guzray dimagh se yaad teri
Lagatar lahu ki tarah
Ab khaye jaayein yеh dar-o-dewaar
Mujhe kisi bhook ki tarah
Teray bina nahi ghar bhi ghar
Akailay mеhsoos yeh kiya
Teri kami puri huyi na
Aaj bhi rahi aik dil mein khala
Khiza bhi aayi par
Waqt aur zulm ka baagh bhi
Raha na hara
Tera hi aitbaar baki saari
Duniya pe bharosa nahi bana
Tu muj main dekhay insaan
Baaki saari duniya ko dikhe bas qalaa
Tu hai!
Main hu!
Aur gehri khamoshi
Hum dono hi nahi suntay
Joh kuch bhi yeh kehti hogi
Gali yeh dil ki tang
Ab tera us main aana na ho
Dil ke mohalle mein
Ab teray mera jana na ho
Tu hai!
Main hoon!
Aur sirf fasle hain
Raapte munqata aur
Muntizir hum aapke hain
Raaz hee nahi raazdaar bhi
Kiya maangte hum
Khamiyo pe parde log
Kamhi yahan daaltay hain
Hum sihanay rakh ke khwaab
Raatein jaagte hain
Hum tumhain tum se bohot behtar jaantay hain

I was gonna rip his heart out
I'm the best ever
I'm the most brutal and vicious and most ruthless champion there's ever been, there's no one can stop me
Lennox is a conqueror? No, I'm Alexander—he's no Alexander
I'm the best ever
There's never been anybody as ruthless
I'm Sonny Liston, I'm Jack Dempsey, there's no one like—I'm from their cloth
There's no one that can match me
My style is﻿ impetuous, my defense is impregnable...

If you're trying to level up, I'm the one that you call
I just do this for the love, I don't do this for the bag
They said meet me at the top, I looked around like where y'all at
Pardon if I laugh, fuck you if you mad
I could lose everything, it's still double what you had
It's like they're watching all my moves and they're copying my style
They say they really ain't but I know they in denial

I was gonna rip his heart out
I'm the best ever
I'm the most brutal and vicious and most ruthless champion there's ever been, there's no one can stop me
Lennox is a conqueror? No, I'm Alexander—he's no Alexander
I'm the best ever
There's never been anybody as ruthless
I'm Sonny Liston, I'm Jack Dempsey, there's no one like—I'm from their cloth
There's no one that can match me
My style is﻿ impetuous, my defense is impregnable...

Oh broke as fuck ne haan diye

They said meet me at the top, I looked around like where y'all at
Pardon if I laugh, fuck you if you mad
I could lose everything, it's still double what you had
It's like they're watching all my moves and they're copying my style

53,53,53,Atif Aslam,Moonrise,"1 ContributorArabian Nights, Vol. 9 (Chap. 10) LyricsKamar Al-Zaman and the Jeweller's Wife

There was once, in time of old, a merchant hight Abd al-Rahmán, whom Allah had blessed with a son and daughter, and for their much beauty and loveliness, he named the girl Kaubab al-Sabáh and the boy Kamar al-Zamán. When he saw what Allah had vouchsafed the twain of beauty and loveliness, brilliancy and symmetry, he feared for them the evil eyes of the espiers and the jibing tongues of the jealous and the craft of the crafty and the wiles of the wicked and shut them up from the folk in a mansion for the space of fourteen years, during which time none saw them save their parents and a slave-girl who served them. Now their father could recite the Koran, even as Allah sent it down, as also did his wife, wherefore the mother taught her daughter to read and recite it and the father his son till both had gotten it by heart. Moreover, the twain learned from their parents writing and reckoning and all manner of knowledge and polite letters and needed no master. When Kamar al-Zaman came to years of manhood, the wife said to her husband, ""How long wilt thou keep thy son Kamar al-Zaman sequestered from the eyes of the folk? Is he a girl or a boy?"" He answered, ""A boy."" Rejoined she, ""An he be a boy, why dost thou not carry him to the bazar and seat him in thy shop, that he may know the folk and they know him, to the intent that it may become notorious among men that he is thy son, and do thou teach him to sell and to buy. Peradventure somewhat may befal thee; so shall the folk know him for thy son and he shall lay his hand on thy leavings. But, an thou die, as the case now is, and he say to the folk, 'I am the son of the merchant Abd al-Rahman,' verily they will not believe him, but will cry, 'We have never seen thee and we knew not that he had a son,' wherefore the government will seize thy goods and thy son will be despoiled. In like manner the girl; I mean to make her known among the folk, so may be some one of her own condition may ask her in marriage and we will wed her to him and rejoice in her."" Quoth he, ""I did thus of my fear for them from the eyes of the folk,""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Nine Hundred and Sixty-fourth Night,
She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Merchant's wife spake to him in such wise, he replied, ""I did thus of my fear for them from the eyes of the folk and because I love them both and love is jealous exceedingly and well saith he who spoke these verses,
'Of my sight I am jealous for thee, of me, * Of thyself, of thy
            stead, of thy destiny:
Though I shrined thee in eyes by the craze of me * In such
             nearness irk I should never see:
Though thou wert by my side all the days of me * Till Doomsday I
             ne'er had enough of thee.'""
Said his wife, ""Put thy trust in Allah, for no harm betideth him whom He protecteth, and carry him with thee this very day to the shop."" Then she clad the boy in the costliest clothes and he became a seduction to all who on him cast sight and an affliction to the heart of each lover wight. His father took him and carried him to the market, whilst all who saw him were ravished with him and accosted him, kissing his hand and saluting him with the salam. Quoth one, ""Indeed the sun hath risen in such a place and blazeth in the bazar,"" and another, ""The rising-place of the full moon is in such a quarter;"" and a third, ""The new moon of the Festival hath appeared to the creatures of Allah."" And they went on to allude to the boy in talk and call down blessings upon him. But his father scolded the folk for following his son to gaze upon him, because he was abashed at their talk, but he could not hinder one of them from talking; so he fell to abusing the boy's mother and cursing her because she had been the cause of his bringing him out. And as he gazed about he still saw the folk crowding upon him behind and before. Then he walked on till he reached his shop and opening it, sat down and seated his son before him: after which he again looked out and found the thoroughfare blocked with people for all the passers-by, going and coming, stopped before the shop to stare at that beautiful face and could not leave him; and all the men and women crowded in knots about him, applying to themselves the words of him who said,
""Thou madest Beauty to spoil man's sprite * And saidst, 'O my
           servants, fear My reprove:'
But lovely Thou lovest all loveliness * How, then, shall thy
            servants refrain from Love?""
When the merchant Abd al-Rahman saw the folk thus crowding about him and standing in rows, both women and men, to fix eyes upon his son, he was sore ashamed and confounded and knew not what to do; but presently there came up from the end of the bazar a man of the wandering Dervishes, clad in haircloth, the garb of the pious servants of Allah and seeing Kamar al-Zaman sitting there as he were a branch of Bán springing from a mound of saffron, poured forth copious tears and recited these two couplets,
""A wand uprising from a sandy knoll, * Like full moon shining
            brightest sheen, I saw;
And said, 'What is thy name?' Replied he 'Lúlú' * 'What' (asked
            I) 'Lily?' and he answered 'Lá, lá!'""
Then the Dervish fell to walking, now drawing near and now moving away, and wiping his gray hairs with his right hand, whilst the heart of the crowd was cloven asunder for awe of him. When he looked upon the boy, his eyes were dazzled and his wit confounded, and exemplified in him was the saying of the poet,
""While that fair-faced boy abode in the place, * Moon of
             breakfast-fête he lit by his face,
Lo! there came a Shaykh with leisurely pace * A reverend trusting
             to Allah's grace,
                          And ascetic signals his gait display'd.
He had studied Love both by day and night * And had special
             knowledge of Wrong and Right;
Both for lad and lass had repined his sprite, * And his form like
            toothpick was lean and slight,
                          And old bones with faded skin were o'erlaid.
In such arts our Shaykh was an Ajamí * With a catamite
             ever in company;
In the love of woman, a Platonist he * But in either
            versed to the full degree,
                         And Zaynab to him was the same as Zayd.
Distraught by the Fair he adored the Fair * O'er Spring-camp
           wailed, bewept ruins bare.
Dry branch thou hadst deemed him for stress o' care, * Which the
            morning breeze swayeth here and there,
                         For only the stone is all hardness made!
In the lore of Love he was wondrous wise * And wide awake with
            all-seeing eyes.
Its rough and its smooth he had tried and tries * And hugged buck
            and doe in the self-same guise
                          And with greybeard and beardless alike he
play'd.""
Then he came up to the boy and gave him a root of sweet basil, whereupon his father put forth his hand to his pouch and brought out for him some small matter of silver, saying, ""Take thy portion, O Dervish, and wend thy ways."" He took the dirhams, but sat down on the masonry-bench alongside the shop and opposite the boy and fell to gazing upon him and heaving sigh upon sigh, whilst his tears flowed like springs founting. The folk began to look at him and remark upon him, some saying, ""All Dervishes are lewd fellows,"" and other some, ""Verily, this Dervish's heart is set on fire for love of this lad."" Now when Abd al-Rahman saw this case, he arose and said to the boy, ""Come, O my son, let us lock up the shop and hie us home, for it booteth not to sell and buy this day; and may Almighty Allah requite thy mother that which she hath done with us, for she was the cause of all this!"" Then said he, ""O Dervish, rise, that I may shut my shop."" So the Dervish rose and the merchant shut his shop and taking his son, walked away. The Dervish and the folk followed them, till they reached their place, when the boy went in and his father, turning to the Dervish, said to him, ""What wouldst thou, O Dervish, and why do I see thee weep?"" He replied, ""O my lord, I would fain be thy guest this night, for the guest is the guest of Almighty Allah."" Quoth the merchant, ""Welcome to the guest of God: enter, O Dervish!""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Nine Hundred and Sixty-fifth Night,
She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the merchant, the father of Kamar al-Zaman, heard the saying of the Dervish, ""I am Allah's guest,"" he replied, ""Welcome to the guest of God: enter, O Dervish!"" But he said to himself, ""An the beggar be enamoured of the boy and sue him for sin, needs must I slay him this very night and bury him secretly. But, an there be no lewdness in him, the guest shall eat his portion."" Then he brought him into a saloon, where he left him with Kamar al-Zaman, after he had said privily to the lad, ""O my son, sit thou beside the Dervish when I am gone out and sport with him and provoke him to love-liesse and if he seek of thee lewdness, I who will be watching you from the window overlooking the saloon will come down to him and kill him."" So, as soon as Kamar al-Zaman was alone in the room with the Dervish, he sat down by his side and the old man began to look upon him and sigh and weep. Whenever the lad bespake him, he answered him kindly, trembling the while and would turn to him groaning and crying, and thus he did till supper was brought in, when he fell to eating, with his eyes on the boy but refrained not from shedding tears. When a fourth part of the night was past and talk was ended and sleep-tide came, Abd al-Rahman said to the lad, ""O my son, apply thyself to the service of thine uncle the Dervish and gainsay him not:"" and would have gone out; but the Dervish cried to him, ""O my lord, carry thy son with thee or sleep with us."" Answered the merchant, ""Nay, my son shall lie with thee: haply thy soul may desire somewhat, and he will look to thy want and wait upon thee."" Then he went out leaving them both together, and sat down in an adjoining room which had a window giving upon the saloon. Such was the case with the merchant; but as to the lad, as soon as his sire had left them, he came up to the Dervish and began to provoke him and offer himself to him, whereupon he waxed wroth and said, ""What talk is this, O my son? I take refuge with Allah from Satan the Stoned! O my Lord, indeed this is a denial of Thee which pleaseth Thee not! Avaunt from me, O my son!"" So saying, the Dervish arose and sat down at a distance; but the boy followed him and threw himself upon him, saying, ""Why, O Dervish, wilt thou deny thyself the joys of my possession, and I with a heart that loveth thee?"" Hereupon the Dervish's anger redoubled and he said, ""An thou refrain not from me, I will summon thy sire and tell him of thy doings."" Quoth the lad, ""My father knoweth my turn for this and it may not be that he will hinder me: so heal thou my heart. Why dost thou hold off from me? Do I not please thee?"" Answered the Dervish, ""By Allah, O my son, I will not do this, though I be hewn in pieces with sharp-edged swords!""; and he repeated the saying of the poet,
""Indeed my heart loves all the lovely boys * As girls; nor am I
             slow to such delight,
But, though I sight them every night and morn, * I'm neither of
            Lot's folk nor wencher-wight.""
Then he shed tears and said, ""Arise, open the door, that I may wend my way, for I will lie no longer in this lodging."" Therewith he rose to his feet; but the boy caught hold of him, saying, ""Look at the fairness of my face and the cramoisy of my cheeks and the softness of my sides and the lusciousness of my lips."" Moreover he discovered to him calves that would shame wine and cupcarrier and gazed on him with fixed glance that would baffle enchanter and enchantments; for he was passing of loveliness and full of blandishment, even as saith of him one of the poets who sang,
""I can't forget him, since he rose and showed with fair design *
          Those calves of legs whose pearly shine make light in
            nightly gloom:
Wonder not an my flesh uprise as though 'twere Judgment-day *
             When every shank shall bared be and that is Day of
             Doom.""
Then the boy displayed to him his bosom, saying, ""Look at my breasts which be goodlier than the breasts of maidens and my lip-dews are sweeter than sugar-candy. So quit scruple and asceticism and cast off devoutness and abstinence and take thy fill of my possession and enjoy my loveliness. Fear naught, for thou art safe from hurt, and leave this hebetude for 'tis a bad habit."" And he went on to discover to him his hidden beauties, striving to turn the reins of his reason with his bendings in graceful guise, whilst the Dervish turned away his face and said, ""I seek refuge with Allah! Have some shame, O my son! This is a forbidden thing I deem and I will not do it, no, not even in dream."" The boy pressed upon him, but the Dervish got free from him and turning towards Meccah addressed himself to his devotions. Now when the boy saw him praying, he left him till he had prayed a two-bow prayer and saluted, when he would have accosted him again; but the Dervish again repeated the intent and prayed a second two-bow prayer, and thus he did a third and a fourth and a fifth time. Quoth the lad, ""What prayers are these? Art thou minded to take flight upon the clouds? Thou lettest slip our delight, whilst thou passest the whole night in the prayer-niche."" So saying, he threw himself upon the Dervish and kissed him between the eyes; but the Shaykh said, ""O my son, put Satan away from thine estate and take upon thee obedience of the Compassionate."" Quoth the other, ""An thou do not with me that which I desire, I will call my sire and say to him, The Dervish is minded to do lewdness with me. Whereupon he will come in to thee and beat thee till thy bones be broken upon thy flesh."" All this while Abd al-Rahman was watching with his eyes and hearkening with his ears, and he was certified that there was no frowardness in the Dervish and he said to himself, ""Were he a lewd fellow, he had not stood out against all this importunity."" The boy continued to beguile the Dervish and every time he expressed purpose of prayer, he interrupted him, till at last he waxed wroth with passing wrath and was rough with him and beat him. Kamar al-Zaman wept and his father came in and having wiped away his tears and comforted him said to the Dervish, ""O my brother, since thou art in such case, why didst thou weep and sigh when thou sawest my son? Say me, is there a reason for this?"" He replied, ""There is;"" and Abd al-Rahman pursued, ""When I saw thee weep at his sight, I deemed evil of thee and bade the boy do with thee thus, that I might try thee, purposing in myself, if I saw thee sue him for sin, to come in upon thee and kill thee. But, when I saw what thou didst, I knew thee for one of those who are virtuous to the end. Now Allah upon thee, tell me the cause of thy weeping!"" The Dervish sighed and said, ""O my lord, chafe not a closed wound."" But the merchant said, ""There is no help but thou tell me;"" and the other began, ""Know thou that I am a Dervish who wander in the lands and the countries, and take warning by the display of the Creator of Night and Day. It chanced that one Friday I entered the city of Bassorah in the undurn.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Nine Hundred and Sixty-sixth Night,
She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Dervish said to the merchant, ""Know, then, that I a wandering mendicant chanced one Friday to enter the city of Bassorah in the undurn and saw the shops open and full of all manner of wares and meat and drink; but the place was deserted and therein was neither man nor woman nor girl nor boy: nor in the markets and the main streets was there dog or cat nor sounded sound nor friend was found. I marvelled at this end and said to myself, 'I wonder whither the people of the city be gone with their cats and dogs and what hath Allah done with them?' Now I was anhungred so I took hot bread from a baker's oven and going into the shop of an oilman, spread the bread with clarified butter and honey and ate. Then I entered the shop of a sherbet-seller and drank what I would; after which, seeing a coffee-shop open, I went in and found the pots on the fire, full of coffee; but there was no one there. So I drank my fill and said, 'Verily, this is a wondrous thing! It seemeth as though Death had stricken the people of this city and they had all died this very hour, or as if they had taken fright at something which befel them and fled, without having time to shut their shops.' Now whilst pondering this matter, lo! I heard a sound of a band of drums beating; whereat I was afraid and hid myself for a while: then, looking out through a crevice, I saw damsels, like moons, come walking through the market, two by two, with uncovered heads and faces displayed. They were in forty pairs, thus numbering fourscore and in their midst a young lady, riding on a horse that could hardly move his legs for that which was upon it of silvern trappings and golden and jewelled housings. Her face was wholly unveiled, and she was adorned with the costliest ornaments and clad in the richest of raiment and about her neck she wore a collar of gems and on her bosom were necklaces of gold; her wrists were clasped with bracelets which sparkled like stars, and her ankles with bangles of gold set with precious stones. The slave-girls walked before her and behind and on her right and left and in front of her was a damsel bearing in baldric a great sword, with grip of emerald and tassels of jewel-encrusted gold. When that young lady came to where I lay hid, she pulled up her horse and said, 'O damsels, I hear a noise of somewhat within yonder shop: so do ye search it, lest haply there be one hidden there, with intent to enjoy a look at us, whilst we have our faces unveiled.' So they searched the shop opposite the coffee-house wherein I lay hid, whilst I abode in terror; and presently I saw them come forth with a man and they said to her, 'O our lady, we found a man there and here he is before thee.' Quoth she to the damsel with the sword, 'Smite his neck.' So she went up to him and struck off his head; then, leaving the dead man lying on the ground, they passed on. When I saw this, I was affrighted; but my heart was taken with love of the young lady. After an hour or so, the people reappeared and every one who had a shop entered it; whilst the folk began to come and go about the bazars and gathered around the slain man, staring at him as a curiosity. Then I crept forth from my hiding place by stealth, and none took note of me, but love of that lady had gotten possession of my heart, and I began to enquire of her privily. None, however, gave me news of her; so I left Bassorah, with vitals yearning for her love; and when I came upon this thy son, I saw him to be the likest of all creatures to the young lady; wherefore he reminded me of her and his sight revived the fire of passion in me and kindled anew in my heart the flames of love-longing and distraction. And such is the cause of my shedding tears!"" Then he wept with sore weeping till he could no more and said, ""O my lord, I conjure thee by Allah, open the door to me, so I may gang my gait!"" Accordingly Abd al-Rahman opened the door and he went forth. Thus fared it with him; but as regards Kamar al-Zaman, when he heard the Dervish's story, his heart was taken with love of the lady and passion gat the mastery of him and raged in him longing and distraction; so, on the morrow, he said to his sire, ""All the sons of the merchants wander about the world to attain their desire, nor is there one of them but his father provideth for him a stock-in-trade wherewithal he may travel and traffic for gain. Why, then, O my father, dost thou not outfit me with merchandise, so I may fare with it and find my luck?"" He replied, ""O my son, such merchants lack money; so they send their sons to foreign parts for the sake of profit and pecuniary gain and provision of the goods of the world. But I have monies in plenty nor do I covet more: why then should I exile thee? Indeed, I cannot brook to be parted from thee an hour, more especially as thou art unique in beauty and loveliness and perfect grace and I fear for thee."" But Kamar al-Zaman said, ""O my father, nothing will serve but thou must furnish me with merchandise wherewithal to travel; else will I fly from thee at unawares though without money or merchandise. So, an thou wish to solace my heart, make ready for me a stock-in-trade, that I may travel and amuse myself by viewing the countries of men."" Abd al-Rahman, seeing his son enamoured of travel, acquainted his wife with this, saying, ""Verily thy son would have me provide him with goods, so he may fare therewith to far regions, albeit Travel is Travail."" Quoth she, ""What is there to displease thee in this? Such is the wont of the sons of the merchants and they all vie one with other in glorifying globe-trotting and gain."" Quoth he, ""Most of the merchants are poor and seek growth of good; but I have wealth galore."" She replied, ""More of a good thing hurteth not; and, if thou comply not with his wish, I will furnish him with goods of my own monies."" Quoth Abd al-Rahman, ""I fear strangerhood for him, inasmuch as travel is the worst of trouble;"" but she said, ""There is no harm in strangerhood for him when it leadeth to gaining good; and, if we consent not, our son will go away and we shall seek him and not find him and be dishonoured among the folk."" The merchant accepted his wife's counsel and provided his son with merchandise to the value of ninety thousand gold pieces, whilst his mother gave him a purse containing forty bezel-stones, jewels of price, the least of the value of one of which was five hundred ducats, saying, ""O my son, be careful of this jewellery for 'twill be of service to thee."" Thereupon Kamar al-Zaman took the jewels and set out for Bassorah,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Nine Hundred and Sixty-seventh Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al-Zaman took the jewels and set out for Bassorah after he had laid them in a belt, which he buckled about his waist; and he stayed not till there remained aught but a day's journey between that city and himself; when the Arabs came out upon him and stripped him naked and slew his men and servants; but he laid himself down among the slain and wallowed in their blood, so that the wildlings took him for dead and left him without even turning him over and made off with their booty. When the Arabs had gone their ways, Kamar al-Zaman arose, having naught left but the jewels in his girdle, and fared on nor ceased faring till he came to Bassorah. It chanced that his entry was on a Friday and the town was void of folk, even as the Dervish had informed him. He found the market-streets deserted and the shops wide open and full of goods; so he ate and drank and looked about him. Presently, he heard a band of drums beating and hid himself in a shop, till the slave-girls came up, when he looked at them; and, seeing the young lady riding amongst them, love and longing overcame him and desire and distraction overpowered him, so that he had no force to stand. After awhile, the people reappeared and the bazars filled. Whereupon he went to the market and repairing to a jeweller and pulling out one of his forty gems sold it for a thousand dinars, wherewith he returned to his place and passed the night there; and when morning morrowed he changed his clothes and going to the Hamman came forth as he were the full moon. Then he sold other four stones for four thousand dinars and sauntered solacing himself about the main streets of Bassorah, clad in the costliest of clothes; till he came to a market, where he saw a barber's shop. So he went in to the barber who shaved his head; and, clapping up an acquaintance with him, said to him, ""O my father, I am a stranger in these parts and yesterday I entered this city and found it void of folk, nor was there in it any living soul, man nor Jinni. Then I saw a troop of slave-girls and amongst them a young lady riding in state:"" and he went on to tell him all he had seen. Said the barber, ""O my son, hast thou told any but me of this?""; and he said, ""No."" The other rejoined, ""Then, O my son, beware thou mention this before any but me; for all folk cannot keep a secret and thou art but a little lad and I fear lest the talk travel from man to man, till it reach those whom it concerneth and they slay thee. For know, O my son, that this thou hast seen, none ever kenned nor knew in other than this city. As for the people of Bassorah they are dying of this annoy; for every Friday forenoon they shut up the dogs and cats, to hinder them from going about the market-streets, and all the people of the city enter the cathedral-mosques, where they lock the doors on them and not one of them can pass about the bazar nor even look out of casement; nor knoweth any the cause of this calamity. But, O my son, to-night I will question my wife concerning the reason thereof, for she is a midwife and entereth the houses of the notables and knoweth all the city news. So Inshallah, do thou come to me to-morrow and I will tell thee what she shall have told me."" With this Kamar al-Zaman pulled out a handful of gold and said to him, ""O my father, take this gold and give it to thy wife, for she is become my mother."" Then he gave him a second handful, saying, ""Take this for thyself."" Whereupon quoth the barber, ""O my son, sit thou in thy place, till I go to my wife and ask her and bring the news of the true state of the case."" So saying, he left him in the shop and going home, acquainted his wife with the young man's case, saying, ""I would have thee tell me the truth of this city-business, so I may report it to this young merchant, for he hath set his heart on weeting the reason why men and beasts are forbidden the market-streets every Friday forenoon; and methinks he is a lover, for he is openhanded and liberal, and if we tell him what he would trow, we shall get great good of him."" Quoth she, ""Go back and say to him, 'Come, speak with thy mother, my wife, who sendeth her salam to thee and saith to thee, Thy wish is won.'"" Accordingly he returned to the shop, where he found Kamar al-Zaman sitting awaiting him and repeated him the very words spoken by his spouse. Then he carried him in to her and she welcomed him and bade him sit down; whereupon he pulled out an hundred ducats and gave them to her, saying, ""O my mother, tell me who this young lady may be."" Said she, ""Know, O my son, that there came a gem to the Sultan of Bassorah from the King of Hind, and he was minded to have it pierced. So he summoned all the jewellers in a body and said to them, 'I wish you to drill me this jewel. Whoso pierceth it, I will give him whatsoever he shall ask; but if he break it, I will cut off his head.' At this they were afraid and said, 'O King of the age, a jewel is soon spoilt and there are few who can pierce them without injury, for most of them have a flaw. So do not thou impose upon us a task to which we are unable; for our hands cannot avail to drill this jewel. However, our Shaykh is more experienced than we.' Asked the King, 'And who is your Shaykh?'; and they answered, 'Master Obayd: he is more versed than we in this art and hath wealth galore and of skill great store. Therefore do thou send for him to the presence and bid him pierce thee this jewel.' Accordingly the King sent for Obayd and bade him pierce the jewel, imposing on him the condition aforesaid. He took it and pierced it to the liking of the King who said to him, 'Ask a boon of me, O master'; and said he, 'O King of the age, allow me delay till to-morrow.' Now the reason of this was that he wished to take counsel with his wife, who is the young lady thou sawest riding in procession; for he loveth her with exceeding love, and of the greatness of his affection for her, he doth naught without consulting her; wherefore he put off asking till the morrow. When he went home, he said to her, 'I have pierced the King a jewel and he hath granted me a boon which I deferred asking till to-morrow, that I might consult thee. Now what dost thou wish, that I may ask it?' Quoth she, 'We have riches such as fires may not consume; but, an thou love me, ask of the King to make proclamation in the streets of Bassorah that all the townsfolk shall every Friday enter the mosques, two hours before the hour of prayer, so none may abide in the town at all great or small except they be in the mosques or in the houses and the doors be locked upon them, and that every shop of the town be left open. Then will I ride with my slave-women through the heart of the city and none shall look on me from window or lattice; and every one whom I find abroad I will kill.' So he went in to the King and begged of him this boon, which he granted him and caused proclamation to be made amongst the Bassorites,""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When is was the Nine Hundred and Sixty-eighth Night,
She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the barber's wife said, ""When the Jeweller begged his boon, the King bade proclamation be made amongst the Bassorites, but the people objected that they feared for their goods from the cats and dogs; wherefore he commanded to shut the animals up till the folk should come forth from the Friday prayers. So the jeweller's wife fell to sallying forth every Friday, two hours before the time of congregational prayer, and riding in state through the city with her women; during which time none dareth pass through the market-place nor look out of casement or lattice. This, then, is what thou wouldest know and I have told thee who she is; but, O my son, was it thy desire only to have news of her or hast thou a mind to meet her?"" Answered he, ""O my mother, 'tis my wish to foregather with her."" Quoth she, ""Tell me what valuables thou hast with thee""; and quoth he, ""O my mother, I have with me precious stones of four sorts, the first worth five hundred dinars each, the second seven hundred, the third eight hundred and the fourth a thousand ducats."" She asked, ""Art thou willing to spend four of these?""; and he answered, ""I am ready to spend all of them."" She rejoined, ""Then, arise, O my son, and go straight to thy lodging and take a bezel-gem of those worth five hundred sequins, with which do thou repair to the jewel market and ask for the shop of Master Obayd, the Shaykh of the Jewellers. Go thither and thou wilt find him seated in his shop, clad in rich clothes, with workmen under his hand. Salute him and sit down on the front shelf of his shop; then pull out the jewel and give it to him, saying, 'O master, take this stone and fashion it into a seal-ring for me with gold. Make it not large, a Miskál in weight and no more; but let the fashion of it be thy fairest.' Then give him twenty dinars and to each of his prentices a dinar. Sit with him awhile and talk with him and if a beggar approach thee, show thy generosity by giving him a dinar, to the intent that he may affect thee, and after this, leave him and return to thy place. Pass the night there, and next morning, take an hundred dinars and bring them and give them to thy father the barber, for he is poor."" Quoth Kamar al-Zaman, ""Be it so,"" and returning to his caravanserai, took a jewel worth five hundred gold pieces and went with it to the jewel-bazar. There he enquired for the shop of Master Obayd, Shaykh of the Jewellers, and they directed him thereto. So he went thither and saw the Shaykh, a man of austere aspect and robed in sumptuous raiment with four journeymen under his hand. He addressed him with ""Peace be upon you!"" and the jeweller returned his greeting and welcoming him, made him sit down. Then he brought out the jewel and said, ""O master, I wish thee to make me this jewel into a seal-ring with gold. Let it be the weight of a Miskal and no more, but fashion it excellently."" Then he pulled out twenty dinars and gave them to him, saying, ""This is the fee for chasing and the price of the ring shall remain."" And he gave each of the apprentices a gold piece, wherefore they loved him, and so did Master Obayd. Then he sat talking with the jeweller and whenever a beggar came up to him, he gave him a gold piece and they all marvelled at his generosity. Now Master Obayd had tools at home, like those he had in the shop, and whenever he was minded to do any unusual piece of work, it was his custom to carry it home and do it there, that his journeymen might not learn the secrets of his wonderful workmanship. His wife used to sit before him, and when she was sitting thus and he looking upon her, he would fashion all manner of marvellously wroughten trinkets, such as were fit for none but kings. So he went home and sat down to mould the ring with admirable workmanship. When his wife saw him thus engaged, she asked him, ""What wilt thou do with this bezel-gem?""; and he answered, ""I mean to make it into a ring with gold, for 'tis worth five hundred dinars."" She enquired, ""For whom?""; and he answered, ""For a young merchant, who is fair of face, with eyes that wound with desire, and cheeks that strike fire and mouth like the seal of Sulaymán and cheeks like the bloom of Nu'mán and lips red as coralline and neck like the antelope's long and fine. His complexion is white dashed with red and he is well-bred, pleasant and generous and doth thus and thus."" And he went on to describe to her now his beauty and loveliness and then his perfection and bounty and ceased not to vaunt his charms and the generosity of his disposition, till he had made her in love with him; for there is no sillier cuckold than he who vaunteth to his wife another man's handsome looks and unusual liberality in money matters. So, when desire rose high in her, she said to him, ""Is aught of my charms found in him?"" Said he, ""He hath all thy beauties; and he is thy counterpart in qualities. Meseemeth his age is even as thine and but that I fear to hurt thy feelings, I would say that he is a thousand times handsomer than thou art."" She was silent, yet the fire of fondness was kindled in her heart. And the jeweller ceased not to talk with her and to set out Kamar al-Zaman's charms before her till he had made an end of moulding the ring; when he gave it to her and she put it on her finger, which it fitted exactly. Quoth she, ""O my lord, my heart loveth this ring and I long for it to be mine and will not take it from my finger."" Quoth he, ""Have patience! The owner of it is generous, and I will seek to buy it of him, and if he will sell it, I will bring it to thee. Or if he have another such stone, I will buy it and fashion it for thee into a ring like this.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Nine Hundred and Sixty-ninth Night,
She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the jeweller said to his wife, ""Have patience! The owner of it is generous and I will seek to buy it of him; and, if he will sell it, I will bring it to thee; or, if he have another such stone I will buy it and fashion it for thee into a ring like this."" On this wise it fared with the jeweller and his wife; but as regards Kamar al-Zaman, he passed the night in his lodging and on the morrow he took an hundred dinars and carried them to the old woman, the barber's wife, saying to her, ""Accept these gold pieces,"" and she replied, ""Give them to thy father."" So he gave them to the barber and she asked, ""Hast thou done as I bade thee?"" He answered, ""Yes,"" and she said, ""Go now to the Shaykh, the jeweller, and if he give thee the ring, put it on the tip of thy finger and pull it off in haste and say to him, 'O master, thou hast made a mistake; the ring is too tight.' He will say, 'O merchant, shall I break it and mould it again larger?' And do thou say, 'It booteth not to break it and fashion it anew. Take it and give it to one of thy slave-women.' Then pull out another stone worth seven hundred dinars and say to him, 'Take this stone and set it for me, for 'tis handsomer than the other.' Give him thirty dinars and to each of the prentices two, saying, 'These gold pieces are for the chasing and the price of the ring shall remain.' Then return to thy lodging for the night and on the morrow bring me two hundred ducats, and I will complete thee the rest of the device."" So the youth went to the jeweller, who welcomed him and made him sit down in his shop; and he asked him, ""Hast thou done my need?"" ""Yes,"" answered Obayd and brought out to him the seal-ring; whereupon he set it on his finger-tip and pulling it off in haste, cried, ""Thou hast made a mistake, O master;"" and threw it to him, saying, ""'Tis too strait for my finger."" Asked the jeweller, ""O merchant, shall I make it larger?"" But he answered, ""Not so; take it as a gift and give it to one of thy slave-girls. Its worth is trifling, some five hundred dinars; so it booteth not to fashion it over again."" Then he brought out to him another stone worth seven hundred sequins and said to him, ""Set this for me: 'tis a finer gem."" Moreover he gave him thirty dinars and to each of his workmen two. Quoth Obayd, ""O my lord we will take the price of the ring when we have made it."" But Kamar al-Zaman said, ""This is for the chasing, and the price of the ring remains over."" So saying, he went away home, leaving the jeweller and his men amazed at the excess of his generosity. Presently the jeweller returned to his wife and said, ""O Halimah, never did I set eyes on a more generous than this young man, and as for thee, thy luck is good, for he hath given me the ring without price, saying, 'Give it to one of thy slave-women.'"" And he told her what had passed, adding, ""Methinks this youth is none of the sons of the merchants, but that he is of the sons of the Kings and Sultans."" Now the more he praised him, the more she waxed in love-longing, passion and distraction for him. So she took the ring and put it on her finger, whilst the jeweller made another one, a little larger than the first. When he had finished moulding it, she put it on her finger, under the first, and said, ""Look, O my lord, how well the two rings show on my finger! I wish they were both mine."" Said he, ""Patience! It may be I shall buy thee this second one."" Then he lay that night and on the morrow he took the ring and went to his shop. As for Kamar al-Zaman, as soon as it was day, he repaired to the barber's wife and gave her two hundred dinars. Quoth she, ""Go to the jeweller and when he giveth thee the ring, put it on thy finger and pull it off again in haste, saying, 'Thou hast made a mistake, O master! This ring is too large. A master like thee, when the like of me cometh to him with a piece of work, it behoveth him to take right measure; and if thou hadst measured my finger, thou hadst not erred.' Then pull out another stone worth a thousand dinars and say to him, 'Take this and set it, and give this ring to one of thy slave-women.' Give him forty ducats and to each of his journeymen three, saying, ""This is for the chasing, and for the cost of the ring, that shall remain.' And see what he will say. Then bring three hundred diners and give them to thy father the barber that he may mend his fortune withal, for he is a poor man."" Answered Kamar al-Zaman, ""I hear and obey,"" and betook himself to the jeweller, who welcomed him and making him sit down, gave him the ring. He took it and put it on his finger; then pulled it off in haste and said, ""It behoveth a master like thee, when the like of me bringeth him a piece of work, to take his measure. Hadst thou measured my finger, thou hadst not erred but take it and give it to one of thy slave women."" Then he brought out to him a stone worth a thousand sequins and said to him, ""Take this and set it in a signet-ring for me after the measure of my finger."" Quoth Obayd, ""Thou hast spoken sooth and art in the right;"" and took his measure, whereupon he pulled out forty gold pieces and gave them to him, saying, ""Take these for the chasing and the price of the ring shall remain."" Cried the jeweller, ""O my lord, how much hire have we taken of thee' Verily, thy bounty to us is great!"" ""No harm,"" replied Kamar al-Zaman and sat talking with him awhile and giving a diner to every beggar who passed by the shop. Then he left him and went away, whilst the jeweller returned home and said to his wife, 'How generous is this young merchant! Never did I set eyes on a more open handed or a comelier than he, no, nor a sweeter of speech. And he went on to recount to her his charms and generosity and was loud in his praise. Cried she, ""O thou lack tact, since thou notest these qualities in him, and indeed he hath given thee two seal rings of price, it behoveth thee to invite him and make him an entertainment and entreat him lovingly. When he seest that thou affectest him and cometh to our place, we shall surely get great good of him; and if thou grudge him the banquet do thou bid him and I will entertain him of my monies."" Quoth he, ""Dost thou know me to be niggardly, that thou sayest this Say?; and quoth she, ""Thou art no niggard, but thou lackest tact. Invite him this very night and come not without him. An he refuse, conjure him by the divorce oath and be persistent with him ""On my head and eyes,"" answered he and moulded the ring till he had finished it, after which he passed the night and went forth on the morrow to his shop and sat there. On this wise it was with him, but as for Kamar al-Zaman, he took three hundred diners and carrying them to the old wife, gave them to her for the barber, her husband. Said she, ""Most like he will invite thee to his house this day; and if he do this and thou pass the night there, tell me in the morning what befalleth thee and bring with thee four hundred diners and give them to thy father."" Answered he, ""Hearing and obeying;"" and as often as he ran out of money, he would sell some of his stones. So he repaired to the jeweller, who rose to him and received him with open arms, greeted him heartily and clapped up companionship with him. Then he gave him the ring, and he found it after the measure of his finger and said to the jeweller, ""Allah bless thee, O prince of artists! The setting is conformable but the stone is not to my liking."" And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say,
When it was the Nine Hundred and Seventieth Night,
She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al-Zaman said to the jeweller, ""The setting is conformable to my wishes, but the stone is not to my liking. I have a handsomer than this: so take the seal-ring and give it to one of thy slave women."" Then he gave him a fourth stone and an hundred diners, saying, ""Take thy hire and excuse the trouble we have given thee."" Obayd replied, ""O merchant, all the trouble thou hast given us thou hast requited us and hast over whelmed us with thy great bounties: and indeed my heart is taken with love of thee and I cannot brook parting from thee. So, Allah upon thee, be thou my guest this night and heal my heart."" He rejoined, ""So be it; but needs must I go to my Khan, that I may give a charge to my domestics and tell them that I shall sleep abroad to night, so they may not expect me."" ""Where dost thou lodge?"" asked the jeweller; and he answered, ""In such a Khan."" Quoth Obayd, ""I will come for thee there;"" and quoth the other ""'Tis well."" So the jeweller repaired to the Khan before sundown, fearing lest his wife should be anangered with him, if he returned home without his guest; and, carrying Kamar al-Zaman to his house, seated him in a saloon that had not its match, Halimah saw him, as he entered, and was ravished with him. They talked till supper was served when they ate and drank; after which appeared coffee and sherbets, and the jeweller ceased not to entertain him with talk till eventide, when they prayed the obligatory prayers. Then entered a handmaid with two cups of night drink, which when they had drunk, drowsiness overcame them and they slept. Presently in came the jeweller's wife and seeing them asleep, looked upon Kamar al-Zaman's face and her wit was confounded at his beauty. Said she, ""How can he sleep who loveth the fair?"" and, turning him over on his back, sat astraddle upon his breast. Then, in the mania of her passion for him, she rained down kisses on his cheeks, till she left a mark upon them and they became exceeding red and his cheek bones shone; and, she sucked his lips, till the blood ran out into her mouth; but with all this, her fire was not quenched nor her thirst assuaged. She ceased not to kiss and clip him and twine leg with leg, till the forebrow of Morn grew white and the dawn broke forth in light; when she put in his pocket four cockals and went away. Then she sent her maid with something like snuff, which she applied to their nostrils and they sneezed and awoke, when the slave-girl said, ""O my lords, prayer is a duty; so rise ye and pray the dawn-prayer."" And she brought them basin and ewer. Quoth Kaman al-Zamar ""O master, 'tis late and we have overslept ourselves;"" and quoth the jeweller, ""O my friend verily the air of this room is heavy; for, whenever I sleep in it, this happens to me."" Rejoined Kamar al-Zaman, ""True,"" and proceeded to make the Wuzu ablution; but, when he put the water to his face, his cheeks and lips burned him. Cried he, ""Prodigious! If the air of the room be heavy and we have been drowned in sleep, what aileth my cheeks and lips that they burn me?"" And he said to the jeweller, ""O master, my cheeks and lips burn me."" The other replied, ""I guess this cometh of the mosquito bites."" ""Strange!"" said Kamar al-Zaman. ""Hath this thing happened to thee?"" Replied Obayd, ""No! But whenever I have by me a guest like thee, he complaineth in the morning of the mosquito bites, and this happeneth only when he is like thee beardless. If he be bearded the mosquitoes sting him not, and naught hindereth them from me but my beard. It seems mosquitoes love not bearded men."" Rejoined Kamar al-Zaman, ""True."" Then the maid brought them early breakfast and they broke their fast and went out. Kamar al-Zaman betook himself to the old woman, who exclaimed, when she saw him, ""I see the marks of joyance on thy face: tell me what thou hast seen."" Said he, ""I have seen nothing. Only I supped with the house master in a saloon and prayed the night prayer, after which we fell asleep and woke not till morning."" She laughed and said, ""What be those marks on thy cheeks and lips?"" He answered, ""'Twas the mosquitoes of the saloon that did this with me;"" and she rejoined, ""'Tis well. But did the same thing betide the house master?"" He retorted, ""Nay; but he told me that the mosquitoes of that saloon molest not bearded men, but sting those only who have no hair on face, and that whenever he hath for guest one who is beard less, the stranger awaketh complaining of the mosquito bites; whereas an he have a beard, there befalleth him naught of this."" Said she, ""Sooth thou speakest: but say me, sawest thou aught save this?"" And he answered, ""I found four cockals in my pocket."" Quoth she, ""Show them to me."" So he gave them to her and she laughed and said, ""Thy mistress laid these in thy pocket."" He asked, ""How so?"" And she answered, "" 'Tis as if she said to thee, in the language of signs, 'An thou wert in love, thou wouldst not sleep, for a lover sleepeth not: but thou hast not ceased to be a child and fit for nothing but to play with these cockals. So what crave thee to fall in love with the fair?' Now she came to thee by night and finding thee asleep, scored thy cheeks with her kisses and left thee this sign. But that will not suffice her of thee and she will certainly send her husband to invite thee again to night; so, when thou goest home with him, hasten not to fall asleep, and on the morrow bring me five hundred diners and come and acquaint me with what hath passed, and I will perfect for thee the device."" Answered he, ""I hear and obey,"" and went back to the Khan. Thus it befel him; but as regards the jeweller's wife, she said to her husband, ""Is the guest gone?"" Answered he, ""Yes, but, O Halimah,the mosquitoes plagued him last night and scarified his cheeks and lips, and indeed I was abashed before him."" She rejoined, ""This is the wont of the mosquitoes of our saloon; for they love none save the beardless. But do thou invite him again to night."" So he repaired to the Khan where the youth abode, and bidding him, carried him to his house, where they ate and drank and prayed the night prayer in the saloon, after which the slave-girl entered and gave each of them a cup of night drink, And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Nine Hundred and Seventy first Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the slave- girl went in to the twain and gave each of them a cup of night drink, and they drank and fell asleep. Presently, in came Halimah and said, ""O good for nothing, how canst thou sleep and call thy self a lover? A lover sleepeth not!"" Then she mounted on his breast and ceased not to come down upon him with kisses and caresses, biting and sucking his lips and so forth, till the morning. when she put in his pocket a knife and sent her handmaid to arouse them. And when the youth awoke, his cheeks were on fire, for excess of redness, and his lips like coral, for dint of sucking and kissing. Quoth the jeweller, ""Did the mosquitoes plague thee last night?""; and quoth the other, ""Nay!""; for he now knew the conceit and left complaining. Then he felt the knife in his pocket and was silent; but when he had broken his fast and drunk coffee, he left the jeweller and going to the Khan; took five hundred diners of gold and carried them to the old woman, to whom he related what had passed, saying, ""I slept despite myself, and when I woke at dawn I found nothing but a knife in my pocket."" Exclaimed the old trot, ""May Allah protect thee from her this next night! For she saith to thee by this sign, 'An thou sleep again, I will cut thy throat.' Thou wilt once more be bidden to the jeweller's house to night, and if thou sleep, she will slay thee."" Said he, ""What is to be done?""; and said she, ""Tell me what thou atest and drankest before sleeping."" Quoth he, ""We supped as was our wont and prayed the night prayer, after which there came in to us a maid, who gave each of us a cup of night drink, which when I had drunk, I fell asleep and awoke not till the morning."" Quoth the old woman, ""The mischief is in the cup: so, when the maid giveth it to thee, take it from her, but drink not and wait till the master of the house have drunken and fallen asleep; then say to her, 'Give me a draught of water,' and she will go to fetch thee the gugglet. Then do thou empty the cup behind the pillow and lie down and feign sleep. So when she cometh back with the gugglet, she will deem that thou hast fallen asleep, after having drunk off the cup, and will leave thee; and presently the case will appear to thee; but beware of disobeying my bidding."" Answered he, ""I hear and I obey,"" and returned to the Khan. Meanwhile the jeweller's wife said to her husband, ""A guest's due honour is three nights' entertainment: so do thou invite him a third time."" Whereupon he betook himself to the youth and inviting him, carried him home and sat down with him in the saloon. When they had supped and prayed the night prayer, behold, in came the handmaid and gave each of them a cup. Her master drank and fell asleep; but Kamar al-Zaman forbore to drink, whereupon quoth the maid, ""Wilt thou not drink, O my lord?"" Answered he, ""I am athirst, bring me the gugglet."" Accordingly she went to fetch it, and he emptied the cup behind the pillow and lay down. When the slave-girl returned, she saw him lying down and going to her mistress said, ""He hath drunk off the cup and fallen asleep;"" whereupon quoth Halimah to herself, ""Verily, his death is better than his life."" Then, taking a sharp knife, she went in to him, saying, ""Three times, and thou notedst not the sign, O fool! So now I will rip up thy maw."" When he saw her making for him knife in hand, he opened his eyes and rose, laughing; whereupon said she, ""'Twas not of thine own wit, that thou camest at the meaning of the sign, but by the help of some wily cheat; so tell me whence thou hadst this knowledge."" ""From an old woman,"" replied he, ""between whom and me befel such and such;"" and he told her all that had passed. Quoth she, ""To morrow go thou forth from us and seek her and say, 'Hast thou any further device in store?' And if she answer, 'I have,' do thou rejoin, 'Then do thy best that I may enjoy her publicly.' But, if she say, 'I have no means of doing that, and this is the last of my devices,' put her away from thy thought, and to morrow night my husband will come to thee and invite thee. Do thou come with him and tell me and I will consider what remaineth to be done."" Answered he, ""There is no harm in that!"" Then he spent the rest of the night with her in embracing and clipping, plying the particle of copulation in concert and joining the conjunctive with the conjoined, whilst her husband was as a cast-out nunnation of construction. And they ceased not to be thus till morning, when she said to him, ""'Tis not a night of thee that will content me, nor a day; no, nor yet a month nor a year; but it's my intent to abide with thee the rest of my life. Wait, however, till I play my husband a trick which would baffle the keenest witted and win for us our wishes. I will cause doubt to enter into him, so that he shall divorce me, whereupon I will marry thee and go with thee to thine own country; I will also transport all his monies and hoards to thy lodging and will contrive thee the ruin of his dwelling place and the blotting out of his traces. But do thou hearken to my speech and obey me in that I shall say to thee and gainsay me not."" He replied, ""I hear and I obey: in me there is none opposition."" Then said she, ""Go to the Khan and, when my husband cometh to thee and inviteth thee, say to him, 'O my brother, a son of Adam is apt to be burdensome, and when his visits grow over frequent, both generous and niggard loathe him. How then shall I go with thee every night and lie I and thee, on the saloon? An thou wax not chagrined with me, thy Harim will bear me grudge, for that I hinder thee from thine. Therefore if thou have a mind to my company, take me a house beside thine own and we will abide thus, now I sitting with thee till the time of sleep, and now with me thou. Then I will go to my place and thou to thy Harim and this will be a better rede than that I hinder thee from thy Harim every night.' Then will he come to me and take counsel with me, and I will advise him to turn out our neighbour, for the house wherein he liveth is our house and he renteth it of us; and once thou art in the house, Allah will make easy to us the rest of our scheme."" And presently she added, ""Go now and do as I bid thee."" Answered he, ""I hear and obey;"" whereupon she left him and went away, whilst he lay down and feigned to be asleep. Presently, the handmaid came and aroused them; and when the jeweller awoke, he said to his guest, ""O merchant have the mosquitoes worried thee?"" He replied, ""No,"" and Obayd said, ""Belike thou art grown used to them."" Then they broke their fast and drank coffee, after which they fared forth to their affairs, and Kamar al-Zaman betook himself to the old crone, and related to her what had passed, And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Nine Hundred and Seventy-second Night,
She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Kamar al-Zaman betook himself to the old crone, he related to her what had passed, saying, ""She spake to me this and that, and I answered her thus and thus. Now say me, hast thou any farther device for bringing me to enjoy her publicly?"" Quoth she, ""O my son, here endeth my contrivance, and now I am at the term of my devices."" Upon this he left her and returned to the Khan where, as eventide evened, the jeweller came to him and invited him. He said, ""I cannot go with thee."" Asked the merchant, ""Why so? I love thee and cannot brook separation from thee. Allah upon thee come with me!"" The other replied, ""An it be thy wish to continue our comradeship and keep up the friendship betwixt thee and me, take me a house by the side of thine own and when thou wilt, thou shalt pass the evening with me and I with thee; but, as soon as the time of sleep cometh, each of us shall hie him to his own home and lie there."" Quoth Obayd, ""I have a house adjoining mine, which is my own property: so go thou with me to night and to- morrow I will have the house untenanted for thee."" Accordingly he went with him and they supped and prayed the night prayer, after which the jeweller drank the cup of drugged liquor and fell asleep: but in Kamar al-Zaman's cup there was no trick; so he drank it and slept not. Then came the jeweller's wife and sat chatting with him through the dark hours, whilst her husband lay like a corpse. When he awoke in the morning as of wont, he sent for his tenant and said to him, ""O man, quit me the house, for I have need of it."" ""On my head and eyes,"" answered the other and voided the house to him, whereupon Kamar al-Zaman took up his abode therein and transported thither all his baggage. The jeweller passed that evening with him, then went to his own house. On the next day, his wife sent for a cunning builder and bribed him with money to make her an underground-way from her chamber to Kamar al-Zaman's house, with a trap-door under the earth. So, before the youth was ware, she came in to him with two bags of money and he said to her, ""Whence comest thou?"" She showed him the tunnel and said to him, ""Take these two bags of his money."" Then she sat with him, the twain toying and tumbling together till the morning, when she said, ""Wait for me, till I go to him and wake him, so he may go to his shop, and I return to thee."" He sat expecting her, whilst she went away and awoke her husband, who made the Wuzu ablution and prayed and went to his shop. As soon as he was gone, she took four bags and, carrying them through the Souterrain to Kamar al-Zaman, said to him, ""Store these up;"" then she sat with him awhile, after which she retired to her home and he betook himself to the bazar. When he returned at sundown, he found in his house ten purses and jewels and much besides. Presently the jeweller came to him and carried him to his own house, where they passed the evening in the saloon, till the handmaid came in according to custom, and brought them the drink. Her master drank and fell asleep, whilst naught betided Kamar al-Zaman for that his cup was wholesome and there was no trick therein. Then came Halimah who sat down atoying with him, whilst the slave-girl transported the jeweller's goods to Kamar al-Zaman's house by the secret passage. Thus they did till morning, when the handmaid awoke her lord and gave them to drink coffee, after which they went each his own way. On the third day the wife brought out to him a knife of her husband's, which he had chased and wrought with his own hand, and which he priced at five hundred diners. But there was no knife like it and because of the eagerness with which folk sought it of him, he had laid it up in a chest and could not bring himself to sell it to any one in creation. Quoth she, ""Take this knife and set it in thy waist shawl and go to my husband and sit with him. Then pull out the knife and say to him, 'O master, look at this knife I bought to day and tell me if I have the worst or the best of the bargain.' He will know it, but will be ashamed to say to thee, 'This is my knife;' so he will ask thee, 'Whence didst thou buy it and for how much?'; and do thou make answer, 'I saw two Levantines disputing and one said to the other, 'Where hast thou been?' Quoth his companion, 'I have been with my mistress, and whenever I foregather with her, she giveth me ten dirhams; but this day she said to me, 'My hand is empty of silver for thee to day, but take this knife of my husband's.' So I took it and intend to sell it.' The knife pleased me and hearing his tale I said to him, 'Wilt thou sell it to me?' when he replied, 'Buy.' So I got it of him for three hundred gold pieces and I wonder whether it was cheap or dear.' And note what he will say to thee. Then talk with him awhile and rise and come back to me in haste. Thou wilt find me awaiting thee at the tunnel mouth, and do thou give me the knife."" Replied Kamar al-Zaman, ""I hear and I obey,"" and taking the knife set it in his waist-shawl. Then he went to the shop of the jeweller, who saluted him with the salam and welcomed him and made him sit down. He spied the knife in his waist shawl, at which he wondered and said to himself, ""That is my knife: who can have conveyed it to this merchant?"" And he fell a musing and saying in his mind, ""I wonder an it be my knife or a knife like it!"" Presently Kamar al-Zaman pulled it out and said to him, ""Harkye, master; take this knife and look at it."" Obayd took it and knew it right well, but was ashamed to say, ""This is my knife;"" And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Nine Hundred and Seventy-third Night,
She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the jeweller took the knife from Kamar al-Zaman, he knew it, but was ashamed to say, ""This is my knife."" So he asked, ""Where didst thou buy it?"" Kamar al-Zaman answered as Halimah had charged him, and the jeweller said, ""The knife was cheap at that price, for it is worth five hundred diners."" But fire flamed in his heart and his hands were tied from working at his craft. Kamar al-Zaman continued to talk with him, whilst he was drowned in the sea of solicitudes, and for fifty words wherewith the youth bespoke him, he answered him but one; for his heart ached and his frame was racked and his thoughts were troubled and he was even as saith the poet,
""I have no words though folk would have me talk * And who bespeak
             me find me thought waylaid:
Plunged in the Care-sea's undiscovered depths, * Nor aught of
             difference see 'twixt man and maid!""
When Kamar al-Zaman saw his case thus changed, he said to him ""Belike thou art busy at this present,"" and leaving him, returned in hottest haste to his own house, where he found Halimah standing at the passage door awaiting him. Quoth she ""Hast thou done as I bade thee?""; and quoth he, ""Yes."" She asked, ""What said he to thee?""; and he answered, ""He told me that the knife was cheap at that price, for that it was worth five hundred diners: but I could see that he was troubled; so I left him and know not what befel him after that."" Cried she, ""Give me the knife and reck thou not of him."" Then she took the knife and restoring it to its place, sat down. Now after Kamar al-Zaman's departure fire flamed in the jeweller's heart and suspicion was sore upon him and he said to himself, ""Needs must I get up and go look for the knife and cut down doubt with certainty."" So he rose and repaired to his house and went in to his wife, snorting like a dragon; and she said to him, ""What mattereth thee, O my lord?"" He asked, ""Where is my knife?"" and she answered, ""In the chest,"" and smote hand upon breast, saying, ""O my grief! Belike thou hast fallen out with some one and art come to fetch the knife to smite him withal."" Said he, ""Give me the knife. Let me see it."" But said she, ""Not till thou swear to me that thou wilt not smite any one therewith."" So he swore this to her and she opened the chest and brought out to him the knife and he fell to turning it over, saying, ""Verily, this is a wondrous thing!"" Then quoth he to her, ""Take it and lay it back in its place;"" and she, ""Tell me the meaning of all this."" He answered, ""I saw with our friend a knife like this,"" and told her all that had passed between himself and the youth, adding, ""But, when I saw it in the chest, my suspicion ended in certainty."" Said she, ""Haply thou misdoubtedest of me and deemedst that I was the Levantine's mistress and had given him the knife."" He replied, ""Yes, I had my doubts of this; but, when I saw the knife, suspicion was lifted from my heart."" Rejoined she, ""O man, there is now no good in thee!"" And he fell to excusing himself to her, till he appeased her; after which he fared forth and returned to his shop. Next day, she gave Kamar al-Zaman her husband's watch, which he had made with his own hand and whereof none had the like, saying, ""Go to his shop and sit by his side and say to him, 'I saw again to- day him whom I saw yesterday. He had a watch in his hand and said to me, 'Wilt thou buy this watch?' Quoth I, 'Whence hadst thou it?'; and quoth he, 'I was with my mistress and she gave me this watch.' So I bought it of him for eight-and-fifty gold pieces. Look at it: is it cheap at that price or dear?' Note what he shall say to thee; then return to me in haste and give me the watch."" So Kamar al-Zaman repaired to the jeweller and did with him as she had charged him. When Obayd saw the watch, he said, ""This is worth seven hundred ducats;"" and suspicion entered into him. Then the youth left him and returning to the wife, gave her back the watch. Presently, her husband suddenly came in snorting, and said to her, ""Where is my watch?"" Said she, ""Here it is;"" and he cried, ""Give it to me."" So she brought it to him and he exclaimed, ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!""; and she too exclaimed, ""O man, there is something the matter with thee. Tell me what it is."" He replied, ""What shall I say? Verily, I am bewildered by these chances!"" And he recited these couplets,
""Although the Merciful be doubtless with me,
Yet am I sore bewildered, for new griefs
Have compassed me about, or ere I knew it
I have endured till Patience self became
Impatient of my patience.—I have endured
Waiting till Heaven fulfil my destiny.—
I have endured till e'en endurance owned
How I bore up with her; (a thing more bitter
Than bitter aloes) yet though a bitterer thing
Is not, than is that drug it were more bitter
To me should Patience leave me unsustained.""
Then said he to his wife, ""O woman, I saw with the merchant our friend, first my knife, which I knew, for that its fashion was a device of my own wit, nor cloth its like exist; and he told me of it a story that troubled the heart: so I came back and found it at home. Again to day I see him with the watch, whose fashion also is of my own device, nor is there the fellow of it in Bassorah, and of this also he told me a story that saddened my heart. Wherefore I am bewildered in my wit and know not what is to come to me."" Quoth she, ""The purport of thy speech is that thou suspectedst me of being the friend of that merchant and his leman, and eke of giving him thy good; so thou camest to question me and make proof of my perfidy; and, had I not shown thee the knife and the watch, thou hadst been certified of my treason. But since, O man, thou deemest me this ill deme, henceforth I will never again break with thee bread nor drain with thee drink, for I loathe thee with the loathing of prohibition."" So he gentled her and excused himself till he had appeased her and returned, repenting him of having bespoken her thus, to his shop, where he sat, And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Nine Hundred and Seventy-fourth Night,
She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the jeweller quitted his wife, he repented having bespoken her thus and, returning to his shop, he sat there in disquiet sore and anxiety galore, between belief and unbelief. About eventide he went home alone, not bringing Kamar al-Zaman with him: whereupon quoth his wife, ""Where is the merchant?""; and quoth he, ""In his lodgings."" She asked, ""Is the friendship between thee and him grown cold?"" and he answered, ""By Allah, I have taken a dislike to him, because of that which hath betided me from him."" Quoth she, ""Go fetch him, to please me."" So he arose and went in to Kamar al-Zaman in his house; where he saw his own goods strewn about and knew them. At this sight, fire was kindled in his heart and he fell asighing. Quoth the youth, ""How is it that I see thee melancholy?"" Obayd was ashamed to say, ""Here are my goods in thy house: who brought them hither?""; so he replied only, ""A vexation hath betided me; but come thou with me to my house, that we may solace ourselves there."" The other rejoined, ""Let me be in my place: I will not go with thee."" But the jeweller conjured him to come and took him to his house, where they supped and passed the evening together, Kamar al-Zaman talking with the jeweller, who was drowned in the sea of solicitude and for a hundred words, wherewith the guest bespoke him, answered him only one word. Presently, the handmaid brought them two cups of drink, as usual, and they drank; whereupon the jeweller fell asleep, but the youth abode on wake, because his cup was not drugged. Then came Halimah and said to her lover, ""How deemest thou of yonder cornuted, who is drunken in his heedlessness and weeteth not the wiles of women? There is no help for it but that I cozen him into divorcing me. To-morrow, I will disguise myself as a slave-girl and walk after thee to his shop, where do thou say to him, 'O master, I went to-day into the Khan of Al-Yasirjiyah, where I saw this damsel and bought her for a thousand diners. Look at her for me and tell me whether she was cheap at that price or dear.' Then uncover to him my face and breasts and show all of me to him; after which do thou carry me back to thy house, whence I will go to my chamber by the secret passage, so I may see the issue of our affair with him."" Then the twain passed the night in mirth and merriment, converse and good cheer, dalliance and delight till dawn, when she returned to her own place and sent the handmaid to arouse her lawful lord and her lover. Accordingly they arose and prayed the dawn-prayer and brake their fast and drank coffee, after which Obayd repaired to his shop and Kamar al-Zaman betook himself to his own house. Presently, in came Halimah to him by the tunnel, in the guise of a slave-girl, and indeed she was by birth a slave-girl. Then he went out and she walked behind him, till he came to the jeweller's shop and saluting him, sat down and said, ""O master, I went into the Khan of Al-Yasirjiyah to-day, to look about me, and saw this damsel in the broker's hands. She pleased me; so I bought her for a thousand diners and I would have thee look upon her and see if she be cheap at that price or no."" So saying, he uncovered her face and the jeweller saw her to be his own wife. clad in her costliest clothes, tricked out in her finest trinkets and kohl'd and henna'd, even as she was wont to adorn herself before him in the house. He knew with full knowledge her face and dress and trinkets, for those he had wrought with his own hand, and he saw on her fingers the seal rings he had newly made for Kamar al- Zaman, whereby he was certified with entire assurance that she was indeed his very wife. So he asked her, ""What is thy name, O slave-girl?""; and she answered, ""Halimah,"" naming to him her own name; whereat he was amazed and said to the youth, ""For how much didst thou buy her?"" He replied, ""For a thousand diners""; and the jeweller rejoined, ""Thou hast gotten her gratis; for her rings and clothes and trinkets are worth more than that."" Said Kamar al-Zaman, ""May Allah rejoice thee with good news! Since she pleaseth thee, I will carry her to my house;"" and Obayd said, ""Do thy will."" So he took her off to his house, whence she passed through the secret passage to her own apartment and sat there. Meanwhile, fire flamed in the jeweller's heart and he said to himself, ""I will go see my wife. If she be at home, this slave- girl must be her counterpart, and glory be to Him who alone hath no counterpart! But, if she be not at home, 'tis she herself without a doubt."" Then he set off running, and coming to his house, found his wife sitting in the same clothes and ornaments he had seen upon her in the shop; whereupon he beat hand upon hand, saying, ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!"" ""O man,"" asked she, ""art thou mad or what aileth thee? 'Tis not thy wont to do thus, and needs must it be that something hath befallen thee."" Answered he, ""If thou wilt have me tell thee be not vexed."" Quoth she, ""Say on""; so he said, ""Our friend the merchant hath bought a slave-girl, whose shape is as thy shape and her height as thy height; more- over, her name is even as thy name and her apparel is the like of thine apparel. Brief, she resembleth thee in all her attributes, and on her fingers are seal rings like thy seal rings and her trinkets are as thy trinkets. So, when he displayed her to me, methought it was thyself and I was perplexed concerning my case. Would we had never seen this merchant nor companied with him; and would he had never left his own country and we had not known him, for he hath troubled my life which before was serene, causing ill feeling to succeed good faith and making doubt to enter into my heart."" Said she, ""Look in my face, belike I am she who was with him and he is my lover and I disguised myself as a slave-girl and agreed with him that he should display me to thee, so he might lay a snare for thee."" He replied, ""What words are these? Indeed, I never suspected that thou wouldst do the like of this deed."" Now this jeweller was unversed in the wiles of women and knew not how they deal with men, nor had he heard the saying of him who said,
""A heart bore thee off in chase of the fair, * As fled Youth and
           came Age wi' his hoary hair:
Laylá troubles me and love joys are far; * And rival and risks
           brings us cark and care.
An would'st ask me of woman, behold I am * In physic of womankind
           wise and ware:
When grizzleth man's head and his monies fail, * His lot in their
           love is a poor affair.""
Nor that of another,
""Gainsay women; he obeyeth Allah best, who saith them nay And he
           prospers not who giveth them his bridle rein to sway
For they'll hinder him from winning to perfection in his gifts,
           Though a thousand years he study, seeking after wisdom's
           way.""
And a third,
""Women Satans are, made for woe of man: * To Allah I fly from
           such Satanesses!
Whom they lure by their love he to grief shall come * And lose
             bliss of world and the Faith that blesses.""
Said she, ""Here am I sitting in my chamber; so go thou to him forthright and knock at the door and contrive to go in to him quickly. An thou see the damsel with him 'tis a slave-girl of his who resembleth me (and Glory be to Him who hath no resemblance) But, an thou see no slave-girl with him, then am I myself she whom thou sawest with him in the shop, and thine ill thought of me will be stablished."" ""True,"" answered Obayd, and went out leaving her, whereupon she passed through the hidden passage and seating herself by Kamar al-Zaman, told him what had passed, saying, ""Open the door quickly and show me to him."" Now, as they were talking, behold, there came a knocking at the door. Quoth Kamar al-Zaman, ""Who is at the door?""; and quoth the jeweller, ""I, thy friend; thou displayedst to me thy slave- girl in the bazar, and I rejoiced for thee in her, but my joy in her was not completed; so open the door and let me look at her again."" Rejoined he, ""So be it,"" and opened the door to him, whereupon he saw his wife sitting by him. She rose and kissed their hands; and he looked at her; then she talked with him awhile and he saw her not to be distinguished from his wife in aught and said, ""Allah createth whatso He will."" Then he went away more disheartened than before and returned to his own house where he saw his wife sitting, for she had foregone him thither by the souterrain. And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Nine Hundred and Seventy-fifth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the young lady forewent her spouse by the souterrain as he fared through the door and sat down in her upper chamber; so as soon as he entered she asked him, ""What hast thou seen?"" and he answered, ""I found her with her master; and she resembleth thee."" Then said she, ""Off to thy shop and let this suffice thee of ignoble suspicion and never again deem ill of me."" Said he, ""So be it: accord me pardon for what is past."" And she, ""Allah grant thee grace!"" whereupon he kissed her right and left and went back to his shop. Then she again betook herself to Kamar al-Zaman through the underground passage, with four bags of money, and said to him, ""Equip thyself at once for the road and be ready to carry off the money without delay, against I devise for thee the device I have in mind."" So he went out and purchased mules and loaded them and made ready a travelling litter, he also bought Mamelukes and eunuchs and sending, without let or hindrance, the whole without the city, returned to Halimah and said to her, ""I have made an end of my affairs."" Quoth she, ""And I on my side am ready; for I have transported to thy house all the rest of his monies and treasures and have left him nor little nor much, whereof he may avail himself. All this is of my love for thee, O dearling of my heart, for I would sacrifice my husband to thee a thousand times. But now it behoveth, thou go to him and farewell him, saying, 'I purpose to depart after three days and am come to bid thee adieu; so do thou reckon what I owe thee for the hire of the house that I may send it to thee and acquit my conscience.' Note his reply and return to me and tell me; for I can no more; I have done my best, by cozening him, to anger him with me and cause him to put me away, but I find him none the less infatuated with me. So nothing will serve us but to depart to thine own country."" And quoth he, ""O rare! an but swevens prove true!"" Then he went to the jeweller's shop and sitting down by him, said to him, ""O master, I set out for home in three days' time, and am come to farewell thee. So I would have thee reckon what I owe thee for the hire of the house, that I may pay it to thee and acquit my conscience."" Answered Obayd, ""What talk is this? Verily, 'tis I who am indebted to thee. By Allah, I will take nothing from thee for the rent of the house, for thou hast brought down blessings upon us! However, thou desolatest me by thy departure, and but that it is forbidden to me, I would certainly oppose thee and hinder thee from returning to thy country and kinsfolk."" Then he took leave of him, whilst they both wept with sore weeping and the jeweller went with him, and when they entered Kamar al-Zaman's house, there they found Halimah who stood before them and served them; but when Obayd returned home, he found her sitting there; nor did he cease to see her thus in each house in turn, for the space of three days, when she said to Kamar al-Zaman, ""Now have I transported to thee all that he hath of monies and hoards and carpets and things of price, and there remaineth with him naught save the slave-girl, who used to come in to you with the night drink: but I cannot part with her, for that she is my kinswoman and she is dear to me as a confidante. So I will beat her and be wroth with her and when my spouse cometh home, I will say to him, 'I can no longer put up with this slave-girl nor stay in the house with her; so take her and sell her.' Accordingly he will sell her and do thou buy her, that we may carry her with us."" Answered he, ""No harm in that."" So she beat the girl and when the jeweller came in, he found her weeping and asked her why she wept. Quoth she, ""My mistress hath beaten me."" He then went in to his wife and said to her, ""What hath that accursed girl done, that thou hast beaten her?"" She replied, ""O man, I have but one word to say to thee, and 'tis that I can no longer bear the sight of this girl; so take her and sell her, or else divorce me."" Quoth he, ""I will sell her that I may not cross thee in aught;"" and when he went out to go to the shop he took her and passed with her by Kamar al-Zaman. No sooner had he gone out than his wife slipped through the under ground passage to Kamar al-Zaman, who placed her in the litter, before the Shaykh her husband reached him. When the jeweller came up and the lover saw the slave-girl with him, he asked him, ""What girl is this?""; and the other answered, ""'Tis my slave-girl who used to serve us with the night drink; she hath disobeyed her mistress who is wroth with her and hath bidden me sell her."" Quoth the youth, ""An her mistress have taken an aversion to her, there is for her no abiding with her; but sell her to me, that I may smell your scent in her, and I will make her handmaid to my slave Halimah."" ""Good,"" answered Obayd: ""take her."" Asked Kamar al-Zaman, ""What is her price?""; but the jeweller said, ""I will take nothing from thee, for thou hast been bountiful to us."" So he accepted her from him and said to Halimah, ""Kiss thy lord's hand."" Accordingly, she came out from the litter and kissing Obayd's hand, remounted, whilst he looked hard at her. Then said Kamar al-Zaman, ""I commend thee to Allah, O Master Obayd! Acquit my conscience of responsibility."" Answered the jeweller, ""Allah acquit thee! and carry thee safe to thy family!"" Then he bade him farewell and went to his shop weeping, and indeed it was grievous to him to part from Kamar al- Zaman, for that he had been friend and friendship hath its debtorship; yet he rejoiced in the dispelling of the doubts which had befallen him anent his wife, since the young man was now gone and his suspicions had not been stablished. Such was his case; but as regards Kamar al-Zaman, the young lady said to him, ""An thou wish for safety, travel with me by other than the wonted way."" And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Nine Hundred and Seventy-sixth Night,
She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Halimah said to Kamar al-Zaman, ""An thou wish for safety travel with me by other than the wonted way,"" he replied, ""Hearing and obeying;"" and, taking a road other than that used by folk, fared on without ceasing from region to region till he reached the confines of Egypt-land and sent his sire a letter by a runner. Now his father the merchant Abd al-Rahman was sitting in the market among the merchants, with a heart on fire for separation from his son, because no news of the youth had reached him since the day of his departure; and while he was in such case the runner came up and cried, ""O my lords, which of you is called the merchant Abd al-Rahman?"" They said, ""What wouldst thou of him?""; and he said, ""I have a letter for him from his son Kamar al-Zaman, whom I left at Al-Arísh."" At this Abd al-Rahman rejoiced and his breast was broadened and the merchants rejoiced for him and gave him joy of his son's safety. Then he opened the letter and read as follows, ""From Kamar al-Zaman to the merchant Abd al-Rahman. And after Peace be upon thee and upon all the merchants! An ye ask concerning us, to Allah be the praise and the thanks. Indeed we have sold and bought and gained and are come back in health, wealth and weal."" Whereupon Abd al-Rahman opened the door of rejoicing and made banquets and gave feasts and entertainments galore, sending for instruments of music and addressing himself to festivities after rarest fashion. When Kamar al-Zaman came to Al-Sálihiyah, his father and all the merchants went forth to meet him, and Abd al-Rahman embraced him and strained him to his bosom and sobbed till he swooned away. When he came to himself he said, ""Oh, 'tis a boon day O my son, whereon the Omnipotent Protector hath reunited us with thee!"" And he repeated the words of the bard,
""The return of the friend is the best of all boons, * And the joy
           cup circles o' morns and noons:
So well come, welcome, fair welcome to thee, * The light of the
          time and the moon o' full moons.""
Then, for excess of joy, he poured forth a flood of tears from his eyes and he recited also these two couplets,
""The Moon o' the Time, shows unveilèd light; * And, his
          journey done, at our door cloth alight:
His locks as the nights of his absence are black * And the sun
          upstands from his collar's white.""
Then the merchants came up to him and saluting him, saw with him many loads and servants and a travelling litter enclosed in a spacious circle. So they took him and carried him home; and when Halimah came forth from the litter, his father held her a seduction to all who beheld her. So they opened her an upper chamber, as it were a treasure from which the talismans had been loosed; and when his mother saw her, she was ravished with her and deemed her a Queen of the wives of the Kings. So she rejoiced in her and questioned her; and she answered, ""I am wife to thy son;"" and the mother rejoined, ""Since he is wedded to thee we must make thee a splendid marriage feast, that we may rejoice in thee and in my son."" On this wise it befel her; but as regards the merchant Abd al-Rahman, when the folk had dispersed and each had wended his way, he foregathered with his son and said to him, ""O my son, what is this slave-girl thou hast brought with thee and for how much didst thou buy her?"" Kamar al-Zaman said, ""O my father, she is no slave-girl; but 'tis she who was the cause of my going abroad."" Asked his sire, ""How so?""; and he answered, ""'Tis she whom the Dervish described to us the night he lay with us; for indeed my hopes crave to her from that moment and I sought not to travel save on account of her. The Arabs came out upon me by the way and stripped me and took my money and goods, so that I entered Bassorah alone and there befel me there such and such things;"" and he went on to relate to his parent all that had befallen him from commencement to conclusion. Now when he had made an end of his story, his father said to him, ""O my son, and after all this didst thou marry her?"" ""No; but I have promised her marriage."" ""Is it thine intent to marry her?"" ""An thou bid me marry her, I will do so; otherwise I will not marry her."" Thereupon quoth his father, ""An thou marry her, I am quit of thee in this world and in the next, and I shall be incensed against thee with sore indignation. How canst thou wed her, seeing that she hath dealt thus with her husband? For, even as she did with her spouse for thy sake, so will she do the like with thee for another's sake, because she is a traitress and in a traitor there is no trusting. Wherefore an thou disobey me, I shall be wroth with thee; but, an thou give ear to my word, I will seek thee out a girl handsomer than she, who shall be pure and pious, and marry thee to her, though I spend all my substance upon her; and I will make thee a wedding without equal and will glory in thee and in her; for 'tis better that folk should say, Such an one hath married such an one's daughter, than that they say, He hath wedded a slave-girl sans birth or worth."" And he went on to persuade his son to give up marrying her, by citing in support of his say, proofs, stories, examples, verses and moral instances, till Kamar al-Zaman exclaimed, ""O my father, since the case is thus, 'tis not right and proper that I marry her."" And when his father heard him speak on such wise, he kissed him between the eyes, saying, ""Thou art my very son, and as I live, O my son, I will assuredly marry thee to a girl who hath not her equal!"" Then the merchant set Obayd's wife and her handmaid in a chamber high up in the house and, before locking the door upon the twain, he appointed a black slave-girl to carry them their meat and drink and he said to Halimah, ""Ye shall abide imprisoned in this chamber, thou and thy maid, till I find one who will buy you, when I will sell you to him. An ye resist, I will slay ye both, for thou art a traitress, and there is no good in thee."" Answered she, ""Do thy will: I deserve all thou canst do with me."" Then he locked the door upon them and gave his Harim a charge respecting them, saying, ""Let none go up to them nor speak with them, save the black slave-girl who shall give them their meat and drink through the casement of the upper chamber."" So she abode with her maid, weeping and repenting her of that which she had done with her spouse. Meanwhile Abd al-Rahman sent out the marriage brokers to look out a maid of birth and worth for his son, and the women ceased not to make search, and as often as they saw one girl, they heard of a fairer than she, till they came to the house of the Shaykh al-Islam and saw his daughter. In her they found a virgin whose equal was not in Cairo for beauty and loveliness, symmetry and perfect grace, and she was a thousand fold handsomer than the wife of Obayd. So they told Abd al-Rahman of her and he and the notables repaired to her father and sought her in wedlock of him. Then they wrote out the marriage contract and made her a splendid wedding; after which Abd al-Rahman gave bride feasts and held open house forty days. On the first day, he invited the doctors of the law and they held a splendid nativity: and on the morrow, he invited all the merchants, and so on during the rest of the forty days, making a banquet every day to one or other class of folk, till he had bidden all the Olema and Emirs and Antients and Magistrates, whilst the kettle drums were drummed and the pipes were piped and the merchant sat to greet the guests, with his son by his side, that he might solace himself by gazing on the folk, as they ate from the trays. Each night Abd al-Rahman illuminated the street and the quarter with lamps and there came every one of the mimes and jugglers and mountebanks and played all manner play; and indeed it was a peerless wedding. On the last day he invited the Fakirs, the poor and the needy, far and near, and they flocked in troops and ate, whilst the merchant sat, with his son by his side. And among the paupers, behold, entered Shaykh Obayd the jeweller and he was naked and weary and bare on his face the marks of wayfare. When Kamar al-Zaman saw him, he knew him and said to his sire, ""Look, O my father, at yonder poor man who is but now come in by the door."" So he looked and saw him clad in worn clothes and on him a patched gown worth two dirhams: his face was yellow and he was covered with dust and was as he were an offcast of the pilgrims. He was groaning as groaneth a sick man in need, walking with a tottering gait and swaying now to the right and then to the left, and in him was realized his saying who said,
""Lack-gold abaseth man and cloth his worth away, Even as the
            setting sun that pales with ended day.
He passeth 'mongst the folk and fain would hide his head; And
            when alone, he weeps with tears that never stay.
Absent, none taketh heed to him or his concerns; Present, he hath
            no part in life or pleasance aye.
By Allah, whenas men with poverty are cursed, But strangers midst
            their kin and countrymen are they!""
And the saying of another,
""The poor man fares by everything opposed: * On him to shut the
            door Earth ne'er shall fail:
Thou seest men abhor him sans a sin, * And foes he finds tho none
            the cause can tell:
The very dogs, when sighting wealthy man, * Fawn at his feet and
            wag the flattering tail;
Yet, an some day a pauper loon they sight, * All at him bark and,
            gnashing fangs, assail.""
And how well quoth a third,
""If generous youth be blessed with luck and wealth, *
             Displeasures fly his path and perils fleet:
His enviers pimp for him and par'site-wise * E'en without tryst
           his mistress hastes to meet.
When loud he farts they say 'How well he sings!' * And when he
             fizzles cry they, 'Oh, how sweet!'""
—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Nine Hundred and Seventy-seventh Night,
She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when his son said to Abd al-Rahman, ""Look at yonder pauper!"" he asked, ""O my son, who is this?"" And Kamar al-Zaman answered, ""This is Master Obayd the jeweller, husband of the woman who is imprisoned with us."" Quoth Abd al-Rahman, ""Is this he of whom thou toldest me?""; and quoth his son, ""Yes; and indeed I wot him right well."" Now the manner of Obayd's coming thither was on this wise. When he had farewelled Kamar al-Zaman, he went to his shop and thence going home, laid his hand on the door whereupon it opened and he entered and found neither his wife nor the slave-girl, but saw the house in sorriest plight, quoting in mute speech his saying who said,
""The chambers were like a bee hive well stocked: * When their bees quitted it, they became empty.""
When he saw the house void, he turned right and left and presently went round about the place, like a madman, but came upon no one. Then he opened the door of his treasure closet, but found therein naught of his money nor his hoards; whereupon he recovered from the intoxication of fancy and shook off his infatuation and knew that it was his wife herself who had turned the tables upon him and outwitted him with her wiles. He wept for that which had befallen him, but kept his affair secret, so none of his foes might exult over him nor any of his friends be troubled, knowing that, if he disclosed his secret, it would bring him naught but dishonour and contumely from the folk; wherefore he said in him self, ""O Obayd, hide that which hath betided thee of affliction and ruination; it behoveth thee to do in accordance with his saying who said,
'If a man's breast with bane he hides be straitenèd, * The breast that tells its hidden bale is straiter still.' ""
Then he locked up his house and, making for his shop, gave it in charge of one of his apprentices to whom said he, ""My friend the young merchant hath invited me to accompany him to Cairo, for solacing ourselves with the sight of the city, and sweareth that he will not march except he carry us with him, me and my wife. So, O my son, I make thee my steward in the shop, and if the King ask for me, say thou to him, 'He is gone with his Harim to the Holy House of Allah.'"" Then he sold some of his effects and bought camels and mules and Mamelukes, together with a slave- girl, and placing her in a litter, set out from Bassorah after ten days. His friends farewelled him and none doubted but that he had taken his wife and gone on the Pilgrimage, and the folk rejoiced in this, for that Allah had delivered them from being shut up in the mosques and houses every Friday. Quoth some of them, ""Allah grant he may never return to Bassorah, so we may no more be boxed up in the mosques and houses every Friday!""; for that this usage had caused the people of Bassorah exceeding vexation. Quoth another, ""Methinks he will not return from this journey, by reason of the much praying of the people of Bassorah against him."" And yet another, ""An he return, 'twill not be but in reversed case."" So the folk rejoiced with exceeding joy in the jeweller's departure, after they had been in mighty great chagrin, and even their cats and dogs were comforted. When Friday came round, however, the crier proclaimed as usual that the people should repair to the mosques two hours before prayer time or else hide themselves in their houses, together with their cats and dogs; whereat their breasts were straitened and they assembled in general assembly and betaking themselves to the King's divan, stood between his hands and said, ""O King of the age, the jeweller hath taken his Harim and departed on the pilgrimage to the Holy House of Allah: so the cause of our restrains hath ceased to be, and why therefore are we now shut up?"" Quoth the King, ""How came this traitor to depart without telling me? But, when he cometh back from his journey, all will not be save well: so go ye to your shops and sell and buy, for this vexation is removed from you."" Thus far concerning the King and the Bassorites; but as for the jeweller, he fared on ten days' journey, and as he drew near Baghdad, there befel him that which had befallen Kamar al-Zaman, before his entering Bassorah; for the Arabs came out upon him and stripped him and took all he had and he escaped only by feigning himself dead. As soon as they were gone, he rose and fared on, naked as he was, till he came to a village, where Allah inclined to him the hearts of certain kindly folk, who covered his shame with some old clothes; and he asked his way, begging from town to town, till he reached the city of Cairo the God guarded. There, burning with hunger, he went about alms seeking in the market streets, till one of the townsfolk said to him, ""O poor man, off with thee to the house of the wedding festival and eat and drink; for to day there is open table for paupers and strangers."" Quoth he, ""I know not the way thither"": and quoth the other, ""Follow me and I will show it to thee."" He followed him, till he brought him to the house of Abd al-Rahman and said to him, ""This is the house of the wedding; enter and fear not, for there is no doorkeeper at the door of the festival."" Accordingly he entered and Kamar al- Zaman knew him and told his sire who said, ""O my son, leave him at this present: belike he is anhungered: so let him eat his sufficiency and recover himself and after we will send for him."" So they waited till Obayd had eaten his fill and washed his hands and drunk coffee and sherbets of sugar flavoured with musk and ambergris and was about to go out, when Abd al-Rahman sent after him a page who said to him, ""Come, O stranger, and speak with the merchant Abd al-Rahman."" ""Who is he?"" asked Obayd; and the man answered, ""He is the master of the feast."" Thereupon the jeweller turned back, thinking that he meant to give him a gift, and coming up to Abd al-Rahman, saw his friend Kamar al-Zaman and went nigh to lose his senses for shame before him. But Kamar al- Zaman rose to him and embracing him, saluted him with the salam, and they both wept with sore weeping. Then he seated him by his side and Abd al-Rahman said to his son, ""O destitute of good taste, this is no way to receive friends! Send him first to the Hammam and despatch after him a suit of clothes of the choicest, worth a thousand dinars."" Accordingly they carried him to the bath, where they washed his body and clad him in a costly suit, and he became as he were Consul of the Merchants. Meanwhile the bystanders questioned Kamar al-Zaman of him, saying, ""Who is this and whence knowest thou him?"" Quoth he, ""This is my friend, who lodged me in his house and to whom I am indebted for favours without number, for that he entreated me with exceeding kindness. He is a man of competence and condition and by trade a jeweller, in which craft he hath no equal. The King of Bassorah loveth him dearly and holdeth him in high honour and his word is law with him."" And he went on to enlarge before them on his praises, saying, ""Verily, he did with me thus and thus and I have shame of him and know not how to requite him his generous dealing with me."" Nor did he leave to extol him, till his worth was magnified to the bystanders and he became venerable in their eyes; so they said, ""We will all do him his due and honour him for thy sake. But we would fain know the reason why he hath departed his native land and the cause of his coming hither and what Allah hath done with him, that he is reduced to this plight?"" Replied Kamar al- Zaman, ""O folk, marvel not, for a son of Adam is still subject to Fate and Fortune, and what while he abideth in this world, he is not safe from calamities. Indeed he spake truly who said these couplets,
The world tears man to shreds, so be thou not * Of those whom
           lure of rank and title draws:
Nay; 'ware of slips and turn from sin aside * And ken that bane
           and bale are worldly laws:
How oft high Fortune falls by least mishap * And all things bear
            inbred of change a cause!'
Know that I entered Bassorah in yet iller case and worse distress than this man, for that he entered Cairo with his shame hidden by rags; but I indeed came into his town with my nakedness uncovered, one hand behind and another before; and none availed me but Allah and this dear man. Now the reason of this was that the Arabs stripped me and took my camels and mules and loads and slaughtered my pages and serving men; but I lay down among the slain and they thought that I was dead, so they went away and left me. Then I arose and walked on, mother naked, till I came to Bassorah where this man met me and clothed me and lodged me in his house, he also furnished me with money, and all I have brought back with me I owe to none save to Allah's goodness and his goodness. When I departed, he gave me great store of wealth and I returned to the city of my birth with a heart at ease. I left him in competence and condition, and haply there hath befallen him some bale of the banes of Time, that hath forced him to quit his kinsfolk and country, and there happened to him by the way the like of what happened to me. There is nothing strange in this; but now it behoveth me to requite him his noble dealing with me and do according to the saying of him who saith,
'O who praises"" Time with the fairest appraise, * Knowest thou
            what Time hath made and unmade?
What thou dost at least be it kindly done, * For with pay
            he pays shall man be repaid.'""
As they were talking and telling the tale, behold, up came Obayd as he were Consul of the Merchants; whereupon they all rose to salute him and seated him in the place of honour. Then said Kamar al-Zaman to him, ""O my friend, verily, thy day is blessed and fortunate! There is no need to relate to me a thing that befel me before thee. If the Arabs have stripped thee and robbed thee of thy wealth, verily our money is the ransom of our bodies, so let not thy soul be troubled; for I entered thy city naked and thou clothedst me and entreatedst me generously, and I owe thee many a kindness. But I will requite thee.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say,
When it was the Nine Hundred and Seventy-eighth Night,
She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al-Zaman said to Master Obayd the jeweller, ""Verily I entered thy city naked and thou clothedst me and I owe thee many a kindness. But I will requite thee and do with thee even as thou didst with me; nay, more: so be of good cheer and eyes clear of tear."" And he went on to soothe him and hinder him from speech, lest he should name his wife and what she had done with him nor did he cease to ply him with saws and moral instances and verses and conceits and stories and legends and console him, till the jeweller saw his drift and took the hint and kept silence concerning the past, diverting himself with the tales and rare anecdotes he heard and repeating in himself these lines,
""On the brow of the World is a writ; an thereon thou look, * Its
            contents will compel thine eyes tears of blood to rain:
For the World never handed to humans a cup with its right, * But
            with left it compelled them a beaker of ruin to drain.""
Then Kamar al-Zaman and his father took Obayd and carrying him into the saloon of the Harim, shut themselves up with him; and Abd al-Rahman said to him, ""We did not hinder thee from speaking before the folk, but for fear of dishonour to thee and to us: but now we are private; so tell me all that hath passed between thee and thy wife and my son."" So he told him all, from beginning to end, and when he had made an end of his story, Abd al-Rahman asked him, ""Was the fault with my son or with thy wife?"" He answered, ""By Allah, thy son was not to blame, for men must needs lust after women, and 'tis the bounder duty of women to defend themselves from men. So the sin lieth with my wife, who played me false and did with me these deeds."" Then Abd al-Rahman arose and taking his son aside, said to him, ""O my son, we have proved his wife and know her to be a traitress; and now I mean to prove him and see if he be a man of honour and manliness, or a wittol."" ""How so?"" asked Kamar al-Zaman; and Abd al- Rahman answered, ""I mean to urge him to make peace with his wife, and if he consent thereto and forgive her, I will smite him with a sword and slay him and kill her after, her and her maid, for there is no good in the life of a cuckold and a queen; but, if he turn from her with aversion I will marry him to thy sister and give him more of wealth than that thou tookest from him."" Then he went back to Obayd and said to him, ""O master, verily, the commerce of women requireth patience and magnanimity and whoso loveth them hath need of fortitude, for that they order themselves viper wise towards men and evilly entreat them, by reason of their superiority over them in beauty and loveliness: wherefore they magnify themselves and belittle men. This is notably the case when their husbands show them affection; for then they requite them with hauteur and coquetry and harsh dealing of all kinds. But, if a man be wroth whenever he seeth in his wife aught that offendeth him, there can be no fellowship between them; nor can any hit it off with them who is not magnanimous and long suffering; and unless a man bear with his wife and requite her foul doing with forgiveness, he shall get no good of her conversation. Indeed, it hath been said of them, 'Were they in the sky, the necks of men would incline themwards'; and he who hath the power and pardoneth, his reward is with Allah. Now this woman is thy wife and thy companion and she hath long consorted with thee; wherefore it behoveth that thou entreat her with indulgence which in fellowship is of the essentials of success. Furthermore, women fail in wit and Faith, and if she have sinned, she repenteth and Inshallah she will not again return to that which she whilome did. So 'tis my rede that thou make peace with her and I will restore thee more than the good she took; and if it please thee to abide with me, thou art welcome, thou and she, and ye shall see naught but what shall joy you both; but, an thou seek to, return to thine own land. For that which falleth out between a man and his wife is manifold, and it behoveth thee to be indulgent and not take the way of the violent."" Said the jeweller, ""O my lord, and where is my wife?"" and said Abd al-Rahman, ""She is in that upper chamber, go up to her and be easy with her, for my sake, and trouble her not; for, when my son brought her hither, he would have married her, but I forbade him from her and shut her up in yonder room, and locked the door upon her saying in myself, 'Haply her husband will come and I will hand her over to him safe; for she is fair of favour, and when a woman is like unto this one, it may not be that her husband will let her go.' What I counted on is come about and praised be Allah Almighty for thy reunion with thy wife! As for my son, I have sought him another woman in marriage and have married him to her: these banquets and rejoicings are for his wedding, and to-night I bring him to his bride. So here is the key of the chamber where thy wife is: take it and open the door and go in to her and her handmaid and be buxom with her. There shall be brought you meat and drink and thou shalt not come down from her till thou have had thy fill of her."" Cried Obayd, ""May Allah requite thee for me with all good, O my lord!"" and taking the key, went up, rejoicing. The other thought his words had pleased him and that he consented thereto; so he took the sword and following him unseen, stood to espy what should happen between him and his wife. This is how it fared with the merchant Abd al-Rahman; but as for the jeweller, when he came to the chamber door, he heard his wife weeping with sore weeping for that Kamar al-Zaman had married another than her, and the handmaid saying to her, ""O my lady, how often have I warned thee and said, 'Thou wilt get no good of this youth: so do thou leave his company.' But thou heededst not my words and spoiledst thy husband of all his goods and gayest them to him. After the which thou forsookest thy place, of thine fondness and infatuation for him, and camest with him to this country. And now he hath cast thee out from his thought and married another and hath made the issue of thy foolish fancy for him to be durance vile."" Cried Halimah, ""Be silent, O accursed! Though he be married to another, yet some day needs must I occur to his thought. I cannot forget the nights I have spent in his company and in any case I console myself with his saying who said,
'O my lords, shall he to your mind occur * Who recurs to you only
             sans other mate?
Grant Heaven you ne'er shall forget his state * Who for state of
            you forgot own estate!'
It cannot be but he will bethink him of my affect and converse and ask for me, wherefore I will not turn from loving him nor change from passion for him, though I perish in prison; for he is my love and my leach and my reliance is on him that he will yet return to me and deal fondly with me."" When the jeweller heard his wife's words, he went in to her and said to her, ""O traitress, thy hope in him is as the hope of Iblis in Heaven. All these vices were in thee and I knew not thereof; for, had I been ware of one single vice, I had not kept thee with me an hour. But now I am certified of this in thee, it behoveth me to do thee die although they put me to death for thee, O traitress!"" and he clutched her with both hands and repeated these two couplets,
""O fair ones forth ye cast my faithful love * With sin, nor had
            ye aught regard for right:
How long I fondly clung to you, but now * My love is loathing and
            I hate your sight.""
Then he pressed hardly upon her windpipe and brake her neck, whereupon her handmaid cried out ""Alas, my mistress!"" Said he, ""O harlot, 'tis thou who art to blame for all this, for that thou knewest this evil inclination to be in her and toldest me not."" Then he seized upon her and strangled her. All this happened while Abd al-Rahman stood, brand in hand, behind the door espying with his eyes and hearing with his ears. Now when Obayd the ]eweller had done this, apprehension came upon him and he feared the issue of his affair and said to himself, ""As soon as the merchant learneth that I have killed them in his house, he will surely slay me; yet I beseech Allah that He appoint the taking of my life to be while I am in the True Belief!"" And he abode bewildered about his case and knew not what to do, but, as he was thus behold, in came Abd al-Rahman from his lurking place without the door and said to him, ""No harm shall befal thee, for indeed thou deserves"" safety. See this sword in my hand. 'Twas in my mind to slay thee, hadst thou made peace with her and restored her to favour, and I would also have slain her and the maid. But since thou hast done this deed, welcome to thee and again welcome! And I will reward thee by marrying thee to my daughter, Kamar al-Zaman's sister."" Then he carried him down and sent for the woman who washed the dead: whereupon it was bruited abroad that Kamar al-Zaman had brought with him two slave-girls from Bassorah and that both had deceased. So the people began to condole with him saying, ""May thy head live!"" and ""May Allah compensate thee!"" And they washed and shrouded them and buried them, and none knew the truth of the matter. Then Abd al-Rahman sent for the Shaykh al-Islam and all the notables and said, ""O Shaykh, draw up the contract of marriage between my daughter Kaukab al-Salah and Master Obayd the jeweller and set down that her dowry hath been paid to me in full."" So he wrote out the contract and Abd al-Rahman gave the company to drink of sherbets, and they made one wedding festival for the two brides the daughter of the Shaykh al-Islam and Kamar al-Zaman's sister; and paraded them in one litter on one and the same night; after which they carried Kamar al-Zaman and Obayd in procession together and brought them in to their brides. When the jeweller went in to Abd al-Rahman's daughter, he found her handsomer than Halimah and a thousand fold lovelier. So he took her maidenhead and on the morrow, he went to the Hammam with Kamar al-Zaman. Then he abode with them awhile in pleasance and joyance, after which he began to yearn for his native land; so he went in to Abd al-Rahman and said to him, ""O uncle, I long for my own country, for I have there estates and effects, which I left in charge of one of my prentices; and I am minded to journey thither that I may sell my properties and return to thee. So wilt thou give me leave to go to my country for that purpose?"" Answered the merchant, ""O my son, I give thee leave to do this and there be no fault in thee or blame to thee for these words, for 'Love of mother land is a part of Religion'; and he who hath not good in his own country hath none in other folks' country. But, haply, an thou depart without thy wife, when thou art once come to thy native place, it may seem good to thee to settle there, and thou wilt be perplexed between returning to thy wife and sojourning in thine own home; so it were the righter rede that thou carry thy wife with thee; and after, an thou desire to return to us, return and welcome to you both; for we are folk who know not divorce and no woman of us marrieth twice, nor do we lightly discard a man."" Quoth Obayd, ""Uncle, I fear me thy daughter will not consent to journey with me to my own country."" Replied Abd al-Rahman, ""O my son, we have no women amongst us who gainsay their spouses, nor know we a wife who is wroth with her man."" The jeweller cried, ""Allah bless you and your women!"" and going in to his wife, said to her, ""I am minded to go to my country: what sayst thou?"" Quoth she, ""Indeed, my sire had the ordering of me, whilst I was a maid, and when I married, the ordering all passed into the hands of my lord and master, nor will I gainsay him."" Quoth Obayd, ""Allah bless thee and thy father, and have mercy on the womb that bare thee and the loins that begat thee!"" Then he cut his thongs and applied himself to making ready for his journey. His father-in- law gave him much good and they took leave each of other, after which tile jeweller and his wife journeyed on without ceasing, till they reached Bassorah where his kinsmen and comrades came out to meet him, doubting not but that he had been in Al-Hijaz. Some rejoiced at his return, whilst others were vexed, and the folk said one to another, ""Now will he straiten us again every Friday, as before, and we shall be shut up in the mosques and houses, even to our cats and our dogs."" On such wise it fared with him; but as regards the King of Bassorah, when he heard of his return, he was wroth with him; and sending for him, upbraided him and said to him, ""Why didst thou depart, without letting me know of thy departure? Was I unable to give thee somewhat wherewith thou mightest have succoured thyself in thy pilgrimage to the Holy House of Allah?"" Replied the jeweller, ""Pardon, O my lord! By Allah, I went not on the pilgrimage! but there have befallen me such and such things."" Then he told him all that had befallen him with his wife and with Abd al-Rahman of Cairo and how the merchant had given him his daughter to wife, ending with these words, ""And I have brought her to Bassorah."" Said the King, ""By the Lord, did I not fear Allah the Most High, I would slay thee and marry this noble lady after thy death, though I spent on her mints of money, because she befitteth none but Kings. But Allah hath appointed her of thy portion and may He bless thee in her! So look thou use her well."" Then he bestowed largesse on the jeweller, who went out from before him and abode with his wife five years, after which he was admitted to the mercy of the Almighty. Presently the King sought his widow in wedlock; but she refused, saying, ""O King, never among my kindred was a woman who married again after her husband's death; wherefore I will never take another husband, nor will I marry thee, no, though thou kill me."" Then he sent to her one who said, ""Dost thou seek to go to thy native land?"" And she answered, ""An thou do good, thou shalt be requited therewith."" So he collected for her all the jeweller's wealth and added unto her of his own, after the measure of his degree. Lastly he sent with her one of his Wazirs, a man famous for goodness and piety, and an escort of five hundred horse, who journeyed with her, till they brought her to her father; and in his home she abode, without marrying again, till she died and they died all. So, if this woman would not consent to replace her dead husband with a Sultan, how shall she be compared with one who replaced her husband, whilst he was yet alive, with a youth of unknown extraction and condition, and especially when this was in lewd carriage and not by way of lawful marriage? So he who deemeth all women alike, there is no remedy for the disease of his insanity. And glory be to Him to whom belongeth the empire of the Seen and the Unseen and He is the Living, who dieth not! And among the tales they tell, O auspicious King, is one of

Footnotes:


 Lane rejects this tale because it is ""extremely objectionable; far more so than the title might lead me to expect."" But he quotes the following marginal note by his Shaykh: —""Many persons (women) reckon marrying a second time amongst the most disgraceful of actions. This opinion is commonest in the country-towns and villages; and my mother's relations are thus distinguished; so that a woman of them, when her husband dieth or divorceth her while she is young, passeth in widowhood her life, however long it may be, and disdaineth to marry a second time."" I fear that this state of things belongs to the good old days now utterly gone by; and the loose rule of the stranger, especially the English, in Egypt will renew the scenes which characterised Sind when Sir Charles Napier hanged every husband who cut down an adulterous wife. I have elsewhere noticed the ignorant idea that Moslems deny to women souls and seats in Paradise, whilst Mohammed canonised two women in his own family. The theory arose with the ""Fathers"" of the Christian Church who simply exaggerated the misogyny of St. Paul. St. Ambrose commenting on Corinthians i. ii., boldly says:—""Feminas ad imaginem Dei factas non esse."" St. Thomas Aquinas and his school adopted the Aristotelian view, ""Mulier est erratum naturae, et mas occasionatus, et per accidens generatur; atque ideo est monstrum."" For other instances see Bayle s. v. Gediacus (Revd. Simon of Brandebourg) who in 1695 published a ""Defensio Sexus muliebris,"" a refutation of an anti-Socinian satire or squib, ""Disputatio perjucunda, Mulieres homines non esse,"" Parisiis, 1693. But when Islam arose in the seventh century, the Christian learned cleverly affixed the stigma of their own misogyny upon the Moslems ad captandas foeminas and in Southern Europe the calumny still bears fruit. Mohammed (Koran, chapt. xxiv.) commands for the first time, in the sixth year of his mission, the veiling and, by inference, the seclusion of women, which was apparently unknown to the Badawin and, if practised in the cities was probably of the laxest. Nor can one but confess that such modified separation of the sexes, which it would be impossible to introduce into European manners, has great and notable advantages. It promotes the freest intercourse between man and man, and thus civilises what we call the ""lower orders"": in no Moslem land, from Morocco to China, do we find the brutals without manners or morals which are bred by European and especially by English civilisation. For the same reason it enables women to enjoy fullest intimacy and friendship with one another, and we know that the best of both sexes are those who prefer the society of their own as opposed to ""quite the lady's man"" and ""quite the gentleman's woman."" It also adds an important item to social decorum by abolishing e.g. such indecencies as the ""ball-room flirtation""—a word which must be borrowed from us, not translated by foreigners. And especially it gives to religious meetings, a tone which the presence of women modifies and not for the better. Perhaps, the best form is that semiseclusion of the sex, which prevailed in the heroic ages of Greece, Rome, and India (before the Moslem invasion), and which is perpetuated in Christian Armenia and in modern Hellas. It is a something between the conventual strictness of Al-Islam and the liberty, or rather licence, of the ""Anglo-Saxon"" and the ""Anglo-American."" And when England shall have cast off that peculiar insularity which makes her differ from all civilised peoples, she will probably abolish three gross abuses, time-honoured scandals, which bear very heavily on women and children. The first is the Briton's right to will property away from his wife and offspring. The second is the action for ""breach of promise,"" salving the broken heart with pounds, shillings, and pence: it should be treated simply as an exaggerated breach of contract. The third is the procedure popularly called ""Crim. Con.,"" and this is the most scandalous of all: the offence is against the rights of property, like robbery or burglary, and it ought to be treated criminally with fine, imprisonment and in cases with corporal punishment after the sensible procedure of Moslem law.
 ""Moon of the age,"" a name which has before occurred.
 The Malocchio or gettatura, so often noticed.
 The crescent of the month Zu 'l-Ka'dah when the Ramazan-fast is broken. This allusion is common. Comp. vol. i. 84.
 This line contains one of the Yes, Yes and No, No trifles alluded to in vol. ii, 60. Captain Lockett (M. A. 103) renders it ""I saw a fawn upon a hillock whose beauty eclipsed the full moon. I said, What is thy name? she answered Deer. What my Dear said I, but she replied, no, no!"" To preserve the sound I have sacrificed sense: Lulu is a pearl, Li? li? (= for me, for me?) and La! La! = no! no! See vol. i, 217. I should have explained a line which has puzzled some readers,
""A sun (face) on wand (neck) in knoll of sand (hips) she showed"" etc,
 Arab. ""Al-huwayna,"" a rare term.
 Bright in the eyes of the famishing who is allowed to break his fast.
 Mr. Payne reads ""Maghrabi"" = a Mauritanian, Maroccan, the Moors (not the Moorish Jews or Arabs) being a race of Sodomites from highest to lowest. But the Mac. and Bul. Edit. have ""Ajami.""
 For ""Ishk uzri"" = platonic love see vol. i. 232; ii. 104.
 Zaynab (Zenobia) and Zayd are generic names for women and men.
 i.e. He wrote ""Kasidahs"" (= odes, elegies) after the fashion of the ""Suspended Poems"" which mostly open with the lover gazing upon the traces of the camp where his beloved had dwelt. The exaggerated conventionalism of such exordium shows that these early poems had been preceded by a host of earlier pieces which had been adopted as canons of poetry.
 The verses are very mal-a-propos, like many occurring in The Nights, for the maligned Shaykh is proof against all the seductions of the pretty boy and falls in love with a woman after the fashion of Don Quixote. Mr. Payne complains of the obscurity of the original owing to abuse of the figure enallage; but I find them explicit enough, referring to some debauched elder after the type of Abu Nowas.
 Arab. ""'Irk"" = a root which must here mean a sprig, a twig. The basil grows to a comparatively large size in the East.
 Arab. ""Lait ""= one connected with the tribe of Lot, see vol. v. 161.
 For the play upon ""Saki"" (oblique case of sak, leg-calf) and Saki a cupbearer see vol. ii. 327.
 ""On a certain day the leg shall be bared and men shall be called upon to bow in adoration, but they shall not be able"" (Koran, lxviii. 42). ""Baring the leg"" implies a grievous calamity, probably borrowed from the notion of tucking up the skirts and stripping for flight. On the dangerous San Francisco River one of the rapids is called ""Tira-calcoens"" = take off your trousers (Highlands of the Brazil, ii. 35). But here the allusion is simply ludicrous and to a Moslem blasphemous.
 Arab. ""Istahi,"" a word of every day use in reproof. So the Hindost. ""Kuchh sharm nahin?"" hast thou no shame? Shame is a passion with Orientals and very little known to the West.
 i.e. Angels and men saying, ""The Peace (of God) be on us and on all righteous servants of Allah!"" This ends every prayer.
 Arab. ""Al-Niyah,"" the ceremonial purpose or intent to pray, without which prayer is null and void. See vol. v. 163. The words would be ""I purpose to pray a two-bow prayer in this hour of deadly danger to my soul."" Concerning such prayer see vol. i. 142.
 Arab. ""Sakin"" = quiescent, Let a sleeping hound lie.
 Arab. ""Asar"" lit. traces i.e. the works, the mighty signs and marvels.
 The mention of coffee now frequently occurs in this tale and in that which follows: the familiar use of it showing a comparatively late date, and not suggesting the copyist's hand.
 Arab. ""Al-Kahwah,"" the place being called from its produce. See Pilgrimage i. 317-18.
 Arab. ""Al-Ghurbah Kurbah:"" the translation in the text is taken from my late friend Edward Eastwick, translator of the Gulistan and author of a host of works which show him to have been a ripe Oriental scholar.
 The fiction may have been suggested by the fact that in all Moslem cities from India to Barbary the inner and outer gates are carefully shut during the noontide devotions, not ""because Friday is the day on which creation was finished and Mohammed entered Al-Medinah;"" but because there is a popular idea that in times now approaching the Christians will rise up against the Moslems during prayers and will repeat the ""Sicilian Vespers.""
 i.e. the syndic of the Guild of Jewellers.
 This is an Arab Lady Godiva of the wrong sort.
 This is explained in my Pilgrimage i. 99 et seq.
 About three pennyweights. It varies, however, everywhere and in Morocco the ""Mezkal"" as they call it is an imaginary value, no such coin existing.
 i.e. over and above the value of the gold, etc.
 This was the custom of contemporary Europe and more than one master cutler has put to death an apprentice playing Peeping Tom to detect the secret of sword-making.
 Among Moslems husbands are divided into three species; (1) of ""Bahr"" who is married for love; (2) of ""Dahr,"" for defence against the world, and (3) of ""Mahr"" for marriage-settlements (money). Master Obayd was an unhappy compound of the two latter; but he did not cease to be a man of honour.
The Mac. Edit. here is a mass of blunders and misprints.
 The Mac. Edit. everywhere calls her ""Sabiyah"" = the young lady and does not mention her name Halimah = the Mild, the Gentle till the cmlxxivth Night. I follow Mr. Payne's example by introducing it earlier into the story, as it avoids vagueness and repetition of the indefinite.
 Arab ""Adím al-Zauk,""=without savour. applied to an insipid mannerless man as ""bárid"" (cold) is to a fool. ""Ahl Zauk"" is a man of pleasure, a voluptuary, a hedonist.
 Arab. ""Finján"" the egg-shell cups from which the
Easterns still drink coffee.
 Arab. ""Awáshik"" a rare word, which Dozy translates ""osselet"" (or osselle) and Mr. Payne, ""hucklebones,"" concerning which he has obliged me with this note. Chambaud renders osselet by ""petit os avec lequel les enfants jouent."" Hucklebone is the hip-bone but in the plural it applies to our cockals or cockles: Latham gives ""hucklebone,"" (or cockal), one of the small vertebræ of the coccygis, and Littleton translates ""Talus,"" a hucklebone, a bone to play with like a dye, a play called cockal. (So also in Rider.) Hucklebones and knucklebones are syn.: but the latter is modern and liable to give a false idea, besides being tautological. It has nothing to do with the knuckles and derives from the German ""Knochel"" (dialectically Knochelein) a bonelet.
 For ablution after sleep and before prayer. The address of the slave-girl is perfectly natural: in a Moslem house we should hear it this day, nor does it show the least sign of ""frowardness. ""
 The perfect stupidity of the old wittol is told with the driest Arab humour.
 This is a rechauffé of the Language of Signs in ""Azíz and Azízah"" vol. ii. 302.
 In the Mac. Edit. ""Yá Fulánah""=O certain person.
 Arab. ""Laylat al-Kábilah,"" lit.=the coming night, our to-night; for which see vol. iii. 349.
 Arab. ""Ya Ahmak!"" which in Marocco means a madman, a maniac, a Santon.
 The whole passage has a grammatical double entendre whose application is palpable. Harf al-Jarr=a particle governing the noun in the genitive or a mode of thrusting and tumbling.
 Arab. ""Al-Silah"" =conjunctive (sentence), also coition; Al-Mausúl= the conjoined, a grammatical term for relative pronoun or particle.
 Arab. ""Tanwin al-Izafah ma'zul"" = the nunnation in construction cast out. ""Tanwin"" (nunnation) is pronouncing the vowels of the case-endings of a noun with n un for u (nominative) in for i (genitive) and an for a (accusative). This nunnation expresses indefiniteness, e.g. ""Malikun""=a king, any king. When the noun is made definite by the Ma'rifah or article (al), the Tanwin must be dropped, e.g. Al-Maliku = the King; Al- Malikun being a grammatical absurdity. In construction or regimen (izafah) the nunnation must also disappear, as Maliku 'I-Hind) = the King of Hind (a King of Hind would be Malikun min Muluki 'I-Hind) = a King from amongst the Kings of Hind). Thus whilst the wife and the lover were conjoined as much as might be, the hocussed and sleeping husband was dismissed (ma'zul=degraded) like a nunnation dropped in construction. I may add that the terminal syllables are invariably dropped in popular parlance and none but Mr. G. Palgrave (who afterwards ignored his own assertion) ever found an Arab tribe actually using them in conversation although they are always pronounced when reading the Koran and poetry.
 This was a saying of Mohammed about overfrequency of visits, ""Zur ghibban, tazid hubban""=call rarely that friendship last fairly. So the verse of Al-Mutanabbi,
""How oft familiarity breeds dislike.""
Preston quotes Jesus ben Sirach, {Greek}. Also Al-Hariri (Ass. xv. of ""The Legal""; De Sacy p. 478 1. 2.) ""Visit not your friend more than one day in a month, nor stop longer than that with him!"" Also Ass. xvi. 487, 8. ""Multiply not visits to thy friend."" ""None so disliked as one visiting too often."" (Preston p. 352). In the Cent nouvelles (52) Nouvelles (No. lii.) the dying father says to his son:—""Jamais ne vous hantez tent en l'ostel de votre voisin que lion vous y serve de pain bis."" In these matters Moslems follow the preaching and practice of the Apostle, who was about as hearty and genial as the ""Great Washington."" But the Arab had a fund of dry humour which the Anglo-American lacked altogether.
 Arab. ""'Amal""—action, operation. In Hindostani it is used (often with an Alif for an Ayn) as intoxication e.g. Amal pání strong waters and applied to Sharáb (wine), Bozah (Beer), Tádí (toddy or the fermented juice of the Tád, Borassus flabelliformis), Naryáli (juice of the cocoa-nut tree) Saynddi (of the wild date, Elate Sylvestris), Afyún (opium an its preparations as post=poppy seeds) and various forms of Cannabis Sativa, as Ganja, Charas, Madad, Sahzi etc. for which see Herklots' Glossary.
 Arab ""Sardáb,"" mostly an underground room (vol. i. 340) but here a tunnel.
 Arab. ""Al-Láwandiyah"": this and the frequent mention of coffee and presently of a watch (sa'ah) show that the tale in its present state, cannot be older than the end of the sixteenth century.
 Arab. ""Su'bán,"" vol. i. 172.
 The lines have occurred in vol. i. 238, where I have noted the punning ""Sabr""= patience or aloes. I quote Torrens: the Templar, however, utterly abolishes the pun in the last couplet:- -
""The case is not at my command, but in fair Patience hand
I'm set by Him who order'th all and cloth such case command.""
""Amr"" here=case (circumstance) or command (order) with a suspicion of reference to Murr=myrrh, bitterness. The reader will note the resignation to Fate's decrees which here and in host of places elevates the tone of the book.
 i.e. as one loathes that which is prohibited, and with a loathing which makes it unlawful for me to cohabit with thee.
 This is quite natural to the sensitive Eastern.
 Hence, according to Moslem and Eastern theory generally her lewd and treasonable conduct. But in Egypt not a few freeborn women and those too of the noblest, would beat her hollow at her own little game. See for instance the booklet attributed to Jalál al-Siyútí and entitled Kitáh al-Ízáh (Book of Explanation) fí Ilm al-Nikáh (in the Science of Carnal Copulation). There is a copy of it in the British Museum; and a friend kindly suppl~ed me with a lithograph from Cairo; warning me that there are doubts about the authorship.
 These lines have occurred in vol. iii. 214: I quote Mr.
Payne.
 This ejaculation, as the waw shows, is parenthetic; spoken either by Halimah, by Shahrazad or by the writer.
 Arab. ""Kasr"" here meaning an upper room.
 To avoid saying, I pardon thee.
 A proverbial saying which here means I could only dream of such good luck.
 A good old custom amongst Moslems who have had business transactions with each other: such acquittance of all possible claims will be quoted on ""Judgment-Day,"" when debts will be severely enquired into.
 Arab. ""Kutr (tract or quarter) Misr,"" vulgarly pronounced ""Masr."" I may remind the reader that the Assyrians called the Nile-valley ""Musur"" whence probably the Heb. Misraim a dual form denoting Upper and Lower Egypt which are still distinguished by the Arabs into Sa'id and Misr. The hieroglyphic term is Ta-mera=Land of the Flood; and the Greek Aigyptos is probably derived from Kahi-Ptah (region of the great God Ptah) or Ma Ka Ptah (House of the soul of Ptah). The word ""Cops"" or ""Kopt,"" in Egyptian ""Kubti"" and pronounced ""Gubti,"" contains the same consonants
 Now an unimportant frontier fort and village dividing Syria-Palestine from Egypt and famed for the French battle with the Mamelukes (Feb. 19, 1799) and the convention for evacuating Egypt. In the old times it was an important site built upon the ""River of Egypt"" now a dried up Wady; and it was the chief port of the then populous Najab or South Country. According to Abulfeda it derived its name (the ""boothy,"" the nest) from a hut built there by the brothers of Joseph when stopped at the frontier by the guards of Pharaoh. But this is usual Jewish infection of history.
 Arab. ""Báb."" which may also=""Chapter"" or category. See vol. i., 136 and elsewhere (index). In Egypt ""Báb"" sometimes means a sepulchral cave hewn in a rock (plur. Bíbán) from the Coptic ""Bíb.""
 i.e. ""The Holy,"" a town some three marches (60 miles) N. East of Cairo; thus showing the honour done to our unheroic hero. There is also a Sálihlyah quarter or suburb of Damascus famous for its cemetery of holy men, but the facetious Cits change the name to Zálliniyah=causing to stray; in allusion to its Kurdish population. Baron von Hammer reads ""le faubourg Adelieh"" built by Al-Malik Al-Adil and founded a chronological argument on a clerical error.
 Kamar al-Zaman; the normal pun on the name; a practice as popular in the East as in the West, and worthy only of a pickpocket in either place.
 Arab. ""Azrár"" plur. of ""Zirr"" and lit. = 'buttons,"" i.e. of his robe collar from which his white neck and face appear shining as the sun.
 Arab. ""Dáirah"" the usual inclosure of Kanáts or tent-flaps pitched for privacy during the halt.
 i.e. it was so richly ornamented that it resembled an enchanted hoard whose spells, hiding it from sight, had been broken by some happy treasure seeker.
 The merchant who is a ""stern parent"" and exceedingly ticklish on the Pundonor saw at first sight her servile origin which had escaped the mother. Usually it is the other way.
 Not the head of the Church, or Chief Pontiff, but the Chief of the Olema and Fukahá (Fákihs or D.D.'s.) men learned in the Law (divinity). The order is peculiarly Moslem, in fact the succedaneum for the Christian ""hierarchy "" an institution never contemplated by the Founder of Christianity. This title shows the modern date of the tale.
 Arab. ""Maulid,"" prop. applied to the Birth-feast of Mohammed which begins on the 3rd day of Rabí al-Awwal (third Moslem month) and lasts a week or ten days (according to local custom), usually ending on the 12th and celebrated with salutes of cannon, circumcision feasts. marriage banquets. Zikr-litanies, perfections of the Koran and all manner of solemn festivities including the ""powder-play"" (Láb al-Bárút) in the wilder corners of Al-Islam. It is also applied to the birth-festivals of great Santons (as Ahmad al- Badawi) for which see Lane M. E. chaps. xxiv. In the text it is used like the Span. ""Funcion"" or the Hind ""Tamáshá,"" any great occasion of merry-making.
 Arab. ""Sanájik"" Plur. of Sanjak (Turk.) = a banner, also applied to the bearer (ensign or cornet) and to a military rank mostly corresponding with Bey or Colonel.
 I have followed Mr. Payne's ordering of the text which, both in the Mac. and Bull. Edits., is wholly inconsequent and has not the excuse of rhyme.
 Arab. ""Jilbáb,"" a long coarse veil or gown which in Barbary becomes a ""Jallábiyah,"" in a striped and hooded cloak of woollen stuff.
 i.e. a broken down pilgrim left to die on the road.
 These lines have occurred in vol. i. 272. I quote Mr.
Payne.
 Note the difference between ""Zirt,"" the loud crepitus
and ""Faswah"" the susurrus which Captain Grose in his quaint
""Lexicum Balatronicum,"" calls a ""fice"" or a ""foyse"" (from the
Arabic Fas, faswah ?).
 These lines have occurred in Night dcxix, vol. vi. 246; where the pun on Khaliyah is explained. I quote Lane.
 The usual pretext of ""God bizness,"" as the Comoro men call it. For the title of the Ka'abah see my Pilgrimage vol. iii. 149.
 This was in order to travel as a respectable man, he could also send the girl as a spy into the different Harims to learn news of the lady who had eloped.
 A polite form of alluding to their cursing him.
 i.e. on account of the King taking offence at his unceremonious departure.
 i.e. It will be the worse for him.
 I would here remind the reader that ""'Arabiyyun"" pl. 'Urb is a man of pure Arab race, whether of the Ahl al-Madar (=people of mortar, i.e. citizens) or Ahl al-Wabar (=tents of goat or camel's hair); whereas ""A'rábiyyun"" pl. A'ráb is one who dwells in the Desert whether Arab or not. Hence the verse:—
""They name us Al-A'ráb but Al-'Urb is our name.""
 I would remind the reader that the Dinár is the golden denarius (or solidus) of Eastern Rome while the Dirham is the silver denarius, whence denier, danaro, dínheiro, etc., etc. The oldest diners date from A.H. 91-92 (=714-15) and we find the following description of one struck in A.H. 96 by Al-Walid the VI. Ommiade:—
Obverse:
Area. ""There is no iláh but Allah: He is one: He hath no

Reverse:
Area. ""Allah is one: Allah is Eternal: He begetteth not,
nor is He begot.""
Circle. ""Bismillah: This Dinar was struck anno 96.""
See ""'Ilâm-en-Nas"" (warnings for Folk) a pleasant little volume by Mr. Godfrey Clarke (London, King and Co., 1873), mostly consisting of the minor tales from The Nights especially this group between Nights ccxlvii. and cdlxi.; but rendered valuable by the annotations of my old friend, the late Frederick Ayrton.
 The reader will note the persistency with which the duty of universal benevolence is preached.
 Arab. from Pers. ""Shah-bander"": see vol. iv. 29.
 i.e. of thy coming, a popular compliment.
 This is the doctrine of the universal East; and it is true concerning wives and widows, not girls when innocent or rather ignorant. According to Western ideas Kamar al-Zaman was a young scoundrel of the darkest dye whose only excuses were his age, his inexperience and his passions.
 Arab. ""Dayyús"" prop. = a man who pimps for his own wife and in this sense constantly occurring in conversation.
 This is taking the law into one's own hands with a witness, yet amongst races who preserve the Pundonor in full and pristine force, e.g. the Afghans and the Persian Iliyat, the killing so far from being considered murder or even justifiable homicide would be highly commended by public opinion.
 Arab. ""Nákisátu'aklin wa dín"": the words are attributed to the Prophet whom we find saying, ""Verily in your wives and children ye have an enemy, wherefore beware of them"" (Koran lxiv. 14): compare 1 Cor. vii. 28, 32. But Maître Jehan de Meung went farther,
""Toutes êtez, serez ou fûses
De faict ou de volonté, putes.""
 Arab. ""Habíbí wa tabíbí,"" the common jingle.
 Iblis and his connection with Diabolos has been noticed in vol. i. 13. The word is foreign as well as a P.N. and therefore is imperfectly declined, although some authorities deduce it from ""ablasa""=he despaired (of Allah's mercy). Others call him Al-Háris (the Lion) hence Eve's first-born was named in his honour Abd al-Harts. His angelic name was Azázíl before he sinned by refusing to prostrate himself to Adam, as Allah had commanded the heavenly host for a trial of faith, not to worship the first man, but to make him a Keblah or direction of prayer addressed to the Almighty. Hence he was ejected from Heaven and became the arch enemy of mankind (Koran xviii. 48). He was an angel but related to the Jinn: Al-Bayzáwi, however (on Koran ii. 82), opines that angelic by nature he became a Jinn by act. Ibn Abbas held that he belonged to an order of angels who are called Jinn and begot issue as do the nasnás, the Ghúl and the Kutrub which, however are male and female, like the pre-Adamite manwoman of Genesis, the ""bi-une"" of our modern days. For this subject see Terminal Essay.
 As usual in the East and in the West the husband was the last to hear of his wife's ill conduct. But even Othello did not kill Emilia.
 i.e. Star of the Morning: the first word occurs in Bar
Cokba Barchocheba=Son of the Star, i.e., which was to come out of
Jacob (Numbers xxiv. 17). The root, which does not occur in Heb.,

Son of the Lie.
 Here some excision has been judged advisable as the names of the bridegrooms and the brides recur with damnable iteration.
 See the note by Lane's Shaykh at the beginning of the tale. The contrast between the vicious wife of servile origin and the virtuous wife of noble birth is fondly dwelt upon but not exaggerated.
 i.e. those of his water skins for the journey, which as usual required patching and supplying with fresh handles after long lying dry.
 A popular saying also applied to men. It is usually accompanied with showing the open hand and a reference to the size of the fingers. I find this story most interesting from an anthropological point of view; suggesting how differently various races regard the subject of adultery. In Northern Europe the burden is thrown most unjustly upon the man, the woman who tempts him being a secondary consideration; and in England he is absurdly termed ""a seducer."" In former times he was ""paraded"" or ""called out,"" now he is called up for damages, a truly ignoble and shopkeeper-like mode of treating a high offence against private property and public morality. In Anglo-America, where English feeling is exaggerated, the lover is revolver'd and the woman is left unpunished. On the other hand, amongst Eastern and especially Moslem peoples, the woman is cut down and scant reckoning is taken from the man. This more sensible procedure has struck firm root amongst the nations of Southern Europe where the husband kills the lover only when he still loves his wife and lover like is furious at her affection being alienated.
Practically throughout the civilised world there are only two ways of treating women, Moslems keep them close, defend them from all kinds of temptations and if they go wrong kill them. Christians place them upon a pedestal, the observed of all observers, expose them to every danger and if they fall, accuse and abuse them instead of themselves. And England is so grandly logical that her law, under certain circumstances, holds that Mrs. A. has committed adultery with Mr. B. but Mr. B. has not committed adultery with Mrs. A. Can any absurdity be more absurd? Only ""summum jus, summa injuria."" See my Terminal Essay. I shall have more to say upon this curious subject, the treatment of women who can be thoroughly guarded only by two things, firstly their hearts and secondly by the ""Spanish Padlock.""Embed","1 ContributorArabian Nights, Vol. 9 (Chap. 10) LyricsKamar Al-Zaman and the Jeweller's Wife

There was once, in time of old, a merchant hight Abd al-Rahmán, whom Allah had blessed with a son and daughter, and for their much beauty and loveliness, he named the girl Kaubab al-Sabáh and the boy Kamar al-Zamán. When he saw what Allah had vouchsafed the twain of beauty and loveliness, brilliancy and symmetry, he feared for them the evil eyes of the espiers and the jibing tongues of the jealous and the craft of the crafty and the wiles of the wicked and shut them up from the folk in a mansion for the space of fourteen years, during which time none saw them save their parents and a slave-girl who served them. Now their father could recite the Koran, even as Allah sent it down, as also did his wife, wherefore the mother taught her daughter to read and recite it and the father his son till both had gotten it by heart. Moreover, the twain learned from their parents writing and reckoning and all manner of knowledge and polite letters and needed no master. When Kamar al-Zaman came to years of manhood, the wife said to her husband, ""How long wilt thou keep thy son Kamar al-Zaman sequestered from the eyes of the folk? Is he a girl or a boy?"" He answered, ""A boy."" Rejoined she, ""An he be a boy, why dost thou not carry him to the bazar and seat him in thy shop, that he may know the folk and they know him, to the intent that it may become notorious among men that he is thy son, and do thou teach him to sell and to buy. Peradventure somewhat may befal thee; so shall the folk know him for thy son and he shall lay his hand on thy leavings. But, an thou die, as the case now is, and he say to the folk, 'I am the son of the merchant Abd al-Rahman,' verily they will not believe him, but will cry, 'We have never seen thee and we knew not that he had a son,' wherefore the government will seize thy goods and thy son will be despoiled. In like manner the girl; I mean to make her known among the folk, so may be some one of her own condition may ask her in marriage and we will wed her to him and rejoice in her."" Quoth he, ""I did thus of my fear for them from the eyes of the folk,""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Nine Hundred and Sixty-fourth Night,
She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Merchant's wife spake to him in such wise, he replied, ""I did thus of my fear for them from the eyes of the folk and because I love them both and love is jealous exceedingly and well saith he who spoke these verses,
'Of my sight I am jealous for thee, of me, * Of thyself, of thy
            stead, of thy destiny:
Though I shrined thee in eyes by the craze of me * In such
             nearness irk I should never see:
Though thou wert by my side all the days of me * Till Doomsday I
             ne'er had enough of thee.'""
Said his wife, ""Put thy trust in Allah, for no harm betideth him whom He protecteth, and carry him with thee this very day to the shop."" Then she clad the boy in the costliest clothes and he became a seduction to all who on him cast sight and an affliction to the heart of each lover wight. His father took him and carried him to the market, whilst all who saw him were ravished with him and accosted him, kissing his hand and saluting him with the salam. Quoth one, ""Indeed the sun hath risen in such a place and blazeth in the bazar,"" and another, ""The rising-place of the full moon is in such a quarter;"" and a third, ""The new moon of the Festival hath appeared to the creatures of Allah."" And they went on to allude to the boy in talk and call down blessings upon him. But his father scolded the folk for following his son to gaze upon him, because he was abashed at their talk, but he could not hinder one of them from talking; so he fell to abusing the boy's mother and cursing her because she had been the cause of his bringing him out. And as he gazed about he still saw the folk crowding upon him behind and before. Then he walked on till he reached his shop and opening it, sat down and seated his son before him: after which he again looked out and found the thoroughfare blocked with people for all the passers-by, going and coming, stopped before the shop to stare at that beautiful face and could not leave him; and all the men and women crowded in knots about him, applying to themselves the words of him who said,
""Thou madest Beauty to spoil man's sprite * And saidst, 'O my
           servants, fear My reprove:'
But lovely Thou lovest all loveliness * How, then, shall thy
            servants refrain from Love?""
When the merchant Abd al-Rahman saw the folk thus crowding about him and standing in rows, both women and men, to fix eyes upon his son, he was sore ashamed and confounded and knew not what to do; but presently there came up from the end of the bazar a man of the wandering Dervishes, clad in haircloth, the garb of the pious servants of Allah and seeing Kamar al-Zaman sitting there as he were a branch of Bán springing from a mound of saffron, poured forth copious tears and recited these two couplets,
""A wand uprising from a sandy knoll, * Like full moon shining
            brightest sheen, I saw;
And said, 'What is thy name?' Replied he 'Lúlú' * 'What' (asked
            I) 'Lily?' and he answered 'Lá, lá!'""
Then the Dervish fell to walking, now drawing near and now moving away, and wiping his gray hairs with his right hand, whilst the heart of the crowd was cloven asunder for awe of him. When he looked upon the boy, his eyes were dazzled and his wit confounded, and exemplified in him was the saying of the poet,
""While that fair-faced boy abode in the place, * Moon of
             breakfast-fête he lit by his face,
Lo! there came a Shaykh with leisurely pace * A reverend trusting
             to Allah's grace,
                          And ascetic signals his gait display'd.
He had studied Love both by day and night * And had special
             knowledge of Wrong and Right;
Both for lad and lass had repined his sprite, * And his form like
            toothpick was lean and slight,
                          And old bones with faded skin were o'erlaid.
In such arts our Shaykh was an Ajamí * With a catamite
             ever in company;
In the love of woman, a Platonist he * But in either
            versed to the full degree,
                         And Zaynab to him was the same as Zayd.
Distraught by the Fair he adored the Fair * O'er Spring-camp
           wailed, bewept ruins bare.
Dry branch thou hadst deemed him for stress o' care, * Which the
            morning breeze swayeth here and there,
                         For only the stone is all hardness made!
In the lore of Love he was wondrous wise * And wide awake with
            all-seeing eyes.
Its rough and its smooth he had tried and tries * And hugged buck
            and doe in the self-same guise
                          And with greybeard and beardless alike he
play'd.""
Then he came up to the boy and gave him a root of sweet basil, whereupon his father put forth his hand to his pouch and brought out for him some small matter of silver, saying, ""Take thy portion, O Dervish, and wend thy ways."" He took the dirhams, but sat down on the masonry-bench alongside the shop and opposite the boy and fell to gazing upon him and heaving sigh upon sigh, whilst his tears flowed like springs founting. The folk began to look at him and remark upon him, some saying, ""All Dervishes are lewd fellows,"" and other some, ""Verily, this Dervish's heart is set on fire for love of this lad."" Now when Abd al-Rahman saw this case, he arose and said to the boy, ""Come, O my son, let us lock up the shop and hie us home, for it booteth not to sell and buy this day; and may Almighty Allah requite thy mother that which she hath done with us, for she was the cause of all this!"" Then said he, ""O Dervish, rise, that I may shut my shop."" So the Dervish rose and the merchant shut his shop and taking his son, walked away. The Dervish and the folk followed them, till they reached their place, when the boy went in and his father, turning to the Dervish, said to him, ""What wouldst thou, O Dervish, and why do I see thee weep?"" He replied, ""O my lord, I would fain be thy guest this night, for the guest is the guest of Almighty Allah."" Quoth the merchant, ""Welcome to the guest of God: enter, O Dervish!""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Nine Hundred and Sixty-fifth Night,
She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the merchant, the father of Kamar al-Zaman, heard the saying of the Dervish, ""I am Allah's guest,"" he replied, ""Welcome to the guest of God: enter, O Dervish!"" But he said to himself, ""An the beggar be enamoured of the boy and sue him for sin, needs must I slay him this very night and bury him secretly. But, an there be no lewdness in him, the guest shall eat his portion."" Then he brought him into a saloon, where he left him with Kamar al-Zaman, after he had said privily to the lad, ""O my son, sit thou beside the Dervish when I am gone out and sport with him and provoke him to love-liesse and if he seek of thee lewdness, I who will be watching you from the window overlooking the saloon will come down to him and kill him."" So, as soon as Kamar al-Zaman was alone in the room with the Dervish, he sat down by his side and the old man began to look upon him and sigh and weep. Whenever the lad bespake him, he answered him kindly, trembling the while and would turn to him groaning and crying, and thus he did till supper was brought in, when he fell to eating, with his eyes on the boy but refrained not from shedding tears. When a fourth part of the night was past and talk was ended and sleep-tide came, Abd al-Rahman said to the lad, ""O my son, apply thyself to the service of thine uncle the Dervish and gainsay him not:"" and would have gone out; but the Dervish cried to him, ""O my lord, carry thy son with thee or sleep with us."" Answered the merchant, ""Nay, my son shall lie with thee: haply thy soul may desire somewhat, and he will look to thy want and wait upon thee."" Then he went out leaving them both together, and sat down in an adjoining room which had a window giving upon the saloon. Such was the case with the merchant; but as to the lad, as soon as his sire had left them, he came up to the Dervish and began to provoke him and offer himself to him, whereupon he waxed wroth and said, ""What talk is this, O my son? I take refuge with Allah from Satan the Stoned! O my Lord, indeed this is a denial of Thee which pleaseth Thee not! Avaunt from me, O my son!"" So saying, the Dervish arose and sat down at a distance; but the boy followed him and threw himself upon him, saying, ""Why, O Dervish, wilt thou deny thyself the joys of my possession, and I with a heart that loveth thee?"" Hereupon the Dervish's anger redoubled and he said, ""An thou refrain not from me, I will summon thy sire and tell him of thy doings."" Quoth the lad, ""My father knoweth my turn for this and it may not be that he will hinder me: so heal thou my heart. Why dost thou hold off from me? Do I not please thee?"" Answered the Dervish, ""By Allah, O my son, I will not do this, though I be hewn in pieces with sharp-edged swords!""; and he repeated the saying of the poet,
""Indeed my heart loves all the lovely boys * As girls; nor am I
             slow to such delight,
But, though I sight them every night and morn, * I'm neither of
            Lot's folk nor wencher-wight.""
Then he shed tears and said, ""Arise, open the door, that I may wend my way, for I will lie no longer in this lodging."" Therewith he rose to his feet; but the boy caught hold of him, saying, ""Look at the fairness of my face and the cramoisy of my cheeks and the softness of my sides and the lusciousness of my lips."" Moreover he discovered to him calves that would shame wine and cupcarrier and gazed on him with fixed glance that would baffle enchanter and enchantments; for he was passing of loveliness and full of blandishment, even as saith of him one of the poets who sang,
""I can't forget him, since he rose and showed with fair design *
          Those calves of legs whose pearly shine make light in
            nightly gloom:
Wonder not an my flesh uprise as though 'twere Judgment-day *
             When every shank shall bared be and that is Day of
             Doom.""
Then the boy displayed to him his bosom, saying, ""Look at my breasts which be goodlier than the breasts of maidens and my lip-dews are sweeter than sugar-candy. So quit scruple and asceticism and cast off devoutness and abstinence and take thy fill of my possession and enjoy my loveliness. Fear naught, for thou art safe from hurt, and leave this hebetude for 'tis a bad habit."" And he went on to discover to him his hidden beauties, striving to turn the reins of his reason with his bendings in graceful guise, whilst the Dervish turned away his face and said, ""I seek refuge with Allah! Have some shame, O my son! This is a forbidden thing I deem and I will not do it, no, not even in dream."" The boy pressed upon him, but the Dervish got free from him and turning towards Meccah addressed himself to his devotions. Now when the boy saw him praying, he left him till he had prayed a two-bow prayer and saluted, when he would have accosted him again; but the Dervish again repeated the intent and prayed a second two-bow prayer, and thus he did a third and a fourth and a fifth time. Quoth the lad, ""What prayers are these? Art thou minded to take flight upon the clouds? Thou lettest slip our delight, whilst thou passest the whole night in the prayer-niche."" So saying, he threw himself upon the Dervish and kissed him between the eyes; but the Shaykh said, ""O my son, put Satan away from thine estate and take upon thee obedience of the Compassionate."" Quoth the other, ""An thou do not with me that which I desire, I will call my sire and say to him, The Dervish is minded to do lewdness with me. Whereupon he will come in to thee and beat thee till thy bones be broken upon thy flesh."" All this while Abd al-Rahman was watching with his eyes and hearkening with his ears, and he was certified that there was no frowardness in the Dervish and he said to himself, ""Were he a lewd fellow, he had not stood out against all this importunity."" The boy continued to beguile the Dervish and every time he expressed purpose of prayer, he interrupted him, till at last he waxed wroth with passing wrath and was rough with him and beat him. Kamar al-Zaman wept and his father came in and having wiped away his tears and comforted him said to the Dervish, ""O my brother, since thou art in such case, why didst thou weep and sigh when thou sawest my son? Say me, is there a reason for this?"" He replied, ""There is;"" and Abd al-Rahman pursued, ""When I saw thee weep at his sight, I deemed evil of thee and bade the boy do with thee thus, that I might try thee, purposing in myself, if I saw thee sue him for sin, to come in upon thee and kill thee. But, when I saw what thou didst, I knew thee for one of those who are virtuous to the end. Now Allah upon thee, tell me the cause of thy weeping!"" The Dervish sighed and said, ""O my lord, chafe not a closed wound."" But the merchant said, ""There is no help but thou tell me;"" and the other began, ""Know thou that I am a Dervish who wander in the lands and the countries, and take warning by the display of the Creator of Night and Day. It chanced that one Friday I entered the city of Bassorah in the undurn.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Nine Hundred and Sixty-sixth Night,
She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Dervish said to the merchant, ""Know, then, that I a wandering mendicant chanced one Friday to enter the city of Bassorah in the undurn and saw the shops open and full of all manner of wares and meat and drink; but the place was deserted and therein was neither man nor woman nor girl nor boy: nor in the markets and the main streets was there dog or cat nor sounded sound nor friend was found. I marvelled at this end and said to myself, 'I wonder whither the people of the city be gone with their cats and dogs and what hath Allah done with them?' Now I was anhungred so I took hot bread from a baker's oven and going into the shop of an oilman, spread the bread with clarified butter and honey and ate. Then I entered the shop of a sherbet-seller and drank what I would; after which, seeing a coffee-shop open, I went in and found the pots on the fire, full of coffee; but there was no one there. So I drank my fill and said, 'Verily, this is a wondrous thing! It seemeth as though Death had stricken the people of this city and they had all died this very hour, or as if they had taken fright at something which befel them and fled, without having time to shut their shops.' Now whilst pondering this matter, lo! I heard a sound of a band of drums beating; whereat I was afraid and hid myself for a while: then, looking out through a crevice, I saw damsels, like moons, come walking through the market, two by two, with uncovered heads and faces displayed. They were in forty pairs, thus numbering fourscore and in their midst a young lady, riding on a horse that could hardly move his legs for that which was upon it of silvern trappings and golden and jewelled housings. Her face was wholly unveiled, and she was adorned with the costliest ornaments and clad in the richest of raiment and about her neck she wore a collar of gems and on her bosom were necklaces of gold; her wrists were clasped with bracelets which sparkled like stars, and her ankles with bangles of gold set with precious stones. The slave-girls walked before her and behind and on her right and left and in front of her was a damsel bearing in baldric a great sword, with grip of emerald and tassels of jewel-encrusted gold. When that young lady came to where I lay hid, she pulled up her horse and said, 'O damsels, I hear a noise of somewhat within yonder shop: so do ye search it, lest haply there be one hidden there, with intent to enjoy a look at us, whilst we have our faces unveiled.' So they searched the shop opposite the coffee-house wherein I lay hid, whilst I abode in terror; and presently I saw them come forth with a man and they said to her, 'O our lady, we found a man there and here he is before thee.' Quoth she to the damsel with the sword, 'Smite his neck.' So she went up to him and struck off his head; then, leaving the dead man lying on the ground, they passed on. When I saw this, I was affrighted; but my heart was taken with love of the young lady. After an hour or so, the people reappeared and every one who had a shop entered it; whilst the folk began to come and go about the bazars and gathered around the slain man, staring at him as a curiosity. Then I crept forth from my hiding place by stealth, and none took note of me, but love of that lady had gotten possession of my heart, and I began to enquire of her privily. None, however, gave me news of her; so I left Bassorah, with vitals yearning for her love; and when I came upon this thy son, I saw him to be the likest of all creatures to the young lady; wherefore he reminded me of her and his sight revived the fire of passion in me and kindled anew in my heart the flames of love-longing and distraction. And such is the cause of my shedding tears!"" Then he wept with sore weeping till he could no more and said, ""O my lord, I conjure thee by Allah, open the door to me, so I may gang my gait!"" Accordingly Abd al-Rahman opened the door and he went forth. Thus fared it with him; but as regards Kamar al-Zaman, when he heard the Dervish's story, his heart was taken with love of the lady and passion gat the mastery of him and raged in him longing and distraction; so, on the morrow, he said to his sire, ""All the sons of the merchants wander about the world to attain their desire, nor is there one of them but his father provideth for him a stock-in-trade wherewithal he may travel and traffic for gain. Why, then, O my father, dost thou not outfit me with merchandise, so I may fare with it and find my luck?"" He replied, ""O my son, such merchants lack money; so they send their sons to foreign parts for the sake of profit and pecuniary gain and provision of the goods of the world. But I have monies in plenty nor do I covet more: why then should I exile thee? Indeed, I cannot brook to be parted from thee an hour, more especially as thou art unique in beauty and loveliness and perfect grace and I fear for thee."" But Kamar al-Zaman said, ""O my father, nothing will serve but thou must furnish me with merchandise wherewithal to travel; else will I fly from thee at unawares though without money or merchandise. So, an thou wish to solace my heart, make ready for me a stock-in-trade, that I may travel and amuse myself by viewing the countries of men."" Abd al-Rahman, seeing his son enamoured of travel, acquainted his wife with this, saying, ""Verily thy son would have me provide him with goods, so he may fare therewith to far regions, albeit Travel is Travail."" Quoth she, ""What is there to displease thee in this? Such is the wont of the sons of the merchants and they all vie one with other in glorifying globe-trotting and gain."" Quoth he, ""Most of the merchants are poor and seek growth of good; but I have wealth galore."" She replied, ""More of a good thing hurteth not; and, if thou comply not with his wish, I will furnish him with goods of my own monies."" Quoth Abd al-Rahman, ""I fear strangerhood for him, inasmuch as travel is the worst of trouble;"" but she said, ""There is no harm in strangerhood for him when it leadeth to gaining good; and, if we consent not, our son will go away and we shall seek him and not find him and be dishonoured among the folk."" The merchant accepted his wife's counsel and provided his son with merchandise to the value of ninety thousand gold pieces, whilst his mother gave him a purse containing forty bezel-stones, jewels of price, the least of the value of one of which was five hundred ducats, saying, ""O my son, be careful of this jewellery for 'twill be of service to thee."" Thereupon Kamar al-Zaman took the jewels and set out for Bassorah,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Nine Hundred and Sixty-seventh Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al-Zaman took the jewels and set out for Bassorah after he had laid them in a belt, which he buckled about his waist; and he stayed not till there remained aught but a day's journey between that city and himself; when the Arabs came out upon him and stripped him naked and slew his men and servants; but he laid himself down among the slain and wallowed in their blood, so that the wildlings took him for dead and left him without even turning him over and made off with their booty. When the Arabs had gone their ways, Kamar al-Zaman arose, having naught left but the jewels in his girdle, and fared on nor ceased faring till he came to Bassorah. It chanced that his entry was on a Friday and the town was void of folk, even as the Dervish had informed him. He found the market-streets deserted and the shops wide open and full of goods; so he ate and drank and looked about him. Presently, he heard a band of drums beating and hid himself in a shop, till the slave-girls came up, when he looked at them; and, seeing the young lady riding amongst them, love and longing overcame him and desire and distraction overpowered him, so that he had no force to stand. After awhile, the people reappeared and the bazars filled. Whereupon he went to the market and repairing to a jeweller and pulling out one of his forty gems sold it for a thousand dinars, wherewith he returned to his place and passed the night there; and when morning morrowed he changed his clothes and going to the Hamman came forth as he were the full moon. Then he sold other four stones for four thousand dinars and sauntered solacing himself about the main streets of Bassorah, clad in the costliest of clothes; till he came to a market, where he saw a barber's shop. So he went in to the barber who shaved his head; and, clapping up an acquaintance with him, said to him, ""O my father, I am a stranger in these parts and yesterday I entered this city and found it void of folk, nor was there in it any living soul, man nor Jinni. Then I saw a troop of slave-girls and amongst them a young lady riding in state:"" and he went on to tell him all he had seen. Said the barber, ""O my son, hast thou told any but me of this?""; and he said, ""No."" The other rejoined, ""Then, O my son, beware thou mention this before any but me; for all folk cannot keep a secret and thou art but a little lad and I fear lest the talk travel from man to man, till it reach those whom it concerneth and they slay thee. For know, O my son, that this thou hast seen, none ever kenned nor knew in other than this city. As for the people of Bassorah they are dying of this annoy; for every Friday forenoon they shut up the dogs and cats, to hinder them from going about the market-streets, and all the people of the city enter the cathedral-mosques, where they lock the doors on them and not one of them can pass about the bazar nor even look out of casement; nor knoweth any the cause of this calamity. But, O my son, to-night I will question my wife concerning the reason thereof, for she is a midwife and entereth the houses of the notables and knoweth all the city news. So Inshallah, do thou come to me to-morrow and I will tell thee what she shall have told me."" With this Kamar al-Zaman pulled out a handful of gold and said to him, ""O my father, take this gold and give it to thy wife, for she is become my mother."" Then he gave him a second handful, saying, ""Take this for thyself."" Whereupon quoth the barber, ""O my son, sit thou in thy place, till I go to my wife and ask her and bring the news of the true state of the case."" So saying, he left him in the shop and going home, acquainted his wife with the young man's case, saying, ""I would have thee tell me the truth of this city-business, so I may report it to this young merchant, for he hath set his heart on weeting the reason why men and beasts are forbidden the market-streets every Friday forenoon; and methinks he is a lover, for he is openhanded and liberal, and if we tell him what he would trow, we shall get great good of him."" Quoth she, ""Go back and say to him, 'Come, speak with thy mother, my wife, who sendeth her salam to thee and saith to thee, Thy wish is won.'"" Accordingly he returned to the shop, where he found Kamar al-Zaman sitting awaiting him and repeated him the very words spoken by his spouse. Then he carried him in to her and she welcomed him and bade him sit down; whereupon he pulled out an hundred ducats and gave them to her, saying, ""O my mother, tell me who this young lady may be."" Said she, ""Know, O my son, that there came a gem to the Sultan of Bassorah from the King of Hind, and he was minded to have it pierced. So he summoned all the jewellers in a body and said to them, 'I wish you to drill me this jewel. Whoso pierceth it, I will give him whatsoever he shall ask; but if he break it, I will cut off his head.' At this they were afraid and said, 'O King of the age, a jewel is soon spoilt and there are few who can pierce them without injury, for most of them have a flaw. So do not thou impose upon us a task to which we are unable; for our hands cannot avail to drill this jewel. However, our Shaykh is more experienced than we.' Asked the King, 'And who is your Shaykh?'; and they answered, 'Master Obayd: he is more versed than we in this art and hath wealth galore and of skill great store. Therefore do thou send for him to the presence and bid him pierce thee this jewel.' Accordingly the King sent for Obayd and bade him pierce the jewel, imposing on him the condition aforesaid. He took it and pierced it to the liking of the King who said to him, 'Ask a boon of me, O master'; and said he, 'O King of the age, allow me delay till to-morrow.' Now the reason of this was that he wished to take counsel with his wife, who is the young lady thou sawest riding in procession; for he loveth her with exceeding love, and of the greatness of his affection for her, he doth naught without consulting her; wherefore he put off asking till the morrow. When he went home, he said to her, 'I have pierced the King a jewel and he hath granted me a boon which I deferred asking till to-morrow, that I might consult thee. Now what dost thou wish, that I may ask it?' Quoth she, 'We have riches such as fires may not consume; but, an thou love me, ask of the King to make proclamation in the streets of Bassorah that all the townsfolk shall every Friday enter the mosques, two hours before the hour of prayer, so none may abide in the town at all great or small except they be in the mosques or in the houses and the doors be locked upon them, and that every shop of the town be left open. Then will I ride with my slave-women through the heart of the city and none shall look on me from window or lattice; and every one whom I find abroad I will kill.' So he went in to the King and begged of him this boon, which he granted him and caused proclamation to be made amongst the Bassorites,""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When is was the Nine Hundred and Sixty-eighth Night,
She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the barber's wife said, ""When the Jeweller begged his boon, the King bade proclamation be made amongst the Bassorites, but the people objected that they feared for their goods from the cats and dogs; wherefore he commanded to shut the animals up till the folk should come forth from the Friday prayers. So the jeweller's wife fell to sallying forth every Friday, two hours before the time of congregational prayer, and riding in state through the city with her women; during which time none dareth pass through the market-place nor look out of casement or lattice. This, then, is what thou wouldest know and I have told thee who she is; but, O my son, was it thy desire only to have news of her or hast thou a mind to meet her?"" Answered he, ""O my mother, 'tis my wish to foregather with her."" Quoth she, ""Tell me what valuables thou hast with thee""; and quoth he, ""O my mother, I have with me precious stones of four sorts, the first worth five hundred dinars each, the second seven hundred, the third eight hundred and the fourth a thousand ducats."" She asked, ""Art thou willing to spend four of these?""; and he answered, ""I am ready to spend all of them."" She rejoined, ""Then, arise, O my son, and go straight to thy lodging and take a bezel-gem of those worth five hundred sequins, with which do thou repair to the jewel market and ask for the shop of Master Obayd, the Shaykh of the Jewellers. Go thither and thou wilt find him seated in his shop, clad in rich clothes, with workmen under his hand. Salute him and sit down on the front shelf of his shop; then pull out the jewel and give it to him, saying, 'O master, take this stone and fashion it into a seal-ring for me with gold. Make it not large, a Miskál in weight and no more; but let the fashion of it be thy fairest.' Then give him twenty dinars and to each of his prentices a dinar. Sit with him awhile and talk with him and if a beggar approach thee, show thy generosity by giving him a dinar, to the intent that he may affect thee, and after this, leave him and return to thy place. Pass the night there, and next morning, take an hundred dinars and bring them and give them to thy father the barber, for he is poor."" Quoth Kamar al-Zaman, ""Be it so,"" and returning to his caravanserai, took a jewel worth five hundred gold pieces and went with it to the jewel-bazar. There he enquired for the shop of Master Obayd, Shaykh of the Jewellers, and they directed him thereto. So he went thither and saw the Shaykh, a man of austere aspect and robed in sumptuous raiment with four journeymen under his hand. He addressed him with ""Peace be upon you!"" and the jeweller returned his greeting and welcoming him, made him sit down. Then he brought out the jewel and said, ""O master, I wish thee to make me this jewel into a seal-ring with gold. Let it be the weight of a Miskal and no more, but fashion it excellently."" Then he pulled out twenty dinars and gave them to him, saying, ""This is the fee for chasing and the price of the ring shall remain."" And he gave each of the apprentices a gold piece, wherefore they loved him, and so did Master Obayd. Then he sat talking with the jeweller and whenever a beggar came up to him, he gave him a gold piece and they all marvelled at his generosity. Now Master Obayd had tools at home, like those he had in the shop, and whenever he was minded to do any unusual piece of work, it was his custom to carry it home and do it there, that his journeymen might not learn the secrets of his wonderful workmanship. His wife used to sit before him, and when she was sitting thus and he looking upon her, he would fashion all manner of marvellously wroughten trinkets, such as were fit for none but kings. So he went home and sat down to mould the ring with admirable workmanship. When his wife saw him thus engaged, she asked him, ""What wilt thou do with this bezel-gem?""; and he answered, ""I mean to make it into a ring with gold, for 'tis worth five hundred dinars."" She enquired, ""For whom?""; and he answered, ""For a young merchant, who is fair of face, with eyes that wound with desire, and cheeks that strike fire and mouth like the seal of Sulaymán and cheeks like the bloom of Nu'mán and lips red as coralline and neck like the antelope's long and fine. His complexion is white dashed with red and he is well-bred, pleasant and generous and doth thus and thus."" And he went on to describe to her now his beauty and loveliness and then his perfection and bounty and ceased not to vaunt his charms and the generosity of his disposition, till he had made her in love with him; for there is no sillier cuckold than he who vaunteth to his wife another man's handsome looks and unusual liberality in money matters. So, when desire rose high in her, she said to him, ""Is aught of my charms found in him?"" Said he, ""He hath all thy beauties; and he is thy counterpart in qualities. Meseemeth his age is even as thine and but that I fear to hurt thy feelings, I would say that he is a thousand times handsomer than thou art."" She was silent, yet the fire of fondness was kindled in her heart. And the jeweller ceased not to talk with her and to set out Kamar al-Zaman's charms before her till he had made an end of moulding the ring; when he gave it to her and she put it on her finger, which it fitted exactly. Quoth she, ""O my lord, my heart loveth this ring and I long for it to be mine and will not take it from my finger."" Quoth he, ""Have patience! The owner of it is generous, and I will seek to buy it of him, and if he will sell it, I will bring it to thee. Or if he have another such stone, I will buy it and fashion it for thee into a ring like this.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Nine Hundred and Sixty-ninth Night,
She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the jeweller said to his wife, ""Have patience! The owner of it is generous and I will seek to buy it of him; and, if he will sell it, I will bring it to thee; or, if he have another such stone I will buy it and fashion it for thee into a ring like this."" On this wise it fared with the jeweller and his wife; but as regards Kamar al-Zaman, he passed the night in his lodging and on the morrow he took an hundred dinars and carried them to the old woman, the barber's wife, saying to her, ""Accept these gold pieces,"" and she replied, ""Give them to thy father."" So he gave them to the barber and she asked, ""Hast thou done as I bade thee?"" He answered, ""Yes,"" and she said, ""Go now to the Shaykh, the jeweller, and if he give thee the ring, put it on the tip of thy finger and pull it off in haste and say to him, 'O master, thou hast made a mistake; the ring is too tight.' He will say, 'O merchant, shall I break it and mould it again larger?' And do thou say, 'It booteth not to break it and fashion it anew. Take it and give it to one of thy slave-women.' Then pull out another stone worth seven hundred dinars and say to him, 'Take this stone and set it for me, for 'tis handsomer than the other.' Give him thirty dinars and to each of the prentices two, saying, 'These gold pieces are for the chasing and the price of the ring shall remain.' Then return to thy lodging for the night and on the morrow bring me two hundred ducats, and I will complete thee the rest of the device."" So the youth went to the jeweller, who welcomed him and made him sit down in his shop; and he asked him, ""Hast thou done my need?"" ""Yes,"" answered Obayd and brought out to him the seal-ring; whereupon he set it on his finger-tip and pulling it off in haste, cried, ""Thou hast made a mistake, O master;"" and threw it to him, saying, ""'Tis too strait for my finger."" Asked the jeweller, ""O merchant, shall I make it larger?"" But he answered, ""Not so; take it as a gift and give it to one of thy slave-girls. Its worth is trifling, some five hundred dinars; so it booteth not to fashion it over again."" Then he brought out to him another stone worth seven hundred sequins and said to him, ""Set this for me: 'tis a finer gem."" Moreover he gave him thirty dinars and to each of his workmen two. Quoth Obayd, ""O my lord we will take the price of the ring when we have made it."" But Kamar al-Zaman said, ""This is for the chasing, and the price of the ring remains over."" So saying, he went away home, leaving the jeweller and his men amazed at the excess of his generosity. Presently the jeweller returned to his wife and said, ""O Halimah, never did I set eyes on a more generous than this young man, and as for thee, thy luck is good, for he hath given me the ring without price, saying, 'Give it to one of thy slave-women.'"" And he told her what had passed, adding, ""Methinks this youth is none of the sons of the merchants, but that he is of the sons of the Kings and Sultans."" Now the more he praised him, the more she waxed in love-longing, passion and distraction for him. So she took the ring and put it on her finger, whilst the jeweller made another one, a little larger than the first. When he had finished moulding it, she put it on her finger, under the first, and said, ""Look, O my lord, how well the two rings show on my finger! I wish they were both mine."" Said he, ""Patience! It may be I shall buy thee this second one."" Then he lay that night and on the morrow he took the ring and went to his shop. As for Kamar al-Zaman, as soon as it was day, he repaired to the barber's wife and gave her two hundred dinars. Quoth she, ""Go to the jeweller and when he giveth thee the ring, put it on thy finger and pull it off again in haste, saying, 'Thou hast made a mistake, O master! This ring is too large. A master like thee, when the like of me cometh to him with a piece of work, it behoveth him to take right measure; and if thou hadst measured my finger, thou hadst not erred.' Then pull out another stone worth a thousand dinars and say to him, 'Take this and set it, and give this ring to one of thy slave-women.' Give him forty ducats and to each of his journeymen three, saying, ""This is for the chasing, and for the cost of the ring, that shall remain.' And see what he will say. Then bring three hundred diners and give them to thy father the barber that he may mend his fortune withal, for he is a poor man."" Answered Kamar al-Zaman, ""I hear and obey,"" and betook himself to the jeweller, who welcomed him and making him sit down, gave him the ring. He took it and put it on his finger; then pulled it off in haste and said, ""It behoveth a master like thee, when the like of me bringeth him a piece of work, to take his measure. Hadst thou measured my finger, thou hadst not erred but take it and give it to one of thy slave women."" Then he brought out to him a stone worth a thousand sequins and said to him, ""Take this and set it in a signet-ring for me after the measure of my finger."" Quoth Obayd, ""Thou hast spoken sooth and art in the right;"" and took his measure, whereupon he pulled out forty gold pieces and gave them to him, saying, ""Take these for the chasing and the price of the ring shall remain."" Cried the jeweller, ""O my lord, how much hire have we taken of thee' Verily, thy bounty to us is great!"" ""No harm,"" replied Kamar al-Zaman and sat talking with him awhile and giving a diner to every beggar who passed by the shop. Then he left him and went away, whilst the jeweller returned home and said to his wife, 'How generous is this young merchant! Never did I set eyes on a more open handed or a comelier than he, no, nor a sweeter of speech. And he went on to recount to her his charms and generosity and was loud in his praise. Cried she, ""O thou lack tact, since thou notest these qualities in him, and indeed he hath given thee two seal rings of price, it behoveth thee to invite him and make him an entertainment and entreat him lovingly. When he seest that thou affectest him and cometh to our place, we shall surely get great good of him; and if thou grudge him the banquet do thou bid him and I will entertain him of my monies."" Quoth he, ""Dost thou know me to be niggardly, that thou sayest this Say?; and quoth she, ""Thou art no niggard, but thou lackest tact. Invite him this very night and come not without him. An he refuse, conjure him by the divorce oath and be persistent with him ""On my head and eyes,"" answered he and moulded the ring till he had finished it, after which he passed the night and went forth on the morrow to his shop and sat there. On this wise it was with him, but as for Kamar al-Zaman, he took three hundred diners and carrying them to the old wife, gave them to her for the barber, her husband. Said she, ""Most like he will invite thee to his house this day; and if he do this and thou pass the night there, tell me in the morning what befalleth thee and bring with thee four hundred diners and give them to thy father."" Answered he, ""Hearing and obeying;"" and as often as he ran out of money, he would sell some of his stones. So he repaired to the jeweller, who rose to him and received him with open arms, greeted him heartily and clapped up companionship with him. Then he gave him the ring, and he found it after the measure of his finger and said to the jeweller, ""Allah bless thee, O prince of artists! The setting is conformable but the stone is not to my liking."" And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say,
When it was the Nine Hundred and Seventieth Night,
She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al-Zaman said to the jeweller, ""The setting is conformable to my wishes, but the stone is not to my liking. I have a handsomer than this: so take the seal-ring and give it to one of thy slave women."" Then he gave him a fourth stone and an hundred diners, saying, ""Take thy hire and excuse the trouble we have given thee."" Obayd replied, ""O merchant, all the trouble thou hast given us thou hast requited us and hast over whelmed us with thy great bounties: and indeed my heart is taken with love of thee and I cannot brook parting from thee. So, Allah upon thee, be thou my guest this night and heal my heart."" He rejoined, ""So be it; but needs must I go to my Khan, that I may give a charge to my domestics and tell them that I shall sleep abroad to night, so they may not expect me."" ""Where dost thou lodge?"" asked the jeweller; and he answered, ""In such a Khan."" Quoth Obayd, ""I will come for thee there;"" and quoth the other ""'Tis well."" So the jeweller repaired to the Khan before sundown, fearing lest his wife should be anangered with him, if he returned home without his guest; and, carrying Kamar al-Zaman to his house, seated him in a saloon that had not its match, Halimah saw him, as he entered, and was ravished with him. They talked till supper was served when they ate and drank; after which appeared coffee and sherbets, and the jeweller ceased not to entertain him with talk till eventide, when they prayed the obligatory prayers. Then entered a handmaid with two cups of night drink, which when they had drunk, drowsiness overcame them and they slept. Presently in came the jeweller's wife and seeing them asleep, looked upon Kamar al-Zaman's face and her wit was confounded at his beauty. Said she, ""How can he sleep who loveth the fair?"" and, turning him over on his back, sat astraddle upon his breast. Then, in the mania of her passion for him, she rained down kisses on his cheeks, till she left a mark upon them and they became exceeding red and his cheek bones shone; and, she sucked his lips, till the blood ran out into her mouth; but with all this, her fire was not quenched nor her thirst assuaged. She ceased not to kiss and clip him and twine leg with leg, till the forebrow of Morn grew white and the dawn broke forth in light; when she put in his pocket four cockals and went away. Then she sent her maid with something like snuff, which she applied to their nostrils and they sneezed and awoke, when the slave-girl said, ""O my lords, prayer is a duty; so rise ye and pray the dawn-prayer."" And she brought them basin and ewer. Quoth Kaman al-Zamar ""O master, 'tis late and we have overslept ourselves;"" and quoth the jeweller, ""O my friend verily the air of this room is heavy; for, whenever I sleep in it, this happens to me."" Rejoined Kamar al-Zaman, ""True,"" and proceeded to make the Wuzu ablution; but, when he put the water to his face, his cheeks and lips burned him. Cried he, ""Prodigious! If the air of the room be heavy and we have been drowned in sleep, what aileth my cheeks and lips that they burn me?"" And he said to the jeweller, ""O master, my cheeks and lips burn me."" The other replied, ""I guess this cometh of the mosquito bites."" ""Strange!"" said Kamar al-Zaman. ""Hath this thing happened to thee?"" Replied Obayd, ""No! But whenever I have by me a guest like thee, he complaineth in the morning of the mosquito bites, and this happeneth only when he is like thee beardless. If he be bearded the mosquitoes sting him not, and naught hindereth them from me but my beard. It seems mosquitoes love not bearded men."" Rejoined Kamar al-Zaman, ""True."" Then the maid brought them early breakfast and they broke their fast and went out. Kamar al-Zaman betook himself to the old woman, who exclaimed, when she saw him, ""I see the marks of joyance on thy face: tell me what thou hast seen."" Said he, ""I have seen nothing. Only I supped with the house master in a saloon and prayed the night prayer, after which we fell asleep and woke not till morning."" She laughed and said, ""What be those marks on thy cheeks and lips?"" He answered, ""'Twas the mosquitoes of the saloon that did this with me;"" and she rejoined, ""'Tis well. But did the same thing betide the house master?"" He retorted, ""Nay; but he told me that the mosquitoes of that saloon molest not bearded men, but sting those only who have no hair on face, and that whenever he hath for guest one who is beard less, the stranger awaketh complaining of the mosquito bites; whereas an he have a beard, there befalleth him naught of this."" Said she, ""Sooth thou speakest: but say me, sawest thou aught save this?"" And he answered, ""I found four cockals in my pocket."" Quoth she, ""Show them to me."" So he gave them to her and she laughed and said, ""Thy mistress laid these in thy pocket."" He asked, ""How so?"" And she answered, "" 'Tis as if she said to thee, in the language of signs, 'An thou wert in love, thou wouldst not sleep, for a lover sleepeth not: but thou hast not ceased to be a child and fit for nothing but to play with these cockals. So what crave thee to fall in love with the fair?' Now she came to thee by night and finding thee asleep, scored thy cheeks with her kisses and left thee this sign. But that will not suffice her of thee and she will certainly send her husband to invite thee again to night; so, when thou goest home with him, hasten not to fall asleep, and on the morrow bring me five hundred diners and come and acquaint me with what hath passed, and I will perfect for thee the device."" Answered he, ""I hear and obey,"" and went back to the Khan. Thus it befel him; but as regards the jeweller's wife, she said to her husband, ""Is the guest gone?"" Answered he, ""Yes, but, O Halimah,the mosquitoes plagued him last night and scarified his cheeks and lips, and indeed I was abashed before him."" She rejoined, ""This is the wont of the mosquitoes of our saloon; for they love none save the beardless. But do thou invite him again to night."" So he repaired to the Khan where the youth abode, and bidding him, carried him to his house, where they ate and drank and prayed the night prayer in the saloon, after which the slave-girl entered and gave each of them a cup of night drink, And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Nine Hundred and Seventy first Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the slave- girl went in to the twain and gave each of them a cup of night drink, and they drank and fell asleep. Presently, in came Halimah and said, ""O good for nothing, how canst thou sleep and call thy self a lover? A lover sleepeth not!"" Then she mounted on his breast and ceased not to come down upon him with kisses and caresses, biting and sucking his lips and so forth, till the morning. when she put in his pocket a knife and sent her handmaid to arouse them. And when the youth awoke, his cheeks were on fire, for excess of redness, and his lips like coral, for dint of sucking and kissing. Quoth the jeweller, ""Did the mosquitoes plague thee last night?""; and quoth the other, ""Nay!""; for he now knew the conceit and left complaining. Then he felt the knife in his pocket and was silent; but when he had broken his fast and drunk coffee, he left the jeweller and going to the Khan; took five hundred diners of gold and carried them to the old woman, to whom he related what had passed, saying, ""I slept despite myself, and when I woke at dawn I found nothing but a knife in my pocket."" Exclaimed the old trot, ""May Allah protect thee from her this next night! For she saith to thee by this sign, 'An thou sleep again, I will cut thy throat.' Thou wilt once more be bidden to the jeweller's house to night, and if thou sleep, she will slay thee."" Said he, ""What is to be done?""; and said she, ""Tell me what thou atest and drankest before sleeping."" Quoth he, ""We supped as was our wont and prayed the night prayer, after which there came in to us a maid, who gave each of us a cup of night drink, which when I had drunk, I fell asleep and awoke not till the morning."" Quoth the old woman, ""The mischief is in the cup: so, when the maid giveth it to thee, take it from her, but drink not and wait till the master of the house have drunken and fallen asleep; then say to her, 'Give me a draught of water,' and she will go to fetch thee the gugglet. Then do thou empty the cup behind the pillow and lie down and feign sleep. So when she cometh back with the gugglet, she will deem that thou hast fallen asleep, after having drunk off the cup, and will leave thee; and presently the case will appear to thee; but beware of disobeying my bidding."" Answered he, ""I hear and I obey,"" and returned to the Khan. Meanwhile the jeweller's wife said to her husband, ""A guest's due honour is three nights' entertainment: so do thou invite him a third time."" Whereupon he betook himself to the youth and inviting him, carried him home and sat down with him in the saloon. When they had supped and prayed the night prayer, behold, in came the handmaid and gave each of them a cup. Her master drank and fell asleep; but Kamar al-Zaman forbore to drink, whereupon quoth the maid, ""Wilt thou not drink, O my lord?"" Answered he, ""I am athirst, bring me the gugglet."" Accordingly she went to fetch it, and he emptied the cup behind the pillow and lay down. When the slave-girl returned, she saw him lying down and going to her mistress said, ""He hath drunk off the cup and fallen asleep;"" whereupon quoth Halimah to herself, ""Verily, his death is better than his life."" Then, taking a sharp knife, she went in to him, saying, ""Three times, and thou notedst not the sign, O fool! So now I will rip up thy maw."" When he saw her making for him knife in hand, he opened his eyes and rose, laughing; whereupon said she, ""'Twas not of thine own wit, that thou camest at the meaning of the sign, but by the help of some wily cheat; so tell me whence thou hadst this knowledge."" ""From an old woman,"" replied he, ""between whom and me befel such and such;"" and he told her all that had passed. Quoth she, ""To morrow go thou forth from us and seek her and say, 'Hast thou any further device in store?' And if she answer, 'I have,' do thou rejoin, 'Then do thy best that I may enjoy her publicly.' But, if she say, 'I have no means of doing that, and this is the last of my devices,' put her away from thy thought, and to morrow night my husband will come to thee and invite thee. Do thou come with him and tell me and I will consider what remaineth to be done."" Answered he, ""There is no harm in that!"" Then he spent the rest of the night with her in embracing and clipping, plying the particle of copulation in concert and joining the conjunctive with the conjoined, whilst her husband was as a cast-out nunnation of construction. And they ceased not to be thus till morning, when she said to him, ""'Tis not a night of thee that will content me, nor a day; no, nor yet a month nor a year; but it's my intent to abide with thee the rest of my life. Wait, however, till I play my husband a trick which would baffle the keenest witted and win for us our wishes. I will cause doubt to enter into him, so that he shall divorce me, whereupon I will marry thee and go with thee to thine own country; I will also transport all his monies and hoards to thy lodging and will contrive thee the ruin of his dwelling place and the blotting out of his traces. But do thou hearken to my speech and obey me in that I shall say to thee and gainsay me not."" He replied, ""I hear and I obey: in me there is none opposition."" Then said she, ""Go to the Khan and, when my husband cometh to thee and inviteth thee, say to him, 'O my brother, a son of Adam is apt to be burdensome, and when his visits grow over frequent, both generous and niggard loathe him. How then shall I go with thee every night and lie I and thee, on the saloon? An thou wax not chagrined with me, thy Harim will bear me grudge, for that I hinder thee from thine. Therefore if thou have a mind to my company, take me a house beside thine own and we will abide thus, now I sitting with thee till the time of sleep, and now with me thou. Then I will go to my place and thou to thy Harim and this will be a better rede than that I hinder thee from thy Harim every night.' Then will he come to me and take counsel with me, and I will advise him to turn out our neighbour, for the house wherein he liveth is our house and he renteth it of us; and once thou art in the house, Allah will make easy to us the rest of our scheme."" And presently she added, ""Go now and do as I bid thee."" Answered he, ""I hear and obey;"" whereupon she left him and went away, whilst he lay down and feigned to be asleep. Presently, the handmaid came and aroused them; and when the jeweller awoke, he said to his guest, ""O merchant have the mosquitoes worried thee?"" He replied, ""No,"" and Obayd said, ""Belike thou art grown used to them."" Then they broke their fast and drank coffee, after which they fared forth to their affairs, and Kamar al-Zaman betook himself to the old crone, and related to her what had passed, And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Nine Hundred and Seventy-second Night,
She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Kamar al-Zaman betook himself to the old crone, he related to her what had passed, saying, ""She spake to me this and that, and I answered her thus and thus. Now say me, hast thou any farther device for bringing me to enjoy her publicly?"" Quoth she, ""O my son, here endeth my contrivance, and now I am at the term of my devices."" Upon this he left her and returned to the Khan where, as eventide evened, the jeweller came to him and invited him. He said, ""I cannot go with thee."" Asked the merchant, ""Why so? I love thee and cannot brook separation from thee. Allah upon thee come with me!"" The other replied, ""An it be thy wish to continue our comradeship and keep up the friendship betwixt thee and me, take me a house by the side of thine own and when thou wilt, thou shalt pass the evening with me and I with thee; but, as soon as the time of sleep cometh, each of us shall hie him to his own home and lie there."" Quoth Obayd, ""I have a house adjoining mine, which is my own property: so go thou with me to night and to- morrow I will have the house untenanted for thee."" Accordingly he went with him and they supped and prayed the night prayer, after which the jeweller drank the cup of drugged liquor and fell asleep: but in Kamar al-Zaman's cup there was no trick; so he drank it and slept not. Then came the jeweller's wife and sat chatting with him through the dark hours, whilst her husband lay like a corpse. When he awoke in the morning as of wont, he sent for his tenant and said to him, ""O man, quit me the house, for I have need of it."" ""On my head and eyes,"" answered the other and voided the house to him, whereupon Kamar al-Zaman took up his abode therein and transported thither all his baggage. The jeweller passed that evening with him, then went to his own house. On the next day, his wife sent for a cunning builder and bribed him with money to make her an underground-way from her chamber to Kamar al-Zaman's house, with a trap-door under the earth. So, before the youth was ware, she came in to him with two bags of money and he said to her, ""Whence comest thou?"" She showed him the tunnel and said to him, ""Take these two bags of his money."" Then she sat with him, the twain toying and tumbling together till the morning, when she said, ""Wait for me, till I go to him and wake him, so he may go to his shop, and I return to thee."" He sat expecting her, whilst she went away and awoke her husband, who made the Wuzu ablution and prayed and went to his shop. As soon as he was gone, she took four bags and, carrying them through the Souterrain to Kamar al-Zaman, said to him, ""Store these up;"" then she sat with him awhile, after which she retired to her home and he betook himself to the bazar. When he returned at sundown, he found in his house ten purses and jewels and much besides. Presently the jeweller came to him and carried him to his own house, where they passed the evening in the saloon, till the handmaid came in according to custom, and brought them the drink. Her master drank and fell asleep, whilst naught betided Kamar al-Zaman for that his cup was wholesome and there was no trick therein. Then came Halimah who sat down atoying with him, whilst the slave-girl transported the jeweller's goods to Kamar al-Zaman's house by the secret passage. Thus they did till morning, when the handmaid awoke her lord and gave them to drink coffee, after which they went each his own way. On the third day the wife brought out to him a knife of her husband's, which he had chased and wrought with his own hand, and which he priced at five hundred diners. But there was no knife like it and because of the eagerness with which folk sought it of him, he had laid it up in a chest and could not bring himself to sell it to any one in creation. Quoth she, ""Take this knife and set it in thy waist shawl and go to my husband and sit with him. Then pull out the knife and say to him, 'O master, look at this knife I bought to day and tell me if I have the worst or the best of the bargain.' He will know it, but will be ashamed to say to thee, 'This is my knife;' so he will ask thee, 'Whence didst thou buy it and for how much?'; and do thou make answer, 'I saw two Levantines disputing and one said to the other, 'Where hast thou been?' Quoth his companion, 'I have been with my mistress, and whenever I foregather with her, she giveth me ten dirhams; but this day she said to me, 'My hand is empty of silver for thee to day, but take this knife of my husband's.' So I took it and intend to sell it.' The knife pleased me and hearing his tale I said to him, 'Wilt thou sell it to me?' when he replied, 'Buy.' So I got it of him for three hundred gold pieces and I wonder whether it was cheap or dear.' And note what he will say to thee. Then talk with him awhile and rise and come back to me in haste. Thou wilt find me awaiting thee at the tunnel mouth, and do thou give me the knife."" Replied Kamar al-Zaman, ""I hear and I obey,"" and taking the knife set it in his waist-shawl. Then he went to the shop of the jeweller, who saluted him with the salam and welcomed him and made him sit down. He spied the knife in his waist shawl, at which he wondered and said to himself, ""That is my knife: who can have conveyed it to this merchant?"" And he fell a musing and saying in his mind, ""I wonder an it be my knife or a knife like it!"" Presently Kamar al-Zaman pulled it out and said to him, ""Harkye, master; take this knife and look at it."" Obayd took it and knew it right well, but was ashamed to say, ""This is my knife;"" And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Nine Hundred and Seventy-third Night,
She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the jeweller took the knife from Kamar al-Zaman, he knew it, but was ashamed to say, ""This is my knife."" So he asked, ""Where didst thou buy it?"" Kamar al-Zaman answered as Halimah had charged him, and the jeweller said, ""The knife was cheap at that price, for it is worth five hundred diners."" But fire flamed in his heart and his hands were tied from working at his craft. Kamar al-Zaman continued to talk with him, whilst he was drowned in the sea of solicitudes, and for fifty words wherewith the youth bespoke him, he answered him but one; for his heart ached and his frame was racked and his thoughts were troubled and he was even as saith the poet,
""I have no words though folk would have me talk * And who bespeak
             me find me thought waylaid:
Plunged in the Care-sea's undiscovered depths, * Nor aught of
             difference see 'twixt man and maid!""
When Kamar al-Zaman saw his case thus changed, he said to him ""Belike thou art busy at this present,"" and leaving him, returned in hottest haste to his own house, where he found Halimah standing at the passage door awaiting him. Quoth she ""Hast thou done as I bade thee?""; and quoth he, ""Yes."" She asked, ""What said he to thee?""; and he answered, ""He told me that the knife was cheap at that price, for that it was worth five hundred diners: but I could see that he was troubled; so I left him and know not what befel him after that."" Cried she, ""Give me the knife and reck thou not of him."" Then she took the knife and restoring it to its place, sat down. Now after Kamar al-Zaman's departure fire flamed in the jeweller's heart and suspicion was sore upon him and he said to himself, ""Needs must I get up and go look for the knife and cut down doubt with certainty."" So he rose and repaired to his house and went in to his wife, snorting like a dragon; and she said to him, ""What mattereth thee, O my lord?"" He asked, ""Where is my knife?"" and she answered, ""In the chest,"" and smote hand upon breast, saying, ""O my grief! Belike thou hast fallen out with some one and art come to fetch the knife to smite him withal."" Said he, ""Give me the knife. Let me see it."" But said she, ""Not till thou swear to me that thou wilt not smite any one therewith."" So he swore this to her and she opened the chest and brought out to him the knife and he fell to turning it over, saying, ""Verily, this is a wondrous thing!"" Then quoth he to her, ""Take it and lay it back in its place;"" and she, ""Tell me the meaning of all this."" He answered, ""I saw with our friend a knife like this,"" and told her all that had passed between himself and the youth, adding, ""But, when I saw it in the chest, my suspicion ended in certainty."" Said she, ""Haply thou misdoubtedest of me and deemedst that I was the Levantine's mistress and had given him the knife."" He replied, ""Yes, I had my doubts of this; but, when I saw the knife, suspicion was lifted from my heart."" Rejoined she, ""O man, there is now no good in thee!"" And he fell to excusing himself to her, till he appeased her; after which he fared forth and returned to his shop. Next day, she gave Kamar al-Zaman her husband's watch, which he had made with his own hand and whereof none had the like, saying, ""Go to his shop and sit by his side and say to him, 'I saw again to- day him whom I saw yesterday. He had a watch in his hand and said to me, 'Wilt thou buy this watch?' Quoth I, 'Whence hadst thou it?'; and quoth he, 'I was with my mistress and she gave me this watch.' So I bought it of him for eight-and-fifty gold pieces. Look at it: is it cheap at that price or dear?' Note what he shall say to thee; then return to me in haste and give me the watch."" So Kamar al-Zaman repaired to the jeweller and did with him as she had charged him. When Obayd saw the watch, he said, ""This is worth seven hundred ducats;"" and suspicion entered into him. Then the youth left him and returning to the wife, gave her back the watch. Presently, her husband suddenly came in snorting, and said to her, ""Where is my watch?"" Said she, ""Here it is;"" and he cried, ""Give it to me."" So she brought it to him and he exclaimed, ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!""; and she too exclaimed, ""O man, there is something the matter with thee. Tell me what it is."" He replied, ""What shall I say? Verily, I am bewildered by these chances!"" And he recited these couplets,
""Although the Merciful be doubtless with me,
Yet am I sore bewildered, for new griefs
Have compassed me about, or ere I knew it
I have endured till Patience self became
Impatient of my patience.—I have endured
Waiting till Heaven fulfil my destiny.—
I have endured till e'en endurance owned
How I bore up with her; (a thing more bitter
Than bitter aloes) yet though a bitterer thing
Is not, than is that drug it were more bitter
To me should Patience leave me unsustained.""
Then said he to his wife, ""O woman, I saw with the merchant our friend, first my knife, which I knew, for that its fashion was a device of my own wit, nor cloth its like exist; and he told me of it a story that troubled the heart: so I came back and found it at home. Again to day I see him with the watch, whose fashion also is of my own device, nor is there the fellow of it in Bassorah, and of this also he told me a story that saddened my heart. Wherefore I am bewildered in my wit and know not what is to come to me."" Quoth she, ""The purport of thy speech is that thou suspectedst me of being the friend of that merchant and his leman, and eke of giving him thy good; so thou camest to question me and make proof of my perfidy; and, had I not shown thee the knife and the watch, thou hadst been certified of my treason. But since, O man, thou deemest me this ill deme, henceforth I will never again break with thee bread nor drain with thee drink, for I loathe thee with the loathing of prohibition."" So he gentled her and excused himself till he had appeased her and returned, repenting him of having bespoken her thus, to his shop, where he sat, And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Nine Hundred and Seventy-fourth Night,
She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the jeweller quitted his wife, he repented having bespoken her thus and, returning to his shop, he sat there in disquiet sore and anxiety galore, between belief and unbelief. About eventide he went home alone, not bringing Kamar al-Zaman with him: whereupon quoth his wife, ""Where is the merchant?""; and quoth he, ""In his lodgings."" She asked, ""Is the friendship between thee and him grown cold?"" and he answered, ""By Allah, I have taken a dislike to him, because of that which hath betided me from him."" Quoth she, ""Go fetch him, to please me."" So he arose and went in to Kamar al-Zaman in his house; where he saw his own goods strewn about and knew them. At this sight, fire was kindled in his heart and he fell asighing. Quoth the youth, ""How is it that I see thee melancholy?"" Obayd was ashamed to say, ""Here are my goods in thy house: who brought them hither?""; so he replied only, ""A vexation hath betided me; but come thou with me to my house, that we may solace ourselves there."" The other rejoined, ""Let me be in my place: I will not go with thee."" But the jeweller conjured him to come and took him to his house, where they supped and passed the evening together, Kamar al-Zaman talking with the jeweller, who was drowned in the sea of solicitude and for a hundred words, wherewith the guest bespoke him, answered him only one word. Presently, the handmaid brought them two cups of drink, as usual, and they drank; whereupon the jeweller fell asleep, but the youth abode on wake, because his cup was not drugged. Then came Halimah and said to her lover, ""How deemest thou of yonder cornuted, who is drunken in his heedlessness and weeteth not the wiles of women? There is no help for it but that I cozen him into divorcing me. To-morrow, I will disguise myself as a slave-girl and walk after thee to his shop, where do thou say to him, 'O master, I went to-day into the Khan of Al-Yasirjiyah, where I saw this damsel and bought her for a thousand diners. Look at her for me and tell me whether she was cheap at that price or dear.' Then uncover to him my face and breasts and show all of me to him; after which do thou carry me back to thy house, whence I will go to my chamber by the secret passage, so I may see the issue of our affair with him."" Then the twain passed the night in mirth and merriment, converse and good cheer, dalliance and delight till dawn, when she returned to her own place and sent the handmaid to arouse her lawful lord and her lover. Accordingly they arose and prayed the dawn-prayer and brake their fast and drank coffee, after which Obayd repaired to his shop and Kamar al-Zaman betook himself to his own house. Presently, in came Halimah to him by the tunnel, in the guise of a slave-girl, and indeed she was by birth a slave-girl. Then he went out and she walked behind him, till he came to the jeweller's shop and saluting him, sat down and said, ""O master, I went into the Khan of Al-Yasirjiyah to-day, to look about me, and saw this damsel in the broker's hands. She pleased me; so I bought her for a thousand diners and I would have thee look upon her and see if she be cheap at that price or no."" So saying, he uncovered her face and the jeweller saw her to be his own wife. clad in her costliest clothes, tricked out in her finest trinkets and kohl'd and henna'd, even as she was wont to adorn herself before him in the house. He knew with full knowledge her face and dress and trinkets, for those he had wrought with his own hand, and he saw on her fingers the seal rings he had newly made for Kamar al- Zaman, whereby he was certified with entire assurance that she was indeed his very wife. So he asked her, ""What is thy name, O slave-girl?""; and she answered, ""Halimah,"" naming to him her own name; whereat he was amazed and said to the youth, ""For how much didst thou buy her?"" He replied, ""For a thousand diners""; and the jeweller rejoined, ""Thou hast gotten her gratis; for her rings and clothes and trinkets are worth more than that."" Said Kamar al-Zaman, ""May Allah rejoice thee with good news! Since she pleaseth thee, I will carry her to my house;"" and Obayd said, ""Do thy will."" So he took her off to his house, whence she passed through the secret passage to her own apartment and sat there. Meanwhile, fire flamed in the jeweller's heart and he said to himself, ""I will go see my wife. If she be at home, this slave- girl must be her counterpart, and glory be to Him who alone hath no counterpart! But, if she be not at home, 'tis she herself without a doubt."" Then he set off running, and coming to his house, found his wife sitting in the same clothes and ornaments he had seen upon her in the shop; whereupon he beat hand upon hand, saying, ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!"" ""O man,"" asked she, ""art thou mad or what aileth thee? 'Tis not thy wont to do thus, and needs must it be that something hath befallen thee."" Answered he, ""If thou wilt have me tell thee be not vexed."" Quoth she, ""Say on""; so he said, ""Our friend the merchant hath bought a slave-girl, whose shape is as thy shape and her height as thy height; more- over, her name is even as thy name and her apparel is the like of thine apparel. Brief, she resembleth thee in all her attributes, and on her fingers are seal rings like thy seal rings and her trinkets are as thy trinkets. So, when he displayed her to me, methought it was thyself and I was perplexed concerning my case. Would we had never seen this merchant nor companied with him; and would he had never left his own country and we had not known him, for he hath troubled my life which before was serene, causing ill feeling to succeed good faith and making doubt to enter into my heart."" Said she, ""Look in my face, belike I am she who was with him and he is my lover and I disguised myself as a slave-girl and agreed with him that he should display me to thee, so he might lay a snare for thee."" He replied, ""What words are these? Indeed, I never suspected that thou wouldst do the like of this deed."" Now this jeweller was unversed in the wiles of women and knew not how they deal with men, nor had he heard the saying of him who said,
""A heart bore thee off in chase of the fair, * As fled Youth and
           came Age wi' his hoary hair:
Laylá troubles me and love joys are far; * And rival and risks
           brings us cark and care.
An would'st ask me of woman, behold I am * In physic of womankind
           wise and ware:
When grizzleth man's head and his monies fail, * His lot in their
           love is a poor affair.""
Nor that of another,
""Gainsay women; he obeyeth Allah best, who saith them nay And he
           prospers not who giveth them his bridle rein to sway
For they'll hinder him from winning to perfection in his gifts,
           Though a thousand years he study, seeking after wisdom's
           way.""
And a third,
""Women Satans are, made for woe of man: * To Allah I fly from
           such Satanesses!
Whom they lure by their love he to grief shall come * And lose
             bliss of world and the Faith that blesses.""
Said she, ""Here am I sitting in my chamber; so go thou to him forthright and knock at the door and contrive to go in to him quickly. An thou see the damsel with him 'tis a slave-girl of his who resembleth me (and Glory be to Him who hath no resemblance) But, an thou see no slave-girl with him, then am I myself she whom thou sawest with him in the shop, and thine ill thought of me will be stablished."" ""True,"" answered Obayd, and went out leaving her, whereupon she passed through the hidden passage and seating herself by Kamar al-Zaman, told him what had passed, saying, ""Open the door quickly and show me to him."" Now, as they were talking, behold, there came a knocking at the door. Quoth Kamar al-Zaman, ""Who is at the door?""; and quoth the jeweller, ""I, thy friend; thou displayedst to me thy slave- girl in the bazar, and I rejoiced for thee in her, but my joy in her was not completed; so open the door and let me look at her again."" Rejoined he, ""So be it,"" and opened the door to him, whereupon he saw his wife sitting by him. She rose and kissed their hands; and he looked at her; then she talked with him awhile and he saw her not to be distinguished from his wife in aught and said, ""Allah createth whatso He will."" Then he went away more disheartened than before and returned to his own house where he saw his wife sitting, for she had foregone him thither by the souterrain. And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Nine Hundred and Seventy-fifth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the young lady forewent her spouse by the souterrain as he fared through the door and sat down in her upper chamber; so as soon as he entered she asked him, ""What hast thou seen?"" and he answered, ""I found her with her master; and she resembleth thee."" Then said she, ""Off to thy shop and let this suffice thee of ignoble suspicion and never again deem ill of me."" Said he, ""So be it: accord me pardon for what is past."" And she, ""Allah grant thee grace!"" whereupon he kissed her right and left and went back to his shop. Then she again betook herself to Kamar al-Zaman through the underground passage, with four bags of money, and said to him, ""Equip thyself at once for the road and be ready to carry off the money without delay, against I devise for thee the device I have in mind."" So he went out and purchased mules and loaded them and made ready a travelling litter, he also bought Mamelukes and eunuchs and sending, without let or hindrance, the whole without the city, returned to Halimah and said to her, ""I have made an end of my affairs."" Quoth she, ""And I on my side am ready; for I have transported to thy house all the rest of his monies and treasures and have left him nor little nor much, whereof he may avail himself. All this is of my love for thee, O dearling of my heart, for I would sacrifice my husband to thee a thousand times. But now it behoveth, thou go to him and farewell him, saying, 'I purpose to depart after three days and am come to bid thee adieu; so do thou reckon what I owe thee for the hire of the house that I may send it to thee and acquit my conscience.' Note his reply and return to me and tell me; for I can no more; I have done my best, by cozening him, to anger him with me and cause him to put me away, but I find him none the less infatuated with me. So nothing will serve us but to depart to thine own country."" And quoth he, ""O rare! an but swevens prove true!"" Then he went to the jeweller's shop and sitting down by him, said to him, ""O master, I set out for home in three days' time, and am come to farewell thee. So I would have thee reckon what I owe thee for the hire of the house, that I may pay it to thee and acquit my conscience."" Answered Obayd, ""What talk is this? Verily, 'tis I who am indebted to thee. By Allah, I will take nothing from thee for the rent of the house, for thou hast brought down blessings upon us! However, thou desolatest me by thy departure, and but that it is forbidden to me, I would certainly oppose thee and hinder thee from returning to thy country and kinsfolk."" Then he took leave of him, whilst they both wept with sore weeping and the jeweller went with him, and when they entered Kamar al-Zaman's house, there they found Halimah who stood before them and served them; but when Obayd returned home, he found her sitting there; nor did he cease to see her thus in each house in turn, for the space of three days, when she said to Kamar al-Zaman, ""Now have I transported to thee all that he hath of monies and hoards and carpets and things of price, and there remaineth with him naught save the slave-girl, who used to come in to you with the night drink: but I cannot part with her, for that she is my kinswoman and she is dear to me as a confidante. So I will beat her and be wroth with her and when my spouse cometh home, I will say to him, 'I can no longer put up with this slave-girl nor stay in the house with her; so take her and sell her.' Accordingly he will sell her and do thou buy her, that we may carry her with us."" Answered he, ""No harm in that."" So she beat the girl and when the jeweller came in, he found her weeping and asked her why she wept. Quoth she, ""My mistress hath beaten me."" He then went in to his wife and said to her, ""What hath that accursed girl done, that thou hast beaten her?"" She replied, ""O man, I have but one word to say to thee, and 'tis that I can no longer bear the sight of this girl; so take her and sell her, or else divorce me."" Quoth he, ""I will sell her that I may not cross thee in aught;"" and when he went out to go to the shop he took her and passed with her by Kamar al-Zaman. No sooner had he gone out than his wife slipped through the under ground passage to Kamar al-Zaman, who placed her in the litter, before the Shaykh her husband reached him. When the jeweller came up and the lover saw the slave-girl with him, he asked him, ""What girl is this?""; and the other answered, ""'Tis my slave-girl who used to serve us with the night drink; she hath disobeyed her mistress who is wroth with her and hath bidden me sell her."" Quoth the youth, ""An her mistress have taken an aversion to her, there is for her no abiding with her; but sell her to me, that I may smell your scent in her, and I will make her handmaid to my slave Halimah."" ""Good,"" answered Obayd: ""take her."" Asked Kamar al-Zaman, ""What is her price?""; but the jeweller said, ""I will take nothing from thee, for thou hast been bountiful to us."" So he accepted her from him and said to Halimah, ""Kiss thy lord's hand."" Accordingly, she came out from the litter and kissing Obayd's hand, remounted, whilst he looked hard at her. Then said Kamar al-Zaman, ""I commend thee to Allah, O Master Obayd! Acquit my conscience of responsibility."" Answered the jeweller, ""Allah acquit thee! and carry thee safe to thy family!"" Then he bade him farewell and went to his shop weeping, and indeed it was grievous to him to part from Kamar al- Zaman, for that he had been friend and friendship hath its debtorship; yet he rejoiced in the dispelling of the doubts which had befallen him anent his wife, since the young man was now gone and his suspicions had not been stablished. Such was his case; but as regards Kamar al-Zaman, the young lady said to him, ""An thou wish for safety, travel with me by other than the wonted way."" And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Nine Hundred and Seventy-sixth Night,
She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Halimah said to Kamar al-Zaman, ""An thou wish for safety travel with me by other than the wonted way,"" he replied, ""Hearing and obeying;"" and, taking a road other than that used by folk, fared on without ceasing from region to region till he reached the confines of Egypt-land and sent his sire a letter by a runner. Now his father the merchant Abd al-Rahman was sitting in the market among the merchants, with a heart on fire for separation from his son, because no news of the youth had reached him since the day of his departure; and while he was in such case the runner came up and cried, ""O my lords, which of you is called the merchant Abd al-Rahman?"" They said, ""What wouldst thou of him?""; and he said, ""I have a letter for him from his son Kamar al-Zaman, whom I left at Al-Arísh."" At this Abd al-Rahman rejoiced and his breast was broadened and the merchants rejoiced for him and gave him joy of his son's safety. Then he opened the letter and read as follows, ""From Kamar al-Zaman to the merchant Abd al-Rahman. And after Peace be upon thee and upon all the merchants! An ye ask concerning us, to Allah be the praise and the thanks. Indeed we have sold and bought and gained and are come back in health, wealth and weal."" Whereupon Abd al-Rahman opened the door of rejoicing and made banquets and gave feasts and entertainments galore, sending for instruments of music and addressing himself to festivities after rarest fashion. When Kamar al-Zaman came to Al-Sálihiyah, his father and all the merchants went forth to meet him, and Abd al-Rahman embraced him and strained him to his bosom and sobbed till he swooned away. When he came to himself he said, ""Oh, 'tis a boon day O my son, whereon the Omnipotent Protector hath reunited us with thee!"" And he repeated the words of the bard,
""The return of the friend is the best of all boons, * And the joy
           cup circles o' morns and noons:
So well come, welcome, fair welcome to thee, * The light of the
          time and the moon o' full moons.""
Then, for excess of joy, he poured forth a flood of tears from his eyes and he recited also these two couplets,
""The Moon o' the Time, shows unveilèd light; * And, his
          journey done, at our door cloth alight:
His locks as the nights of his absence are black * And the sun
          upstands from his collar's white.""
Then the merchants came up to him and saluting him, saw with him many loads and servants and a travelling litter enclosed in a spacious circle. So they took him and carried him home; and when Halimah came forth from the litter, his father held her a seduction to all who beheld her. So they opened her an upper chamber, as it were a treasure from which the talismans had been loosed; and when his mother saw her, she was ravished with her and deemed her a Queen of the wives of the Kings. So she rejoiced in her and questioned her; and she answered, ""I am wife to thy son;"" and the mother rejoined, ""Since he is wedded to thee we must make thee a splendid marriage feast, that we may rejoice in thee and in my son."" On this wise it befel her; but as regards the merchant Abd al-Rahman, when the folk had dispersed and each had wended his way, he foregathered with his son and said to him, ""O my son, what is this slave-girl thou hast brought with thee and for how much didst thou buy her?"" Kamar al-Zaman said, ""O my father, she is no slave-girl; but 'tis she who was the cause of my going abroad."" Asked his sire, ""How so?""; and he answered, ""'Tis she whom the Dervish described to us the night he lay with us; for indeed my hopes crave to her from that moment and I sought not to travel save on account of her. The Arabs came out upon me by the way and stripped me and took my money and goods, so that I entered Bassorah alone and there befel me there such and such things;"" and he went on to relate to his parent all that had befallen him from commencement to conclusion. Now when he had made an end of his story, his father said to him, ""O my son, and after all this didst thou marry her?"" ""No; but I have promised her marriage."" ""Is it thine intent to marry her?"" ""An thou bid me marry her, I will do so; otherwise I will not marry her."" Thereupon quoth his father, ""An thou marry her, I am quit of thee in this world and in the next, and I shall be incensed against thee with sore indignation. How canst thou wed her, seeing that she hath dealt thus with her husband? For, even as she did with her spouse for thy sake, so will she do the like with thee for another's sake, because she is a traitress and in a traitor there is no trusting. Wherefore an thou disobey me, I shall be wroth with thee; but, an thou give ear to my word, I will seek thee out a girl handsomer than she, who shall be pure and pious, and marry thee to her, though I spend all my substance upon her; and I will make thee a wedding without equal and will glory in thee and in her; for 'tis better that folk should say, Such an one hath married such an one's daughter, than that they say, He hath wedded a slave-girl sans birth or worth."" And he went on to persuade his son to give up marrying her, by citing in support of his say, proofs, stories, examples, verses and moral instances, till Kamar al-Zaman exclaimed, ""O my father, since the case is thus, 'tis not right and proper that I marry her."" And when his father heard him speak on such wise, he kissed him between the eyes, saying, ""Thou art my very son, and as I live, O my son, I will assuredly marry thee to a girl who hath not her equal!"" Then the merchant set Obayd's wife and her handmaid in a chamber high up in the house and, before locking the door upon the twain, he appointed a black slave-girl to carry them their meat and drink and he said to Halimah, ""Ye shall abide imprisoned in this chamber, thou and thy maid, till I find one who will buy you, when I will sell you to him. An ye resist, I will slay ye both, for thou art a traitress, and there is no good in thee."" Answered she, ""Do thy will: I deserve all thou canst do with me."" Then he locked the door upon them and gave his Harim a charge respecting them, saying, ""Let none go up to them nor speak with them, save the black slave-girl who shall give them their meat and drink through the casement of the upper chamber."" So she abode with her maid, weeping and repenting her of that which she had done with her spouse. Meanwhile Abd al-Rahman sent out the marriage brokers to look out a maid of birth and worth for his son, and the women ceased not to make search, and as often as they saw one girl, they heard of a fairer than she, till they came to the house of the Shaykh al-Islam and saw his daughter. In her they found a virgin whose equal was not in Cairo for beauty and loveliness, symmetry and perfect grace, and she was a thousand fold handsomer than the wife of Obayd. So they told Abd al-Rahman of her and he and the notables repaired to her father and sought her in wedlock of him. Then they wrote out the marriage contract and made her a splendid wedding; after which Abd al-Rahman gave bride feasts and held open house forty days. On the first day, he invited the doctors of the law and they held a splendid nativity: and on the morrow, he invited all the merchants, and so on during the rest of the forty days, making a banquet every day to one or other class of folk, till he had bidden all the Olema and Emirs and Antients and Magistrates, whilst the kettle drums were drummed and the pipes were piped and the merchant sat to greet the guests, with his son by his side, that he might solace himself by gazing on the folk, as they ate from the trays. Each night Abd al-Rahman illuminated the street and the quarter with lamps and there came every one of the mimes and jugglers and mountebanks and played all manner play; and indeed it was a peerless wedding. On the last day he invited the Fakirs, the poor and the needy, far and near, and they flocked in troops and ate, whilst the merchant sat, with his son by his side. And among the paupers, behold, entered Shaykh Obayd the jeweller and he was naked and weary and bare on his face the marks of wayfare. When Kamar al-Zaman saw him, he knew him and said to his sire, ""Look, O my father, at yonder poor man who is but now come in by the door."" So he looked and saw him clad in worn clothes and on him a patched gown worth two dirhams: his face was yellow and he was covered with dust and was as he were an offcast of the pilgrims. He was groaning as groaneth a sick man in need, walking with a tottering gait and swaying now to the right and then to the left, and in him was realized his saying who said,
""Lack-gold abaseth man and cloth his worth away, Even as the
            setting sun that pales with ended day.
He passeth 'mongst the folk and fain would hide his head; And
            when alone, he weeps with tears that never stay.
Absent, none taketh heed to him or his concerns; Present, he hath
            no part in life or pleasance aye.
By Allah, whenas men with poverty are cursed, But strangers midst
            their kin and countrymen are they!""
And the saying of another,
""The poor man fares by everything opposed: * On him to shut the
            door Earth ne'er shall fail:
Thou seest men abhor him sans a sin, * And foes he finds tho none
            the cause can tell:
The very dogs, when sighting wealthy man, * Fawn at his feet and
            wag the flattering tail;
Yet, an some day a pauper loon they sight, * All at him bark and,
            gnashing fangs, assail.""
And how well quoth a third,
""If generous youth be blessed with luck and wealth, *
             Displeasures fly his path and perils fleet:
His enviers pimp for him and par'site-wise * E'en without tryst
           his mistress hastes to meet.
When loud he farts they say 'How well he sings!' * And when he
             fizzles cry they, 'Oh, how sweet!'""
—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Nine Hundred and Seventy-seventh Night,
She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when his son said to Abd al-Rahman, ""Look at yonder pauper!"" he asked, ""O my son, who is this?"" And Kamar al-Zaman answered, ""This is Master Obayd the jeweller, husband of the woman who is imprisoned with us."" Quoth Abd al-Rahman, ""Is this he of whom thou toldest me?""; and quoth his son, ""Yes; and indeed I wot him right well."" Now the manner of Obayd's coming thither was on this wise. When he had farewelled Kamar al-Zaman, he went to his shop and thence going home, laid his hand on the door whereupon it opened and he entered and found neither his wife nor the slave-girl, but saw the house in sorriest plight, quoting in mute speech his saying who said,
""The chambers were like a bee hive well stocked: * When their bees quitted it, they became empty.""
When he saw the house void, he turned right and left and presently went round about the place, like a madman, but came upon no one. Then he opened the door of his treasure closet, but found therein naught of his money nor his hoards; whereupon he recovered from the intoxication of fancy and shook off his infatuation and knew that it was his wife herself who had turned the tables upon him and outwitted him with her wiles. He wept for that which had befallen him, but kept his affair secret, so none of his foes might exult over him nor any of his friends be troubled, knowing that, if he disclosed his secret, it would bring him naught but dishonour and contumely from the folk; wherefore he said in him self, ""O Obayd, hide that which hath betided thee of affliction and ruination; it behoveth thee to do in accordance with his saying who said,
'If a man's breast with bane he hides be straitenèd, * The breast that tells its hidden bale is straiter still.' ""
Then he locked up his house and, making for his shop, gave it in charge of one of his apprentices to whom said he, ""My friend the young merchant hath invited me to accompany him to Cairo, for solacing ourselves with the sight of the city, and sweareth that he will not march except he carry us with him, me and my wife. So, O my son, I make thee my steward in the shop, and if the King ask for me, say thou to him, 'He is gone with his Harim to the Holy House of Allah.'"" Then he sold some of his effects and bought camels and mules and Mamelukes, together with a slave- girl, and placing her in a litter, set out from Bassorah after ten days. His friends farewelled him and none doubted but that he had taken his wife and gone on the Pilgrimage, and the folk rejoiced in this, for that Allah had delivered them from being shut up in the mosques and houses every Friday. Quoth some of them, ""Allah grant he may never return to Bassorah, so we may no more be boxed up in the mosques and houses every Friday!""; for that this usage had caused the people of Bassorah exceeding vexation. Quoth another, ""Methinks he will not return from this journey, by reason of the much praying of the people of Bassorah against him."" And yet another, ""An he return, 'twill not be but in reversed case."" So the folk rejoiced with exceeding joy in the jeweller's departure, after they had been in mighty great chagrin, and even their cats and dogs were comforted. When Friday came round, however, the crier proclaimed as usual that the people should repair to the mosques two hours before prayer time or else hide themselves in their houses, together with their cats and dogs; whereat their breasts were straitened and they assembled in general assembly and betaking themselves to the King's divan, stood between his hands and said, ""O King of the age, the jeweller hath taken his Harim and departed on the pilgrimage to the Holy House of Allah: so the cause of our restrains hath ceased to be, and why therefore are we now shut up?"" Quoth the King, ""How came this traitor to depart without telling me? But, when he cometh back from his journey, all will not be save well: so go ye to your shops and sell and buy, for this vexation is removed from you."" Thus far concerning the King and the Bassorites; but as for the jeweller, he fared on ten days' journey, and as he drew near Baghdad, there befel him that which had befallen Kamar al-Zaman, before his entering Bassorah; for the Arabs came out upon him and stripped him and took all he had and he escaped only by feigning himself dead. As soon as they were gone, he rose and fared on, naked as he was, till he came to a village, where Allah inclined to him the hearts of certain kindly folk, who covered his shame with some old clothes; and he asked his way, begging from town to town, till he reached the city of Cairo the God guarded. There, burning with hunger, he went about alms seeking in the market streets, till one of the townsfolk said to him, ""O poor man, off with thee to the house of the wedding festival and eat and drink; for to day there is open table for paupers and strangers."" Quoth he, ""I know not the way thither"": and quoth the other, ""Follow me and I will show it to thee."" He followed him, till he brought him to the house of Abd al-Rahman and said to him, ""This is the house of the wedding; enter and fear not, for there is no doorkeeper at the door of the festival."" Accordingly he entered and Kamar al- Zaman knew him and told his sire who said, ""O my son, leave him at this present: belike he is anhungered: so let him eat his sufficiency and recover himself and after we will send for him."" So they waited till Obayd had eaten his fill and washed his hands and drunk coffee and sherbets of sugar flavoured with musk and ambergris and was about to go out, when Abd al-Rahman sent after him a page who said to him, ""Come, O stranger, and speak with the merchant Abd al-Rahman."" ""Who is he?"" asked Obayd; and the man answered, ""He is the master of the feast."" Thereupon the jeweller turned back, thinking that he meant to give him a gift, and coming up to Abd al-Rahman, saw his friend Kamar al-Zaman and went nigh to lose his senses for shame before him. But Kamar al- Zaman rose to him and embracing him, saluted him with the salam, and they both wept with sore weeping. Then he seated him by his side and Abd al-Rahman said to his son, ""O destitute of good taste, this is no way to receive friends! Send him first to the Hammam and despatch after him a suit of clothes of the choicest, worth a thousand dinars."" Accordingly they carried him to the bath, where they washed his body and clad him in a costly suit, and he became as he were Consul of the Merchants. Meanwhile the bystanders questioned Kamar al-Zaman of him, saying, ""Who is this and whence knowest thou him?"" Quoth he, ""This is my friend, who lodged me in his house and to whom I am indebted for favours without number, for that he entreated me with exceeding kindness. He is a man of competence and condition and by trade a jeweller, in which craft he hath no equal. The King of Bassorah loveth him dearly and holdeth him in high honour and his word is law with him."" And he went on to enlarge before them on his praises, saying, ""Verily, he did with me thus and thus and I have shame of him and know not how to requite him his generous dealing with me."" Nor did he leave to extol him, till his worth was magnified to the bystanders and he became venerable in their eyes; so they said, ""We will all do him his due and honour him for thy sake. But we would fain know the reason why he hath departed his native land and the cause of his coming hither and what Allah hath done with him, that he is reduced to this plight?"" Replied Kamar al- Zaman, ""O folk, marvel not, for a son of Adam is still subject to Fate and Fortune, and what while he abideth in this world, he is not safe from calamities. Indeed he spake truly who said these couplets,
The world tears man to shreds, so be thou not * Of those whom
           lure of rank and title draws:
Nay; 'ware of slips and turn from sin aside * And ken that bane
           and bale are worldly laws:
How oft high Fortune falls by least mishap * And all things bear
            inbred of change a cause!'
Know that I entered Bassorah in yet iller case and worse distress than this man, for that he entered Cairo with his shame hidden by rags; but I indeed came into his town with my nakedness uncovered, one hand behind and another before; and none availed me but Allah and this dear man. Now the reason of this was that the Arabs stripped me and took my camels and mules and loads and slaughtered my pages and serving men; but I lay down among the slain and they thought that I was dead, so they went away and left me. Then I arose and walked on, mother naked, till I came to Bassorah where this man met me and clothed me and lodged me in his house, he also furnished me with money, and all I have brought back with me I owe to none save to Allah's goodness and his goodness. When I departed, he gave me great store of wealth and I returned to the city of my birth with a heart at ease. I left him in competence and condition, and haply there hath befallen him some bale of the banes of Time, that hath forced him to quit his kinsfolk and country, and there happened to him by the way the like of what happened to me. There is nothing strange in this; but now it behoveth me to requite him his noble dealing with me and do according to the saying of him who saith,
'O who praises"" Time with the fairest appraise, * Knowest thou
            what Time hath made and unmade?
What thou dost at least be it kindly done, * For with pay
            he pays shall man be repaid.'""
As they were talking and telling the tale, behold, up came Obayd as he were Consul of the Merchants; whereupon they all rose to salute him and seated him in the place of honour. Then said Kamar al-Zaman to him, ""O my friend, verily, thy day is blessed and fortunate! There is no need to relate to me a thing that befel me before thee. If the Arabs have stripped thee and robbed thee of thy wealth, verily our money is the ransom of our bodies, so let not thy soul be troubled; for I entered thy city naked and thou clothedst me and entreatedst me generously, and I owe thee many a kindness. But I will requite thee.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say,
When it was the Nine Hundred and Seventy-eighth Night,
She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al-Zaman said to Master Obayd the jeweller, ""Verily I entered thy city naked and thou clothedst me and I owe thee many a kindness. But I will requite thee and do with thee even as thou didst with me; nay, more: so be of good cheer and eyes clear of tear."" And he went on to soothe him and hinder him from speech, lest he should name his wife and what she had done with him nor did he cease to ply him with saws and moral instances and verses and conceits and stories and legends and console him, till the jeweller saw his drift and took the hint and kept silence concerning the past, diverting himself with the tales and rare anecdotes he heard and repeating in himself these lines,
""On the brow of the World is a writ; an thereon thou look, * Its
            contents will compel thine eyes tears of blood to rain:
For the World never handed to humans a cup with its right, * But
            with left it compelled them a beaker of ruin to drain.""
Then Kamar al-Zaman and his father took Obayd and carrying him into the saloon of the Harim, shut themselves up with him; and Abd al-Rahman said to him, ""We did not hinder thee from speaking before the folk, but for fear of dishonour to thee and to us: but now we are private; so tell me all that hath passed between thee and thy wife and my son."" So he told him all, from beginning to end, and when he had made an end of his story, Abd al-Rahman asked him, ""Was the fault with my son or with thy wife?"" He answered, ""By Allah, thy son was not to blame, for men must needs lust after women, and 'tis the bounder duty of women to defend themselves from men. So the sin lieth with my wife, who played me false and did with me these deeds."" Then Abd al-Rahman arose and taking his son aside, said to him, ""O my son, we have proved his wife and know her to be a traitress; and now I mean to prove him and see if he be a man of honour and manliness, or a wittol."" ""How so?"" asked Kamar al-Zaman; and Abd al- Rahman answered, ""I mean to urge him to make peace with his wife, and if he consent thereto and forgive her, I will smite him with a sword and slay him and kill her after, her and her maid, for there is no good in the life of a cuckold and a queen; but, if he turn from her with aversion I will marry him to thy sister and give him more of wealth than that thou tookest from him."" Then he went back to Obayd and said to him, ""O master, verily, the commerce of women requireth patience and magnanimity and whoso loveth them hath need of fortitude, for that they order themselves viper wise towards men and evilly entreat them, by reason of their superiority over them in beauty and loveliness: wherefore they magnify themselves and belittle men. This is notably the case when their husbands show them affection; for then they requite them with hauteur and coquetry and harsh dealing of all kinds. But, if a man be wroth whenever he seeth in his wife aught that offendeth him, there can be no fellowship between them; nor can any hit it off with them who is not magnanimous and long suffering; and unless a man bear with his wife and requite her foul doing with forgiveness, he shall get no good of her conversation. Indeed, it hath been said of them, 'Were they in the sky, the necks of men would incline themwards'; and he who hath the power and pardoneth, his reward is with Allah. Now this woman is thy wife and thy companion and she hath long consorted with thee; wherefore it behoveth that thou entreat her with indulgence which in fellowship is of the essentials of success. Furthermore, women fail in wit and Faith, and if she have sinned, she repenteth and Inshallah she will not again return to that which she whilome did. So 'tis my rede that thou make peace with her and I will restore thee more than the good she took; and if it please thee to abide with me, thou art welcome, thou and she, and ye shall see naught but what shall joy you both; but, an thou seek to, return to thine own land. For that which falleth out between a man and his wife is manifold, and it behoveth thee to be indulgent and not take the way of the violent."" Said the jeweller, ""O my lord, and where is my wife?"" and said Abd al-Rahman, ""She is in that upper chamber, go up to her and be easy with her, for my sake, and trouble her not; for, when my son brought her hither, he would have married her, but I forbade him from her and shut her up in yonder room, and locked the door upon her saying in myself, 'Haply her husband will come and I will hand her over to him safe; for she is fair of favour, and when a woman is like unto this one, it may not be that her husband will let her go.' What I counted on is come about and praised be Allah Almighty for thy reunion with thy wife! As for my son, I have sought him another woman in marriage and have married him to her: these banquets and rejoicings are for his wedding, and to-night I bring him to his bride. So here is the key of the chamber where thy wife is: take it and open the door and go in to her and her handmaid and be buxom with her. There shall be brought you meat and drink and thou shalt not come down from her till thou have had thy fill of her."" Cried Obayd, ""May Allah requite thee for me with all good, O my lord!"" and taking the key, went up, rejoicing. The other thought his words had pleased him and that he consented thereto; so he took the sword and following him unseen, stood to espy what should happen between him and his wife. This is how it fared with the merchant Abd al-Rahman; but as for the jeweller, when he came to the chamber door, he heard his wife weeping with sore weeping for that Kamar al-Zaman had married another than her, and the handmaid saying to her, ""O my lady, how often have I warned thee and said, 'Thou wilt get no good of this youth: so do thou leave his company.' But thou heededst not my words and spoiledst thy husband of all his goods and gayest them to him. After the which thou forsookest thy place, of thine fondness and infatuation for him, and camest with him to this country. And now he hath cast thee out from his thought and married another and hath made the issue of thy foolish fancy for him to be durance vile."" Cried Halimah, ""Be silent, O accursed! Though he be married to another, yet some day needs must I occur to his thought. I cannot forget the nights I have spent in his company and in any case I console myself with his saying who said,
'O my lords, shall he to your mind occur * Who recurs to you only
             sans other mate?
Grant Heaven you ne'er shall forget his state * Who for state of
            you forgot own estate!'
It cannot be but he will bethink him of my affect and converse and ask for me, wherefore I will not turn from loving him nor change from passion for him, though I perish in prison; for he is my love and my leach and my reliance is on him that he will yet return to me and deal fondly with me."" When the jeweller heard his wife's words, he went in to her and said to her, ""O traitress, thy hope in him is as the hope of Iblis in Heaven. All these vices were in thee and I knew not thereof; for, had I been ware of one single vice, I had not kept thee with me an hour. But now I am certified of this in thee, it behoveth me to do thee die although they put me to death for thee, O traitress!"" and he clutched her with both hands and repeated these two couplets,
""O fair ones forth ye cast my faithful love * With sin, nor had
            ye aught regard for right:
How long I fondly clung to you, but now * My love is loathing and
            I hate your sight.""
Then he pressed hardly upon her windpipe and brake her neck, whereupon her handmaid cried out ""Alas, my mistress!"" Said he, ""O harlot, 'tis thou who art to blame for all this, for that thou knewest this evil inclination to be in her and toldest me not."" Then he seized upon her and strangled her. All this happened while Abd al-Rahman stood, brand in hand, behind the door espying with his eyes and hearing with his ears. Now when Obayd the ]eweller had done this, apprehension came upon him and he feared the issue of his affair and said to himself, ""As soon as the merchant learneth that I have killed them in his house, he will surely slay me; yet I beseech Allah that He appoint the taking of my life to be while I am in the True Belief!"" And he abode bewildered about his case and knew not what to do, but, as he was thus behold, in came Abd al-Rahman from his lurking place without the door and said to him, ""No harm shall befal thee, for indeed thou deserves"" safety. See this sword in my hand. 'Twas in my mind to slay thee, hadst thou made peace with her and restored her to favour, and I would also have slain her and the maid. But since thou hast done this deed, welcome to thee and again welcome! And I will reward thee by marrying thee to my daughter, Kamar al-Zaman's sister."" Then he carried him down and sent for the woman who washed the dead: whereupon it was bruited abroad that Kamar al-Zaman had brought with him two slave-girls from Bassorah and that both had deceased. So the people began to condole with him saying, ""May thy head live!"" and ""May Allah compensate thee!"" And they washed and shrouded them and buried them, and none knew the truth of the matter. Then Abd al-Rahman sent for the Shaykh al-Islam and all the notables and said, ""O Shaykh, draw up the contract of marriage between my daughter Kaukab al-Salah and Master Obayd the jeweller and set down that her dowry hath been paid to me in full."" So he wrote out the contract and Abd al-Rahman gave the company to drink of sherbets, and they made one wedding festival for the two brides the daughter of the Shaykh al-Islam and Kamar al-Zaman's sister; and paraded them in one litter on one and the same night; after which they carried Kamar al-Zaman and Obayd in procession together and brought them in to their brides. When the jeweller went in to Abd al-Rahman's daughter, he found her handsomer than Halimah and a thousand fold lovelier. So he took her maidenhead and on the morrow, he went to the Hammam with Kamar al-Zaman. Then he abode with them awhile in pleasance and joyance, after which he began to yearn for his native land; so he went in to Abd al-Rahman and said to him, ""O uncle, I long for my own country, for I have there estates and effects, which I left in charge of one of my prentices; and I am minded to journey thither that I may sell my properties and return to thee. So wilt thou give me leave to go to my country for that purpose?"" Answered the merchant, ""O my son, I give thee leave to do this and there be no fault in thee or blame to thee for these words, for 'Love of mother land is a part of Religion'; and he who hath not good in his own country hath none in other folks' country. But, haply, an thou depart without thy wife, when thou art once come to thy native place, it may seem good to thee to settle there, and thou wilt be perplexed between returning to thy wife and sojourning in thine own home; so it were the righter rede that thou carry thy wife with thee; and after, an thou desire to return to us, return and welcome to you both; for we are folk who know not divorce and no woman of us marrieth twice, nor do we lightly discard a man."" Quoth Obayd, ""Uncle, I fear me thy daughter will not consent to journey with me to my own country."" Replied Abd al-Rahman, ""O my son, we have no women amongst us who gainsay their spouses, nor know we a wife who is wroth with her man."" The jeweller cried, ""Allah bless you and your women!"" and going in to his wife, said to her, ""I am minded to go to my country: what sayst thou?"" Quoth she, ""Indeed, my sire had the ordering of me, whilst I was a maid, and when I married, the ordering all passed into the hands of my lord and master, nor will I gainsay him."" Quoth Obayd, ""Allah bless thee and thy father, and have mercy on the womb that bare thee and the loins that begat thee!"" Then he cut his thongs and applied himself to making ready for his journey. His father-in- law gave him much good and they took leave each of other, after which tile jeweller and his wife journeyed on without ceasing, till they reached Bassorah where his kinsmen and comrades came out to meet him, doubting not but that he had been in Al-Hijaz. Some rejoiced at his return, whilst others were vexed, and the folk said one to another, ""Now will he straiten us again every Friday, as before, and we shall be shut up in the mosques and houses, even to our cats and our dogs."" On such wise it fared with him; but as regards the King of Bassorah, when he heard of his return, he was wroth with him; and sending for him, upbraided him and said to him, ""Why didst thou depart, without letting me know of thy departure? Was I unable to give thee somewhat wherewith thou mightest have succoured thyself in thy pilgrimage to the Holy House of Allah?"" Replied the jeweller, ""Pardon, O my lord! By Allah, I went not on the pilgrimage! but there have befallen me such and such things."" Then he told him all that had befallen him with his wife and with Abd al-Rahman of Cairo and how the merchant had given him his daughter to wife, ending with these words, ""And I have brought her to Bassorah."" Said the King, ""By the Lord, did I not fear Allah the Most High, I would slay thee and marry this noble lady after thy death, though I spent on her mints of money, because she befitteth none but Kings. But Allah hath appointed her of thy portion and may He bless thee in her! So look thou use her well."" Then he bestowed largesse on the jeweller, who went out from before him and abode with his wife five years, after which he was admitted to the mercy of the Almighty. Presently the King sought his widow in wedlock; but she refused, saying, ""O King, never among my kindred was a woman who married again after her husband's death; wherefore I will never take another husband, nor will I marry thee, no, though thou kill me."" Then he sent to her one who said, ""Dost thou seek to go to thy native land?"" And she answered, ""An thou do good, thou shalt be requited therewith."" So he collected for her all the jeweller's wealth and added unto her of his own, after the measure of his degree. Lastly he sent with her one of his Wazirs, a man famous for goodness and piety, and an escort of five hundred horse, who journeyed with her, till they brought her to her father; and in his home she abode, without marrying again, till she died and they died all. So, if this woman would not consent to replace her dead husband with a Sultan, how shall she be compared with one who replaced her husband, whilst he was yet alive, with a youth of unknown extraction and condition, and especially when this was in lewd carriage and not by way of lawful marriage? So he who deemeth all women alike, there is no remedy for the disease of his insanity. And glory be to Him to whom belongeth the empire of the Seen and the Unseen and He is the Living, who dieth not! And among the tales they tell, O auspicious King, is one of

Footnotes:


 Lane rejects this tale because it is ""extremely objectionable; far more so than the title might lead me to expect."" But he quotes the following marginal note by his Shaykh: —""Many persons (women) reckon marrying a second time amongst the most disgraceful of actions. This opinion is commonest in the country-towns and villages; and my mother's relations are thus distinguished; so that a woman of them, when her husband dieth or divorceth her while she is young, passeth in widowhood her life, however long it may be, and disdaineth to marry a second time."" I fear that this state of things belongs to the good old days now utterly gone by; and the loose rule of the stranger, especially the English, in Egypt will renew the scenes which characterised Sind when Sir Charles Napier hanged every husband who cut down an adulterous wife. I have elsewhere noticed the ignorant idea that Moslems deny to women souls and seats in Paradise, whilst Mohammed canonised two women in his own family. The theory arose with the ""Fathers"" of the Christian Church who simply exaggerated the misogyny of St. Paul. St. Ambrose commenting on Corinthians i. ii., boldly says:—""Feminas ad imaginem Dei factas non esse."" St. Thomas Aquinas and his school adopted the Aristotelian view, ""Mulier est erratum naturae, et mas occasionatus, et per accidens generatur; atque ideo est monstrum."" For other instances see Bayle s. v. Gediacus (Revd. Simon of Brandebourg) who in 1695 published a ""Defensio Sexus muliebris,"" a refutation of an anti-Socinian satire or squib, ""Disputatio perjucunda, Mulieres homines non esse,"" Parisiis, 1693. But when Islam arose in the seventh century, the Christian learned cleverly affixed the stigma of their own misogyny upon the Moslems ad captandas foeminas and in Southern Europe the calumny still bears fruit. Mohammed (Koran, chapt. xxiv.) commands for the first time, in the sixth year of his mission, the veiling and, by inference, the seclusion of women, which was apparently unknown to the Badawin and, if practised in the cities was probably of the laxest. Nor can one but confess that such modified separation of the sexes, which it would be impossible to introduce into European manners, has great and notable advantages. It promotes the freest intercourse between man and man, and thus civilises what we call the ""lower orders"": in no Moslem land, from Morocco to China, do we find the brutals without manners or morals which are bred by European and especially by English civilisation. For the same reason it enables women to enjoy fullest intimacy and friendship with one another, and we know that the best of both sexes are those who prefer the society of their own as opposed to ""quite the lady's man"" and ""quite the gentleman's woman."" It also adds an important item to social decorum by abolishing e.g. such indecencies as the ""ball-room flirtation""—a word which must be borrowed from us, not translated by foreigners. And especially it gives to religious meetings, a tone which the presence of women modifies and not for the better. Perhaps, the best form is that semiseclusion of the sex, which prevailed in the heroic ages of Greece, Rome, and India (before the Moslem invasion), and which is perpetuated in Christian Armenia and in modern Hellas. It is a something between the conventual strictness of Al-Islam and the liberty, or rather licence, of the ""Anglo-Saxon"" and the ""Anglo-American."" And when England shall have cast off that peculiar insularity which makes her differ from all civilised peoples, she will probably abolish three gross abuses, time-honoured scandals, which bear very heavily on women and children. The first is the Briton's right to will property away from his wife and offspring. The second is the action for ""breach of promise,"" salving the broken heart with pounds, shillings, and pence: it should be treated simply as an exaggerated breach of contract. The third is the procedure popularly called ""Crim. Con.,"" and this is the most scandalous of all: the offence is against the rights of property, like robbery or burglary, and it ought to be treated criminally with fine, imprisonment and in cases with corporal punishment after the sensible procedure of Moslem law.
 ""Moon of the age,"" a name which has before occurred.
 The Malocchio or gettatura, so often noticed.
 The crescent of the month Zu 'l-Ka'dah when the Ramazan-fast is broken. This allusion is common. Comp. vol. i. 84.
 This line contains one of the Yes, Yes and No, No trifles alluded to in vol. ii, 60. Captain Lockett (M. A. 103) renders it ""I saw a fawn upon a hillock whose beauty eclipsed the full moon. I said, What is thy name? she answered Deer. What my Dear said I, but she replied, no, no!"" To preserve the sound I have sacrificed sense: Lulu is a pearl, Li? li? (= for me, for me?) and La! La! = no! no! See vol. i, 217. I should have explained a line which has puzzled some readers,
""A sun (face) on wand (neck) in knoll of sand (hips) she showed"" etc,
 Arab. ""Al-huwayna,"" a rare term.

 Mr. Payne reads ""Maghrabi"" = a Mauritanian, Maroccan, the Moors (not the Moorish Jews or Arabs) being a race of Sodomites from highest to lowest. But the Mac. and Bul. Edit. have ""Ajami.""
 For ""Ishk uzri"" = platonic love see vol. i. 232; ii. 104.
 Zaynab (Zenobia) and Zayd are generic names for women and men.
 i.e. He wrote ""Kasidahs"" (= odes, elegies) after the fashion of the ""Suspended Poems"" which mostly open with the lover gazing upon the traces of the camp where his beloved had dwelt. The exaggerated conventionalism of such exordium shows that these early poems had been preceded by a host of earlier pieces which had been adopted as canons of poetry.
 The verses are very mal-a-propos, like many occurring in The Nights, for the maligned Shaykh is proof against all the seductions of the pretty boy and falls in love with a woman after the fashion of Don Quixote. Mr. Payne complains of the obscurity of the original owing to abuse of the figure enallage; but I find them explicit enough, referring to some debauched elder after the type of Abu Nowas.
 Arab. ""'Irk"" = a root which must here mean a sprig, a twig. The basil grows to a comparatively large size in the East.
 Arab. ""Lait ""= one connected with the tribe of Lot, see vol. v. 161.
 For the play upon ""Saki"" (oblique case of sak, leg-calf) and Saki a cupbearer see vol. ii. 327.
 ""On a certain day the leg shall be bared and men shall be called upon to bow in adoration, but they shall not be able"" (Koran, lxviii. 42). ""Baring the leg"" implies a grievous calamity, probably borrowed from the notion of tucking up the skirts and stripping for flight. On the dangerous San Francisco River one of the rapids is called ""Tira-calcoens"" = take off your trousers (Highlands of the Brazil, ii. 35). But here the allusion is simply ludicrous and to a Moslem blasphemous.
 Arab. ""Istahi,"" a word of every day use in reproof. So the Hindost. ""Kuchh sharm nahin?"" hast thou no shame? Shame is a passion with Orientals and very little known to the West.
 i.e. Angels and men saying, ""The Peace (of God) be on us and on all righteous servants of Allah!"" This ends every prayer.
 Arab. ""Al-Niyah,"" the ceremonial purpose or intent to pray, without which prayer is null and void. See vol. v. 163. The words would be ""I purpose to pray a two-bow prayer in this hour of deadly danger to my soul."" Concerning such prayer see vol. i. 142.
 Arab. ""Sakin"" = quiescent, Let a sleeping hound lie.
 Arab. ""Asar"" lit. traces i.e. the works, the mighty signs and marvels.
 The mention of coffee now frequently occurs in this tale and in that which follows: the familiar use of it showing a comparatively late date, and not suggesting the copyist's hand.
 Arab. ""Al-Kahwah,"" the place being called from its produce. See Pilgrimage i. 317-18.
 Arab. ""Al-Ghurbah Kurbah:"" the translation in the text is taken from my late friend Edward Eastwick, translator of the Gulistan and author of a host of works which show him to have been a ripe Oriental scholar.
 The fiction may have been suggested by the fact that in all Moslem cities from India to Barbary the inner and outer gates are carefully shut during the noontide devotions, not ""because Friday is the day on which creation was finished and Mohammed entered Al-Medinah;"" but because there is a popular idea that in times now approaching the Christians will rise up against the Moslems during prayers and will repeat the ""Sicilian Vespers.""

 About three pennyweights. It varies, however, everywhere and in Morocco the ""Mezkal"" as they call it is an imaginary value, no such coin existing.
 i.e. over and above the value of the gold, etc.
 This was the custom of contemporary Europe and more than one master cutler has put to death an apprentice playing Peeping Tom to detect the secret of sword-making.
 Among Moslems husbands are divided into three species; (1) of ""Bahr"" who is married for love; (2) of ""Dahr,"" for defence against the world, and (3) of ""Mahr"" for marriage-settlements (money). Master Obayd was an unhappy compound of the two latter; but he did not cease to be a man of honour.
The Mac. Edit. here is a mass of blunders and misprints.
 The Mac. Edit. everywhere calls her ""Sabiyah"" = the young lady and does not mention her name Halimah = the Mild, the Gentle till the cmlxxivth Night. I follow Mr. Payne's example by introducing it earlier into the story, as it avoids vagueness and repetition of the indefinite.
 Arab ""Adím al-Zauk,""=without savour. applied to an insipid mannerless man as ""bárid"" (cold) is to a fool. ""Ahl Zauk"" is a man of pleasure, a voluptuary, a hedonist.
 Arab. ""Finján"" the egg-shell cups from which the
Easterns still drink coffee.
 Arab. ""Awáshik"" a rare word, which Dozy translates ""osselet"" (or osselle) and Mr. Payne, ""hucklebones,"" concerning which he has obliged me with this note. Chambaud renders osselet by ""petit os avec lequel les enfants jouent."" Hucklebone is the hip-bone but in the plural it applies to our cockals or cockles: Latham gives ""hucklebone,"" (or cockal), one of the small vertebræ of the coccygis, and Littleton translates ""Talus,"" a hucklebone, a bone to play with like a dye, a play called cockal. (So also in Rider.) Hucklebones and knucklebones are syn.: but the latter is modern and liable to give a false idea, besides being tautological. It has nothing to do with the knuckles and derives from the German ""Knochel"" (dialectically Knochelein) a bonelet.
 For ablution after sleep and before prayer. The address of the slave-girl is perfectly natural: in a Moslem house we should hear it this day, nor does it show the least sign of ""frowardness. ""

 This is a rechauffé of the Language of Signs in ""Azíz and Azízah"" vol. ii. 302.
 In the Mac. Edit. ""Yá Fulánah""=O certain person.
 Arab. ""Laylat al-Kábilah,"" lit.=the coming night, our to-night; for which see vol. iii. 349.
 Arab. ""Ya Ahmak!"" which in Marocco means a madman, a maniac, a Santon.
 The whole passage has a grammatical double entendre whose application is palpable. Harf al-Jarr=a particle governing the noun in the genitive or a mode of thrusting and tumbling.
 Arab. ""Al-Silah"" =conjunctive (sentence), also coition; Al-Mausúl= the conjoined, a grammatical term for relative pronoun or particle.
 Arab. ""Tanwin al-Izafah ma'zul"" = the nunnation in construction cast out. ""Tanwin"" (nunnation) is pronouncing the vowels of the case-endings of a noun with n un for u (nominative) in for i (genitive) and an for a (accusative). This nunnation expresses indefiniteness, e.g. ""Malikun""=a king, any king. When the noun is made definite by the Ma'rifah or article (al), the Tanwin must be dropped, e.g. Al-Maliku = the King; Al- Malikun being a grammatical absurdity. In construction or regimen (izafah) the nunnation must also disappear, as Maliku 'I-Hind) = the King of Hind (a King of Hind would be Malikun min Muluki 'I-Hind) = a King from amongst the Kings of Hind). Thus whilst the wife and the lover were conjoined as much as might be, the hocussed and sleeping husband was dismissed (ma'zul=degraded) like a nunnation dropped in construction. I may add that the terminal syllables are invariably dropped in popular parlance and none but Mr. G. Palgrave (who afterwards ignored his own assertion) ever found an Arab tribe actually using them in conversation although they are always pronounced when reading the Koran and poetry.
 This was a saying of Mohammed about overfrequency of visits, ""Zur ghibban, tazid hubban""=call rarely that friendship last fairly. So the verse of Al-Mutanabbi,
""How oft familiarity breeds dislike.""
Preston quotes Jesus ben Sirach, {Greek}. Also Al-Hariri (Ass. xv. of ""The Legal""; De Sacy p. 478 1. 2.) ""Visit not your friend more than one day in a month, nor stop longer than that with him!"" Also Ass. xvi. 487, 8. ""Multiply not visits to thy friend."" ""None so disliked as one visiting too often."" (Preston p. 352). In the Cent nouvelles (52) Nouvelles (No. lii.) the dying father says to his son:—""Jamais ne vous hantez tent en l'ostel de votre voisin que lion vous y serve de pain bis."" In these matters Moslems follow the preaching and practice of the Apostle, who was about as hearty and genial as the ""Great Washington."" But the Arab had a fund of dry humour which the Anglo-American lacked altogether.
 Arab. ""'Amal""—action, operation. In Hindostani it is used (often with an Alif for an Ayn) as intoxication e.g. Amal pání strong waters and applied to Sharáb (wine), Bozah (Beer), Tádí (toddy or the fermented juice of the Tád, Borassus flabelliformis), Naryáli (juice of the cocoa-nut tree) Saynddi (of the wild date, Elate Sylvestris), Afyún (opium an its preparations as post=poppy seeds) and various forms of Cannabis Sativa, as Ganja, Charas, Madad, Sahzi etc. for which see Herklots' Glossary.
 Arab ""Sardáb,"" mostly an underground room (vol. i. 340) but here a tunnel.
 Arab. ""Al-Láwandiyah"": this and the frequent mention of coffee and presently of a watch (sa'ah) show that the tale in its present state, cannot be older than the end of the sixteenth century.
 Arab. ""Su'bán,"" vol. i. 172.
 The lines have occurred in vol. i. 238, where I have noted the punning ""Sabr""= patience or aloes. I quote Torrens: the Templar, however, utterly abolishes the pun in the last couplet:- -
""The case is not at my command, but in fair Patience hand
I'm set by Him who order'th all and cloth such case command.""
""Amr"" here=case (circumstance) or command (order) with a suspicion of reference to Murr=myrrh, bitterness. The reader will note the resignation to Fate's decrees which here and in host of places elevates the tone of the book.
 i.e. as one loathes that which is prohibited, and with a loathing which makes it unlawful for me to cohabit with thee.
 This is quite natural to the sensitive Eastern.
 Hence, according to Moslem and Eastern theory generally her lewd and treasonable conduct. But in Egypt not a few freeborn women and those too of the noblest, would beat her hollow at her own little game. See for instance the booklet attributed to Jalál al-Siyútí and entitled Kitáh al-Ízáh (Book of Explanation) fí Ilm al-Nikáh (in the Science of Carnal Copulation). There is a copy of it in the British Museum; and a friend kindly suppl~ed me with a lithograph from Cairo; warning me that there are doubts about the authorship.
 These lines have occurred in vol. iii. 214: I quote Mr.
Payne.
 This ejaculation, as the waw shows, is parenthetic; spoken either by Halimah, by Shahrazad or by the writer.
 Arab. ""Kasr"" here meaning an upper room.
 To avoid saying, I pardon thee.
 A proverbial saying which here means I could only dream of such good luck.
 A good old custom amongst Moslems who have had business transactions with each other: such acquittance of all possible claims will be quoted on ""Judgment-Day,"" when debts will be severely enquired into.
 Arab. ""Kutr (tract or quarter) Misr,"" vulgarly pronounced ""Masr."" I may remind the reader that the Assyrians called the Nile-valley ""Musur"" whence probably the Heb. Misraim a dual form denoting Upper and Lower Egypt which are still distinguished by the Arabs into Sa'id and Misr. The hieroglyphic term is Ta-mera=Land of the Flood; and the Greek Aigyptos is probably derived from Kahi-Ptah (region of the great God Ptah) or Ma Ka Ptah (House of the soul of Ptah). The word ""Cops"" or ""Kopt,"" in Egyptian ""Kubti"" and pronounced ""Gubti,"" contains the same consonants
 Now an unimportant frontier fort and village dividing Syria-Palestine from Egypt and famed for the French battle with the Mamelukes (Feb. 19, 1799) and the convention for evacuating Egypt. In the old times it was an important site built upon the ""River of Egypt"" now a dried up Wady; and it was the chief port of the then populous Najab or South Country. According to Abulfeda it derived its name (the ""boothy,"" the nest) from a hut built there by the brothers of Joseph when stopped at the frontier by the guards of Pharaoh. But this is usual Jewish infection of history.
 Arab. ""Báb."" which may also=""Chapter"" or category. See vol. i., 136 and elsewhere (index). In Egypt ""Báb"" sometimes means a sepulchral cave hewn in a rock (plur. Bíbán) from the Coptic ""Bíb.""
 i.e. ""The Holy,"" a town some three marches (60 miles) N. East of Cairo; thus showing the honour done to our unheroic hero. There is also a Sálihlyah quarter or suburb of Damascus famous for its cemetery of holy men, but the facetious Cits change the name to Zálliniyah=causing to stray; in allusion to its Kurdish population. Baron von Hammer reads ""le faubourg Adelieh"" built by Al-Malik Al-Adil and founded a chronological argument on a clerical error.
 Kamar al-Zaman; the normal pun on the name; a practice as popular in the East as in the West, and worthy only of a pickpocket in either place.
 Arab. ""Azrár"" plur. of ""Zirr"" and lit. = 'buttons,"" i.e. of his robe collar from which his white neck and face appear shining as the sun.
 Arab. ""Dáirah"" the usual inclosure of Kanáts or tent-flaps pitched for privacy during the halt.
 i.e. it was so richly ornamented that it resembled an enchanted hoard whose spells, hiding it from sight, had been broken by some happy treasure seeker.
 The merchant who is a ""stern parent"" and exceedingly ticklish on the Pundonor saw at first sight her servile origin which had escaped the mother. Usually it is the other way.
 Not the head of the Church, or Chief Pontiff, but the Chief of the Olema and Fukahá (Fákihs or D.D.'s.) men learned in the Law (divinity). The order is peculiarly Moslem, in fact the succedaneum for the Christian ""hierarchy "" an institution never contemplated by the Founder of Christianity. This title shows the modern date of the tale.
 Arab. ""Maulid,"" prop. applied to the Birth-feast of Mohammed which begins on the 3rd day of Rabí al-Awwal (third Moslem month) and lasts a week or ten days (according to local custom), usually ending on the 12th and celebrated with salutes of cannon, circumcision feasts. marriage banquets. Zikr-litanies, perfections of the Koran and all manner of solemn festivities including the ""powder-play"" (Láb al-Bárút) in the wilder corners of Al-Islam. It is also applied to the birth-festivals of great Santons (as Ahmad al- Badawi) for which see Lane M. E. chaps. xxiv. In the text it is used like the Span. ""Funcion"" or the Hind ""Tamáshá,"" any great occasion of merry-making.
 Arab. ""Sanájik"" Plur. of Sanjak (Turk.) = a banner, also applied to the bearer (ensign or cornet) and to a military rank mostly corresponding with Bey or Colonel.
 I have followed Mr. Payne's ordering of the text which, both in the Mac. and Bull. Edits., is wholly inconsequent and has not the excuse of rhyme.
 Arab. ""Jilbáb,"" a long coarse veil or gown which in Barbary becomes a ""Jallábiyah,"" in a striped and hooded cloak of woollen stuff.
 i.e. a broken down pilgrim left to die on the road.
 These lines have occurred in vol. i. 272. I quote Mr.
Payne.
 Note the difference between ""Zirt,"" the loud crepitus
and ""Faswah"" the susurrus which Captain Grose in his quaint
""Lexicum Balatronicum,"" calls a ""fice"" or a ""foyse"" (from the
Arabic Fas, faswah ?).
 These lines have occurred in Night dcxix, vol. vi. 246; where the pun on Khaliyah is explained. I quote Lane.
 The usual pretext of ""God bizness,"" as the Comoro men call it. For the title of the Ka'abah see my Pilgrimage vol. iii. 149.
 This was in order to travel as a respectable man, he could also send the girl as a spy into the different Harims to learn news of the lady who had eloped.
 A polite form of alluding to their cursing him.
 i.e. on account of the King taking offence at his unceremonious departure.
 i.e. It will be the worse for him.
 I would here remind the reader that ""'Arabiyyun"" pl. 'Urb is a man of pure Arab race, whether of the Ahl al-Madar (=people of mortar, i.e. citizens) or Ahl al-Wabar (=tents of goat or camel's hair); whereas ""A'rábiyyun"" pl. A'ráb is one who dwells in the Desert whether Arab or not. Hence the verse:—
""They name us Al-A'ráb but Al-'Urb is our name.""
 I would remind the reader that the Dinár is the golden denarius (or solidus) of Eastern Rome while the Dirham is the silver denarius, whence denier, danaro, dínheiro, etc., etc. The oldest diners date from A.H. 91-92 (=714-15) and we find the following description of one struck in A.H. 96 by Al-Walid the VI. Ommiade:—
Obverse:
Area. ""There is no iláh but Allah: He is one: He hath no
partner.""
Circle. ""Mohammed is the Messenger of Allah who hath sent
him with the true Guidance and Religion that he
manifest it above all other Creeds.""
Reverse:
Area. ""Allah is one: Allah is Eternal: He begetteth not,
nor is He begot.""
Circle. ""Bismillah: This Dinar was struck anno 96.""
See ""'Ilâm-en-Nas"" (warnings for Folk) a pleasant little volume by Mr. Godfrey Clarke (London, King and Co., 1873), mostly consisting of the minor tales from The Nights especially this group between Nights ccxlvii. and cdlxi.; but rendered valuable by the annotations of my old friend, the late Frederick Ayrton.
 The reader will note the persistency with which the duty of universal benevolence is preached.
 Arab. from Pers. ""Shah-bander"": see vol. iv. 29.
 i.e. of thy coming, a popular compliment.
 This is the doctrine of the universal East; and it is true concerning wives and widows, not girls when innocent or rather ignorant. According to Western ideas Kamar al-Zaman was a young scoundrel of the darkest dye whose only excuses were his age, his inexperience and his passions.
 Arab. ""Dayyús"" prop. = a man who pimps for his own wife and in this sense constantly occurring in conversation.
 This is taking the law into one's own hands with a witness, yet amongst races who preserve the Pundonor in full and pristine force, e.g. the Afghans and the Persian Iliyat, the killing so far from being considered murder or even justifiable homicide would be highly commended by public opinion.
 Arab. ""Nákisátu'aklin wa dín"": the words are attributed to the Prophet whom we find saying, ""Verily in your wives and children ye have an enemy, wherefore beware of them"" (Koran lxiv. 14): compare 1 Cor. vii. 28, 32. But Maître Jehan de Meung went farther,
""Toutes êtez, serez ou fûses
De faict ou de volonté, putes.""
 Arab. ""Habíbí wa tabíbí,"" the common jingle.
 Iblis and his connection with Diabolos has been noticed in vol. i. 13. The word is foreign as well as a P.N. and therefore is imperfectly declined, although some authorities deduce it from ""ablasa""=he despaired (of Allah's mercy). Others call him Al-Háris (the Lion) hence Eve's first-born was named in his honour Abd al-Harts. His angelic name was Azázíl before he sinned by refusing to prostrate himself to Adam, as Allah had commanded the heavenly host for a trial of faith, not to worship the first man, but to make him a Keblah or direction of prayer addressed to the Almighty. Hence he was ejected from Heaven and became the arch enemy of mankind (Koran xviii. 48). He was an angel but related to the Jinn: Al-Bayzáwi, however (on Koran ii. 82), opines that angelic by nature he became a Jinn by act. Ibn Abbas held that he belonged to an order of angels who are called Jinn and begot issue as do the nasnás, the Ghúl and the Kutrub which, however are male and female, like the pre-Adamite manwoman of Genesis, the ""bi-une"" of our modern days. For this subject see Terminal Essay.
 As usual in the East and in the West the husband was the last to hear of his wife's ill conduct. But even Othello did not kill Emilia.
 i.e. Star of the Morning: the first word occurs in Bar
Cokba Barchocheba=Son of the Star, i.e., which was to come out of
Jacob (Numbers xxiv. 17). The root, which does not occur in Heb.,
is Kaukab to thine. This Rabbi Akilah was also called Bar Cozla=
Son of the Lie.
 Here some excision has been judged advisable as the names of the bridegrooms and the brides recur with damnable iteration.
 See the note by Lane's Shaykh at the beginning of the tale. The contrast between the vicious wife of servile origin and the virtuous wife of noble birth is fondly dwelt upon but not exaggerated.
 i.e. those of his water skins for the journey, which as usual required patching and supplying with fresh handles after long lying dry.
 A popular saying also applied to men. It is usually accompanied with showing the open hand and a reference to the size of the fingers. I find this story most interesting from an anthropological point of view; suggesting how differently various races regard the subject of adultery. In Northern Europe the burden is thrown most unjustly upon the man, the woman who tempts him being a secondary consideration; and in England he is absurdly termed ""a seducer."" In former times he was ""paraded"" or ""called out,"" now he is called up for damages, a truly ignoble and shopkeeper-like mode of treating a high offence against private property and public morality. In Anglo-America, where English feeling is exaggerated, the lover is revolver'd and the woman is left unpunished. On the other hand, amongst Eastern and especially Moslem peoples, the woman is cut down and scant reckoning is taken from the man. This more sensible procedure has struck firm root amongst the nations of Southern Europe where the husband kills the lover only when he still loves his wife and lover like is furious at her affection being alienated.
Practically throughout the civilised world there are only two ways of treating women, Moslems keep them close, defend them from all kinds of temptations and if they go wrong kill them. Christians place them upon a pedestal, the observed of all observers, expose them to every danger and if they fall, accuse and abuse them instead of themselves. And England is so grandly logical that her law, under certain circumstances, holds that Mrs. A. has committed adultery with Mr. B. but Mr. B. has not committed adultery with Mrs. A. Can any absurdity be more absurd? Only ""summum jus, summa injuria."" See my Terminal Essay. I shall have more to say upon this curious subject, the treatment of women who can be thoroughly guarded only by two things, firstly their hearts and secondly by the ""Spanish Padlock.""Embed",en,"{'resemblance', 'pure', 'santons', 'splendid', 'faring', 'careseas', 'folk', 'tazid', 'plur', 'celebrated', 'comparatively', 'ghúl', 'burn', 'foeminas', 'hearkening', 'fortunate',

I summoned you, please come to me
Don't bury thoughts that you really want
I fill you up, drink from my cup
Within me lies what you really want

Come, lay me down

'Cause you know this sound

In the middle of the night

Just call my name
I'm yours to tame
In the middle of the night

You gon' get yours, oh no, ooh

Feel powerful, but it's me again

Maybe it's the way you say my name
Maybe it's the way you play your game
But it's so good, I've never known anybody like you
But it's so good, I've never dreamed of nobody like you

And I've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime
And I'm pretty sure that you are that love of mine

'Cause I'm in a field of dandelions
Wishin' on every one that you'd be mine, mine
And I see forever in your eyes
I feel okay when I see you smile, smile

Wishin' on dandelions all of the time
Prayin' to God that one day you'll be mine
Wishin' on dandelions all of the time, all of the time

Somebody said they saw you
The person you were kissing wasn't me
And I would never ask you
I just kept it to myself

I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you creepin', please don't let it show
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know

I think about it when I hold you
When lookin' in your eyes, I can't believe
And I don't need to know the truth
Baby, keep it to yourself

I don't wanna know

Goin' out tonight, changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Everything she never had, she's showing off
Driving too fast, moon is breaking through her hair
She's heading for something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

(Ooh) We're only getting older, baby
(Ooh) And I've been thinking about it lately
(Ooh) Does it ever drive you crazy
(Ah-ah-ah) Just how fast the night changes?
(Ooh) Everything that you've ever dreamed of
(Ooh) Disappearing when you wake up
(Ooh) But there's nothing to be afraid of
(Ah-ah-ah) Even when the night changes
(Ooh) It will never change me and you

Chasing her tonight, doubts are running 'round her head
He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beating loud and she doesn't want it to stop
Moving too fast, moon is lightin' up her skin
She's falling, doesn't even know it yet

Every time, I've been thinking of our life
Every time, what you give is some of mine
All the time
Yeah, yeah

Bagh ko tu shaakh mat dikha
Chotay mujhay aankh mat dikha
Tu roshni mat daal meri zaat pe
Tu sooraj ko chiragh mat dikha
Hisaab kar chuka apne amaal ka
Behad gunahgar behad khatakaar
Behas bekar, I’m the king of this shit
Kuch bhi scripted nai hai phir bhi lagay film ye
Kitnay laa-ilm hain wo meri vision se
Wo tou hansa kartay thay mere zikar pe
Big dawg spending two hundred liqour pe
Larkay baatein karein saari that I’m bigger than
Unke azam unke chehro pe dikh rahay
Par inki pohonch na mein boy tera waise bhi
They said they’re married to the game but ye casanova complex
Jahan wo chahtay numbers, it’s not about the legacy
I’m that same kid
Paise joray for recordings like cuz I meant it
Ghar mein studio banaya, I don’t rent it
Going in and out the city and it’s hectic
Anti ab bhi kartay shakk kitnay skeptic
Tere fans ko kya yaad teri setlist?
Rockstar lifestyle and I’m reckless
Twenty minutes in your party and I brexit
Dekh mentality
I was 13 with a headphone hand held mic aur betahasha audacity
Now they keep asking me, ""mein kaisa karu feel?""
Chotay I’m good
Abhi idher hain tou idher ke hum baap loug
And when I’m gone tou kahaniya sunayein ge tumhein jo wo chalay thay mere saath loug
Tujhay yaaro mein kya bhai milay?
Bhai milay jinke dilo mein safai milay?
Na he milein tujhay saanp tere raastay mein
Tujhay jab bhi milay bhai bas dua he milay
Lougo se hota nai ab album ka wait aur
But as an artist meri apni mental state aur

Can't keep you close
I don't know where's—
What in the world do you—?
You follow me somewhere on the sea
honestly
Every time, I've been thinking of our life
Every time, what you give is some of mine
all the time
Yeah, yeah

You didn't see the branches in the garden
I don't want to see anything
Tu roshni mat daal meri zaat pe
You don't see the sun's lamp
Make account of your deeds
Behad guilty behad khatakaar
Behaas bekar, I'm the king of this shit
Kuch bhi script nai hai phir bhi lagay film ye
How much knowledge is there in my vision?
Wo tou hansa kartay thay mere zikar pe
Big dawg spending two hundred liquor on
Larkay baatein karein saari that I'm bigger than
Unke azam unke chehro pe dikh rahay
Par inki pohonch na mein boy tera wise bhi
They said they're married to the game but ye casanova complex
Jahan wo chahtay numbers, it's not about the legacy
I'm that same kid
Paise joray for recordings like cuz I meant it
Ghar mein studio banaya, I don't rent it
Going in and out of the city and it's hectic
Anti ab bhi kartay shakk kitnay skeptik
Tere fans ko kya yaad teri setlist?
Rockstar lifestyle and I'm reckless
Twenty minutes in your party and I brexit
Dekh mentality
I was 13 with a headphone hand held mic and betahasha audacity
Now they keep asking me, ""How do I feel?""
Chotay I'm good
Abhi idher hain tou idher ke hum baap loug
And when I'm gone tou kahaniya sunayein ge tumhein jo wo chalay thay mere saath loug

'Cause there's magic in my bones (In my bones)
I-I-I got this feeling in my soul
Go ahead and throw your stones
'Cause there's magic in my bones

'Cause there's magic in my bones

Look in the mirror of my mind
Turnin' the pages of my life
Walkin' the path so many paced a million times
Drown out the voices in the air
Leavin' the ones that never cared
Pickin' the pieces up and buildin' to the sky

Gimme, gimme, gimme some time to think
I'm in the bathroom, looking at me
Face in the mirror is all I need (Ooh-ooh)
Wait until the reaper takes my life
Never gonna get me out alive
I will live a thousand million lives (Ooh-ooh)

Where I'm losing all control
'Cause there's magic in my bones
I-I-I got this feeling in my soul
Go ahead and throw your stones
'Cause there's magic in my bones

Playin' with a stick of dynamitе
There was nevеr gray in black and white
There was never wrong 'til there was right (Ooh-ooh)
Feelin' like a boulder hurtlin'
Seein' all the vultures circlin'
Burnin' in the flames, I'm workin' in
Turnin' in a bed, that's darkenin'

Yeah, the past was honestly the best
But my best is what comes next
I'm not playin', nah for sure
그날을 향해 숨이 벅차게
You and I, best moment is yet to come
Moment is yet to come, yeah

다들 언제부턴가
말하네 우릴 최고라고
온통 알 수 없는 names
이젠 무겁기만 해
노래가 좋았다고
그저 달릴 뿐이라고

언젠가부터 붙은 불편한 수식어
최고란 말은 아직까지 낯간지러워
난 난 말야 걍 음악이 좋은 걸
여전히 그때와 다른 게 별로 없는걸
아마 다른 게 별로 없다면
You'll say it's all a lie, yeah
난 변화는 많았지만
변함은 없었다 해, a new chapter
매 순간이 새로운 최선
지금 난 마치 열세 살

그 이유를 물어본다면
내 심장이 말하잖아
We ain't about it
이 세상의 기대
We ain't about it
최고란 기준의 step
We ain't about it
왕관과 꽃, 수많은 트로피
We ain't about it

Running out of breath toward that day

Everyone sometime

I am, I just like music
Still not much different from back then
maybe if nothing else
You'll say it's all a lie, yeah
I've had a lot of changes
There was no change, a new chapter
Every moment is new best
Now I'm like thirteen
Spit like me back then, huh

I still have a lot to learn
I have a lot to fill in my life
If you ask why
my heart says
We ain't about it
expectations of this world
We ain't about it
Steps based on the highest standards
We ain't about it
Crowns and flowers, lots of trophies
We ain't about it
Dream and hope, and goin' forward
We so about it
Going around a long circle, eventually back to the same place, back to one

If you wanna see the future
You should come and see us
We can be a lot of things but we choose to be us
Aaja baithe thori baat kare zindagi ki
Sab ke apne apne matlab par mai matlabi nahi
Ek hi baar jeena hai toh, why not meri jaan?
Koshish karne walo pe ho khuda boht meherbaan
Kalamtor kalakaar mere boht qadardaan
Jab bhi soche toh soche out of the box meri jaan
Ye real talk hai brother ke hustle ruk jaati agar
Toh us manzil pe kaise pohonch te ke jaana hai jidher
Aane waale kal ki khabar hai na guzre kal ki fikar
Game daal di hai heavy baby tu vibe' toh pakar
And just move, to groove of this life
Kabhi high kabhi low that's the rule of this life
Love hi love hai meri jaan, i'm all about the good vibes
Hard time aarzi it's gonna be a good life
Umeed pe hai poori duniya kayam
Aur ab karte karte grind kyun na badal de hum time
Mind over matter so i hope you don't mind
Seedhi baat jaani na hi jaate daaye na hi baaye

Why not, aaja soche daayre se bahar
Why not, sawaal nahi jawaab meri jaan
Why not, har mushkil honi paar mere yaar
Ye woh mindset that's gonna take you far, meri jaan, why not?
Why not? Why not?
Why not? Why not? Why not?
Why not meri jaan, why not?

Sawaal wo hi hai bas karne ke andaaz alag
Masle se bari soch hoti meri baat samajh
Andhere bhi ujaagar ho jaate hai chahe jab
Manzil beshak durr jitni mur ke peeche bhaage kab?
Life in the fast lane, safar aaj bhi jaari hai
Khwabo se bare faisle, sar pe zimmedari hai
Mehnat jaati raiga na, uska phal hai
Hum hi aaj hai, hum hi kal hai
Roz karu grow jaise roz naya show
Naya din nayi khoj, mera ilam mera dost
Kabhi khud ko de dosh, kabhi khush mai khamosh
Kabhi is qalam se badal du apno ki soch
Ye sikhe huye zindagi se
Kal kahi the ab kahi hai
Waqt toh badle har ghari pe
Kamtari ab bartari hai
Beghari se behtri
Barabari mai bebasi
Ye khud se kaise bedili hai?
Misaal choro mai bas ek khayaal hun
Hote sawaal, kaise itna bakamaal hun?
Soche bahaal hone de mai wo majaal hun
Logo ki umeed hun, mai kaise sab kuch haar dun?

कल रास्ते में गम मिलगया था
लगके गले में रो दिया
जो सिर्फ मेरा, था सिर्फ मेरा
मैंने उसे क्यू खो दिया?
हां वो आंखे जिन्हे में  चूमता था बेवजह
प्यार मेरे लिए क्यों उनमें बाकी ना रहा

हमनवा मेरे, तू है तो मेरी सांसें चले
बतादे कैसे मैं जियूंगा तेरे बिना
हो, हमनवा मेरे, तू है तो मेरी सांसें चले
बतादे कैसे मैं जियूंगा तेरे बिना

हर वक्त दिलको जो सताए
ऐसी कमी है तू
मैं भी ना जानू ये की इतना
क्यों लाजमी है तू
नींदें जाके ना लौटी कितनी रातें ढल गई
इतने तारे गिने की उंगलियां भी जल गई

हमनवा मेरे, तू है तो मेरी सांसें चले
बतादे कैसे मैं जियूंगा तेरे बिना

Breakaan maar maar tire di main cheek kad da
All the loki takde we ki hogeya, we aaj mera dil
Ruk gya, unu main puchda

Yeah
I know sometimes
Things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey
What Daddy always tell you?
Straighten up, little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you cryin' about?
You got me

Hailie, I know you miss your Mom, and I know you miss your Dad
When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there, Daddy's wit' you in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears, Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Lainie, Uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
We're all we got in this world when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, Mama's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just somethin' we have no control over, and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream

Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright

Heh, it's funny
I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night crying
'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your Mom was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your Mama's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot
So Mama moved back on to Chalmers in the flat, one-bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre, and flew you and Mama out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Mama had to leave me
Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV
And Mama didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Mama developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house just reminiscin'
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Shh! Mama's only gone for the moment
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright

And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad! (Haha)403Embed","257 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçePortuguêsItalianoDeutschFrançaisالعربيةMockingbird Lyrics
Yeah
I know sometimes
Things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey
What Daddy always tell you?
Straighten up, little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you cryin' about?
You got me

Hailie, I know you miss your Mom, and I know you miss your Dad
When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there, Daddy's wit' you in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears, Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Lainie, Uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
We're all we got in this world when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, Mama's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'

Dekho inn dou pal ke raahi hain panchi hum
Kitnay saalon se bhaagay hain ghum se hum
Aagay toofan hai baadal barsein gay ab
Laayein gay nayi khushiyan wo apnay sang
Hai ye raat andheri neendh na aaye
Dhun ye sar main ghoomay bus
Sur ye dil ko kyun machlaye
Dil se boloon, ""easy bruh""
Yaad teri mujh ko sataye
Love in the time of Corona bro
Kyun tu mujh se door hojaye?

No sé si lo que hago es lo correcto... Ya casi actúo
Sólo por convicción basado en mis razonamientos
¡hay cosas que no quiero ni pensar!, ya estoy harto
De que en mi televisor pase casi siempre el mismo programa
Y su contexto
Y es que antes de decirme ""sólo cambia de canal""
¡sólo tengo uno! así que no puedo hacerlo...
Aunque hay días que digo que por azar corro con suerte
Y el programa cambia y de eso no me quejo pero...
Pero еs que sé que casi diario está еl programa ese de mierda
Que no quiero ni probar suerte encendiendo la pantalla otra vez
Ya que si lo hago jugaré con mi ánimo
Y puede que el canal me haga volver a caer
Algunos dicen que el problema recae sobre mi pantalla
Y su solución es que la cambie por otra y ya queda
Pero no saben que esa pantalla me ayudó a ver lo ciega
Que es la gente y que no estarán siempre de acuerdo con lo que piensas...
Y si tu solución es que contrate cable pues
No servirá, quiero algo real, no sólo evadirme
No quiero una felicidad artificial porque
Me divertirá ¡y luego volveré a aburrirme!
You might also likeEn serio pido una disculpa pero no puedo estar Happy
Siempre... Ni que mi nombre fuese Pharrell Williams
Tengo mis altibajos pero obvio que en mis altos
Y con quien se lo merece voy a dar una sonrisa, ¡así de fácil!

I don't know if what I do is the right thing... I almost acted
Only by conviction based on my reasoning
There are things I don't even want to think about! I'm fed up
The fact that the same program almost always goes on on my television
and its context
And it is that before telling me ""just change the channel""
I only have one! so i can't do it...
Although there are days when I say that by chance I am lucky
And the program changes and I'm not complaining about that but...
But I know that this shitty program is there almost every day
I don't even want to try my luck turning on the screen again
Because if I do, I'll play with my mood
And maybe the channel will make me fall again
Some say that the problem lies with my screen
And your solution is to change it for another and that's it
But they don't know that screen helped me see how blind
What are people and who will not always agree with what you think...
And if your solution is to hire cable, then
Won't do, I want something real, not just get away
I don't want artificial happiness because
I'll have fun and then I'll be bored again!
You might also likeI seriously apologize but I can't be Happy
Always... Even if my name was Pharrell Williams
I have my ups and downs but obviously in my ups
And with whoever deserves it I'll give a smile, it's that easy!

I wanna take you somewhere so you know I care
But it's so cold and I don't know where
I brought you daffodils in a pretty string
But they won't flower like they did last spring
And I wanna kiss you, make you feel alright
I'm just so tired to share my nights
I wanna cry and I wanna love
But all my tears have been used up

On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up

On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
Up

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

And if somebody hurts you, I wanna fight
But my hand's been broken one too many times
So I'll use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude
Words, they always win, but I know I'll lose
And I'd sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna learn to love

Tu aya nahi kyun?

Aahat pe teri mein neend se bhi uth paru
Sab kuch bhula kar mein yaadein samaita karu
Phir tere sirhanay mein baarish mein bheega karu

Mil k bhi tu na mera
Hai na yakeen ab tera
Yaadon mein khoya hai dil ye roya hai tujh ko dhoonda tha bewaja
Janay ye aalam hai kesa
Aaye ga kesay sawera
Tanhai aisi hai mujh se kehti ye tujh ko phir se loon bula
Tu na janay tere bin mein
Kesay pal hain ye guzaaray
I mean I’m sorry for the heartbreak
You know we never should’ve parted

Walk the stage charo taraf naam goonj raha ho

Afsos ke afsanay mein gumaan dhoond raha hu
Yaar kiya tha dafan yahin kahin abhi
Tooti takhtiyo pe uska naam dhoond raha hu
Kya rakhu bhalla waqt ke tarazu mein

Mein dunya se katt jaanay walo mein
Naraaz ho ke bhi hum thay mananay walo mein
Hum kyun takkay wo raahein anay walo ki
Hum takk rahay hain qaaflay ab jaanay walo ke
Munazray khatam na ho humaray ab
Tu theek tou mein theek kaun kis se haaray ab
Sudhar nai sakta mein bas galtiya sudharein ab
Wo chaand tha mera hum uske hain sitaaray ab
Choror hum jaa rahay ab kya rahay tumharay hum
Glass half full, ab bhi tujhay dil ka pura haal nai sun rahay hum

Thats how i want it

Zamana jalay, likhu jab bhi ganay mai
Han mana baray tere bhi deewanay hain
Hum gulshan mai kharay unhe gulistan tou anay de
Shayad phir ek aur mulaqaaat issi bahane se
Shayarana, ye baaten meri shayarana
Fayda nai, mai dekhu apna fayda na
Mehnat jati raigan na baby par ma Tyga na
Bygones tou bygones aaj torunga koi qaida na
I like the way she moves, makes my mind boggle
Tu hi jese groove, tujhe dia saara time pagal
Melodies hum bhool jatay karna tum rewind zara
Baby mujhe line derahi, mai hi kehraha mind na kar
Aur jaam TūTeñge is sharāb-ḳhāne meñ
Mausamoñ ke aane meñ mausamoñ ke jaane meñ
Har dhaḌaktе patthar ko log dil samajhte haiñ
Umreñ biit jaatī haiñ dil ko dil banāne mеñ

Socha likhunga aaj aur nahi
Mai tere pass jab koi aur nahi
We can do it all night
Scars on my neck & I don’t mind
I don’t mind, I don’t mind
It’s all about the patience girl I’m cruisin in my own lane

Drunk off your love jaisay liquor pe behaal
Ghaur o fikr ney kar dia nazam-nigar
Tere zikar mein ghoomti hai kalam kamaal, eh
Shehr e dil mein lagay hein tere billboard
Galliyon mein chalti hai teri wali lingo
I got 99 problems

Ghum be hisaab the
Alag he wafa ke zaabte
Alag he hain agar manzilein to kyun na alag he rakhein hum raastay
Kyun na aaj se
Mita dein ye kismat hum haath se
Aur zehen azaad ho yaad se
Ham mit jayen jaa milein khaak se
Tere sheher bhi aye par safar se khatam na huay ye faaslay
Zakham bharen na baray be-reham se pesh aye hain haadsay
Baat se baat nikali ke tere dil pe lag jaye meri baat koi
Tu toot'tay taaro pe mange mujhе tujhe mayasar ho еsi raat koi
I've been working a lot
Likhna nahi chhorta likhna he tod hai
Biktе hain ye gaanе lakho main
Kya ye sab paise ka shor hai?
Kal sath na honge par yaad to hogi or bolo na zindagi kya hai
Yaadon ki maala ha yaadon ke ilawa kabhi kuch baaki raha hai
Kisi ne kya khoob kaha ha tere darmiyan bas tu he khada hai
Jhukao zaroori hai
Usse zaahir hota hai ke tu he bada hai
Jisse gaye hue khudse zamana hua woh tum main bhatakta hai
Mein khud nahi hun ye koi or hai mujhme jo tumko tarasta hai
Wujood ek tamasha tha hum jo dekhte the woh bhi ek tamasha hai
Hai mere dil ki guzarish ke mujhe mat choro ye jaan ka takaza hai
Ham zindagi dhoondte dhoondte maut ke muh main he jaatay rahay
Par hum thehray kalakaar
Khoj main bhi gun'gunatay rahay

We could go all night
We could go all night
Aisi adaa dekhi
Pehli dafaa dekhi
Aisi jafaa bhi humne dekhi na
Aisi adaa dekhi
Pehli dafaa dekhi
Aisi jafaa bhi humne dekhi na
Yes let me see you move in slo-mo
Aagay jitnay bhi hain raaz sab khol dou
Like baby we should talk for a minute
Give a sign, laavan manzilaan kareeb haigi jo jo
And I don’t really mind ridin’ solo
But when you pick a side that’s a low blow
Baby tell me how you feel and then I could make it real
I could make a plan and act like I don’t know, I don’t know
Baby push it to the left
Now push it to the right
Got me on hold, we ain’t got all night
Light a fire in my heart, you can have my life
Swear no lies, everything’s on sight
Said I would never leave, then again I might
Chal mere naal, you can have my life
Teri vakhri hai chaal and i don’t know why, swear no lies
Don’t waste my time
Give it up, give it up
Light a fire now
Give it up, give it up
Get me higher now
Everything’s on sight
I could lose my mind
I could lose my mind, like baby
Give it up, give it up
Light a fire now
Give it up, give it up
Get me higher now
Everything’s on sight
We could go all night
We could go all night

144,144,144,Abdullah Siddiqui,GO,"3 ContributorsHeroes LyricsMy heroes never wore tights or appeared on cartoon channels
They had long beards and kept clothes above the ankles
No combing the streets, like beasts at night looking for thieves
My heroes fought their egos, and narrated ahadith
And some of my heroes were once bad guys too
Baby killers and highway robbers, if you only knew what they knew
Cause you gotta know a lie in order to recognize the truth
And what the point of knowing truth if you can't back it up with proof
So to prove my heroes were united by a single point of view
Why else would they choose to go against what their fathers used to do?
Unless they knew, that paradise was worth being abused
The best of views, if only you could walk a mile in their shoes,
Oh what I wouldn't do to kick it with Abduallah Ibn Musuud,
Listen to him recite the Quran, sad to go into ruku
Yeah that would be cool, but me and Hamza, we would kick it old school
Joke about the Jahilliya, silly things they used to do
If I could pick my own crew, Salman Al-Farsi would have to be in it,
An honest seeker of truth, may Allah bless his spirit,
Have Tea with Julilibib, Coffee with Anas Ibn Malik
Anything to pick their brains and gain a better understanding
Could you imagine taking a class with Abdallah Ibn Abbas
A scholar by the age of 10, just a boy amongst the men
And if I had one friend, it would be Abu Bakr as Siddiq,
Someone to hold you down and to really represent,
When Sumayya held her chin to her killers, did she think?
We would name our little girls after her to teach them strength
And who cares about these rappers, we got Hassan ibn Thabit,
Dude was sick with the flow, can't believe you didn't know,
That Zaid was a slave who became one of praise
Lived the American dream, when America was Cree
Umar Bin Khattab was a G, held it down for this deen
A real superman, made the devils cross the street
And if I ever had beef, I would call up Khalid bin Walid
He was a ride or die homie, amongst the Salaf as Saliheen,
And if I just closed my eyes, man, I could almost see
Bilal amongst the cold morning breeze, Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar
Cause surely salah is much better than sleep
Like Abu Sufyan after he embraced the deen
On this earth, Talha was a walking shaheed
And Jafar gave his life for this Ummah's victory
May Allah be pleased and grant them all the highest levels of heaven
Like Uthman ibn Affan, who even the angles were shy in front of
Aisha was a genius, every word was like a thesis
Mother to all believers, pure like that of Isa's
Khadija held the fetus of Fatima, who was the teacher
Of Hasan and Husayn, sons of Ali who were slain
Man you gotta know these names, cause these people paved the way
It's a shame, we know more about them monkeys on BET
This is our history, all the sacrifices that they made for me
Gave to me a legacy that I could be proud to keep
Said: Be! It was decreed, at Badr we were only 300 deep
But with the angels on our side, who could even compete?
Although he was a man of peace who preached speech before the sword
He raged a war against error, the worship of fake Lords
Came to restore the deen that Ibrahim laid before
Extreme in his need to feed the miskin and the poor
Yeah, he was hardcore with his face to the floor
Of praying so long that his feet became sore
Uhhhh, cuz he got down like that
And told all the rich they should pay the zakat
And make the salah, and spread the salaam
And declare Ashhadu alla ilaha illallah
Muhammed arrasul Allah, Salla Allahu alayhi wasallam,
Was the difference between Jannah and Jahennim,
Like the mailman just delivering a message
Who else do you know with a swagger that's blessed?
The best and perfected, corrected the method
Madina state of mind, coming from the hood of Mecca
Champion companions, homeboys were go-getters
Did it bigger and better, had followers before twitter
The leader of leaders, amir to believers
Enjoined all the good and forbade all the evil
My hero taught people that we were all equal
The best of examples outlined what is legal
Forever I'm grateful for all that he came for
May blessings and peace always reach to my mentor
My teacher, my brother, my hero, my prophet
Muhammed, Sallau alahe wsalaam
And that's how it goes, so tell everyone you know
That this party don't stop till the son of Mary come home
I am pleased with my Lord and Islam as my deen,
May we die on these words, Allahuma, ameen1Embed","3 ContributorsHeroes LyricsMy heroes never wore tights or appeared on cartoon channels

Maine jab dekha tha tujhko
Raat bhi wo yaad hai mujhko
Taare ginte-ginte so gaya
Dil mera dhadka tha kass ke
Kuch kaha tha tune hans ke
Main usi pal tera ho gaya

Aasmano pe jo khuda hai, usse meri yahi dua hai
Chaand yeh har roz main dekhun tere sath mein

Aankh uthi mohabbat ne angdayi li
Dil ka sauda hua chandni raat mein
O, teri nazron ne kuch aisa jaadu kiya
Loot gaye hum to pehli mulakaat mein
O, Aankh uthi


Paanv rakhna na zameen par, jaan ruk ja tu ghadi bhar
Thode taare to bichha doon, main tere vaaste
Aazma le mujhko yaara, tu zara sa kar ishara
Dil jala ke jagmaga doon, main tere vaaste

Sleazin' and teasin', I'm sittin' on him
All of my diamonds are drippin' on him
I met him at the bar, it was twelve or something
I ordered two more wines 'cause tonight, I want him

A little context if you care to listen
I find myself in a shit position
The man that I love sat me down last night
And he told me that it's over, dumb decision
And I don't wanna feel how my heart is rippin'
In fact, I don't wanna feel, so I stick to sippin'
And I'm out on the town with a simple mission
In my little black dress and this shit is sittin'

Just a heart broke bitch, high heels six inch
In the back of the nightclub, sippin' champagne
I don't trust any of these bitches I'm with
In the back of the taxi sniffin' cocaine
Drunk calls, drunk texts, drunk tears, drunk sex

I got a new man on me, it's about to get sweaty
Last night really was the cherry on the cake
Been some dark days lately and I'm findin' it cripplin'
Excuse my state, I'm as high as your hopes
That you'll make it to my bed, get me hot and sizzlin'
If I take a step back to see the glass half-full
At least it's the Prada two-piece that I'm trippin' in
And I'm already actin' like a dick, know what I mean?
So you might as well stick it in

12 o'clock on the dock
Whеn the cops came down to the block
And they knocked at the spot
They came through trying to take
What i got there
They on the news claiming someone I'm not but
Talking crazy on the net you get shot cause
Coming where i'm from around here it gets hot
Make sure that you keep the lights on
Make sure that you keep the doors locked up
So my girl don't cry while i'm gone
Don't ask where i'm gone and
Don't ask for how long
Far away from home
On the phone with my mom
Light my spliff tryna right my wrongs
Fuck this shit dawg look what we done
PTSD when i look at these guns
Need a whole cake
I aint leaving no crumbs
That's how i'm raised
Coming now where i'm from
Late night nightmares i'm dreaming screaming
Steady trying to talk my demons
I'm just praying that god plays defense
Devil on my shoulder i hear that bitch breathing

I stepped back from the game to keep you out of harm's way
Risk it all for the game but it take more than one person
Two people one 'til I feel the same when you hurtin'
I was still in middle school when Givens fled the whip
Bodies were droppin' before we ever knew 'bout the truck
We gonna be family no matter what way this go, brother
From the ugly corner where everybody betray each other
I let you hang in the jets, I let you bang with my set
Put you before my own flesh like why’d I ever do that?
Me and the streets got soul ties
The devil on my shoulder he whisper but I told him

Angel, don't fly so close to me

Family all that you got at the end
Hope you get the message
I ain't tryin' to make it without you
But if I got to then I got you
This ain't about me, it's about the whole cake
We can take a slice on a different day
Just keep your plate
God, family, hustle, goals
Heart, mind, body, soul
Watching out for street signs on a narrow road
Heaven at the end, prayin' for the lost souls with my angels

Don't you know, don't you know, don't you know, don't you know?
I will never let you down
No, I'll never be perfect
Never want to see you hurtin'
You should go, you should go
Get away fast a hundred on the dash tonight

Chehre badalte jaayenge
Chalti jaayegi, chalti jaayegi
Ye dunya
Rukti hai kahaan, kisi ke bhi liye?

Chehre badalte rahe
Zindagi waise hi chalti rahi
Dunya badalti hai fitratan
Iss mein humari koi galti nahi
Palti rahi dil me udaasi
Andheron se leke roshni tak
Khaamiyon se khamoshiyon tak
Hosh se leke mad-hoshiyon tak
Afsos nahi ke afsaane likhe
Woh afsaane mabni afsuradagi par
Khuda tu deta hai be-hisaab
Mere dard me thodi toh kami kar
Khile na kyoon yahaan ab woh gulaab
Kyun rahi bahaar ki kami bas
Qismat humaare hi haath me
Us pe ikhtiyaar ki hai kami bas
Woh log bhi guzar gaye, woh ghar bhi jal chuke
Wahaan ab kuch nahi
Wahaan se ab gard uthe
Zakham toh bharenge dost, waqt ki marham mein shifa hai
Par waqt be-rahm hai dost
Wo kab kisi ke liye ruka hai
Jhuke na sar, phelain na haath humaare
Ab bas yahi du'a hai
Kabhi-kabhi aaye soch, jo hua wo theek hi hua hai
Sabar se sabaq jo mile hain
Sabar se ab meri sulah hai
Ke koi nahi agar tera, toh meri jaan khuda hai

Shalimar garden me saade paanch baje
Mera shoot ke liye hair & make-up
Jaldi mere shades laa
Lekin pehle check the parameter
Gaano ke badhte decibels
Cheque pe badhte decimel
It's incredible!
Mein Ismat Chughtai
Kaise qismat khul aayi
I think about this at night
Jeewen baarishaan de weather da Marshall Mathers
Mera instinct animalistic
Mad magician ya mathematician
I never take second position
I'm getting ballistic, cataclysmic
Bilkul asli, likhoon meticulously
Lafaz mere medicinal se
Love kiya maine qalam se
Sach bola maine kasam se
Rang dekho kaise badalte dikhte hai sab ke
Karte qabze, baatein pakki, waade kacche
I've had enough of it, but I keep going
Got no option, but to keep flowing
Keep the toxic outta' my zone
Rakhein tashreef apni off of my throne
But before I got to go, let me tell you this
One thing i need you to know
If you ever need a friend, you can call my phone

Aur hum akele hi jalte rahe

Chalo roshni ki simt chalein
Apni zaat pe yaqeen mera

I took my drugs and took my lovin' when I left out the spot
I left the party with a Barbie, marking X on the dot
She calls my phone up, but I told her, ""I'm a loner"" (Uh)
But she likes my watch and my droptop and my persona (Uh)
We hit the highway, one-five-five with my whole foot on the dash
She's in my ear, she's got no fear, she could care less if we crash

But on my radar, I've got some nerve to play hard
I waited for my chance, but playboys, we don't dance, dance, dance

I lost my heart (Uh)
Speedin' car, goin' ninety in the rain
Shе took my heart, filled it with nothin' but pain
This beat in my dancе is not for romance
I wanna stay, but playboys, we don't dance, dance, dance (I)

So I won't dance again (I), oh, baby
No, I won't dance again (That's why), oh, yeah (Uh)
No, I won't dance again (I)
No, I won't dance again
Pretty baby, ooh

Uh
Face in the daylight, wastin' time on the stars in the sky
She's got my pager, blankets of love fall on my eyes
Then I'm reminded, love don't come 'til you find it
I just hope that it's workin', I'm yearnin', I'm searchin', uh
The afterparty was on Wilson and 73rd
You got the notion that somebody else was with me first

But on my radar, you had some nerve to play hard
You took away my chance, but playboys, we don't dance, dance, dance

I lost my heart (Uh)
Speedin' car goin' ninety in the rain
She took my heart, filled it with nothin' but pain
This beat in my dance is not for romance
I wanna stay, but playboys, we don't dance, dance, dance (I)

So I won't dance again (I), oh, baby

Jurr na paaye baad tere
Tukre dil ke rakhun kya
Yaad teri koi baat nahi
Lafzon me main likhun kya?
Chaaon thi tere saath ki
Be reham, dhoop me
Deewanawar phirun
Kho ke apna saebaan

Tu mehram na raha mera
Tu mehram na raha

Chup ne aisi baat kahi
Khamoshi me sun baithe
Janmon jo na beet sake
Hum wo andhere chun baithe
Kitni karun main iltija
Saath ki chaand se
Dil bharke aanhe thak gaya
Phir bhi naa ro paaye hum

Alas, all the nights will be cut but you will not come
Again, see you again, man
The more often I see you, the easier it will be
Let your passion of love go away
Tell me the state of the heart, I am also happy
Let your passion of love go away
You know that they call me crazy for my love
Every second you're erasing all that's hurt
The more often I see you, the easier it will be
Let your passion of love go away
Tell me the state of the heart, I am also happy
Let your passion of love go away
Two moments full of memories of you
Like Marham Dil Par
Sang, Sang who cut a journey
A house found in Banjare
Where did you go to protect us?
Whatever happens to this heart is only yours
Whatever tears are my sister's tears
You have to take care of him
The more often I see you, the easier it will be
Let your passion of love go away
Tell me the state of the heart, I am also happy
Let your passion of love go away
You know that they call me crazy for my love
Every second you're erasing all that's hurt
The more often I see you, the easier it will be
Let your passion of love go away
Tell me the state of the heart, I am also happy

Tu yeh jaane tere aage mazboor hain
Kis baat ka guroor
Fayda uthayi yeh kaisa yeh suroor hai
Deta saadayen kyun na tujhko sunayi de
Tera deewana poori duniya gawahi de
Main laparwah sarphira par bewafa nahi
Kab tak yeh aashiq aakhir apni safayi de

Tu haan kar kabhi main badlu abhi
Hai meri museebat yeh tera zameer
Chehra asal tu apna dikhayi jaaye
Kyun phir mujhko satayi jaaye

Teri bas yaad, yaad, yaad, yaad
Aaye mujhe baar, baar, baar, baar
Yeh sone na de jeene na de
Aur kisi ka hone na de

Teri bas yaad, yaad, yaad, yaad

Mein bola I'm going home but
Asal mein I'm going crazy
Double black for the pain
Rollie rollie got me faded

Kala mere dil ke kitni qareeb hai
Guzaari hai gurbat mein raatein
Kitaabon mein milni nahi baatein
Aane wale aate honge
Mujhe unki fikar hai jo nahi aate
Tere bin eid nai eid
Chehra nahi qaabil-e-deed
Chehre pe fikar hai wazeh
Tu chehre ko padhna to seekh
Tu mujhko raaste de
Main tujhko badle mein faasle dun
Tu mujhko aasre de
Main dil ki tizori se raaz ek dun
Chahe phir saans na lein
Tere deedar aur maut qubool
Karun qurban tujhpe yeh zindagi
To hogi har saans wasool
Main badlun to banu phir kya
Ke tu mera hoke bhi na
Got everything that I need
Give you anything that you want
Yeah I smoke trees, write songs
Teri soch, all night long
I could right all my wrongs
But you're gone and
Tu haan kar kabhi main badlu abhi
Hai meri museebat yeh tera zameer
Chehra asal tu apna dikhayi jaaye
Kyun phir mujhko satayi jaaye

Teri bas yaad, yaad, yaad, yaad
Aaye mujhe baar, baar, baar, baar
Yeh sone na de jeene na de
Aur kisi ka hone na de
Teri bas yaad, yaad, yaad, yaad

Raat yeh sone ke liye magar hum soye nahi
Karwat badalte rehte sochon mein hum khoye rahe
Yaadon ke baste liye aankhon ko bhigoye nahi
Khud pe yeh fakhar, woh mere jaane pe roye nahi
Yaar deewar bane, rishton mein daraar dale
Guzre kya saal bade, ghum'on ke pahaad bane
Sabki zubaan bane dil yeh mazaar bane
Aa na darbaar mere likh rahe raat ke 4 baje
Lafzon ke taajir, hum hijrat o hijr ke aadi
Barsa den ye baadal, zamane se pucho hum kitne bahadur
Wo aaj bhi samjhein humein paagal
Khud dhundein jawaab, kyun puchun sawaal
Meri kya mazaal? Vehmo gumaan, kya dun main misaal?
Tu hai bemisaaal, har basti ujaagar
Hum shab ke musaafir, safar bhi mutaasir
Mai urdu ka rakim, nazar badi qaatil
Hustle meri wazeh, gawah mera asim
Main duniya se ajiz, likh raha teri khaatir
Raatein yeh dhalti nahi
Waqt ki tarah kyun badalti rahi
Maanegi woh apni ghalti nahi
Main aaj bhi wohi, koyi jaldi nahi

Teri bas yaad, yaad, yaad, yaad
Aaye mujhe baar, baar, baar, baar

What's the teacher
What are you doing?
Data is available, why are you listening to it?
Tera deewana poori duniya gawahi de
Main laparwah sarphira par bewafa nahi
Kab tak yeh aashiq aakhir apni safayi de

Tu haan kar kabhi main badlu abhi
Hai meri museebat yeh tera zameer
You can see your original face

Raat yeh son ke liye magar hum soye nahi
Karwat badalte rehte mein hum khoye rahe
For the sake of the yard, the eyes did not get wet.
Khud pe yeh fakhar, woh mere jaane pe roye nahi
Friend, god bless you
What bad things have passed, the mountains of wandering have been made
Everyone's tongue is gone
Aa na darbaar mere likh rahe raat ke 4 baje
Words are taajir, hum hijrat o hijr ke aadi
It rains every day, how brave we have been in the past
Wo aaj bhi samjhein humein paagal
Khud dhundein jawab, kyun puchun sawaal
Meri kya funny? Vehmo gumaan, kya dun main misaal?
Tu hai bemisaaal, har basti ujaagar

Mai urdu ka rakim, nazar badi qaatil
Hustle meri wazeh, gawah mera asim
Stranger than the main world, writing keeps on eating

Why is the date of time changing?
Maanegi woh apni ghalti nahi
Main aaj bhi wohi, koi jaldi nahi

복작대는 리듬 어쩌면
이 또한 또 다른 해금 (Woo, 해금)

쏟아지는 정보들은 상상의 자유들을
금지시킴과 동시에
사상의 통일성을 원해 (원해)
꽤나 머리 아픈 각종 노이즈는 눈을 가리고
이제는 생각의 자유조차 범해
각종 논란들은 판단들의 혼란들을
야기시키고 또 쉴 틈 없이 생산되네, uh
과연 우릴 금지시킨 건 무엇일까
어쩌면은 우리 자신 아닐까
자본의 노예, (Ayy) 돈들의 노예 (Ayy)
증오심과 편견 혐오의 노예 (Woo)
유튜브의 노예, (Yeah) 플렉스의 노예 (Yeah)
이기심과 탐욕이 미쳐 날뛰네 (Woo)
눈 감으면 편해 (Ayy) 모든 게 뻔해 (Ayy)
이득에 따라서 뻔히 갈리는 견해 (Woo)
시기와 질투에 다들 말야 눈들이 머네
서로가 서로에게 족쇄를 거는 것도 모른 채 (Ah)
정보의 쓰나미에서 쓸려 내려가지 말길
우린 자유와 방종의 차이쯤은 모두 구분하니

The pouring information gives freedom of imagination

Caused and produced without a break, uh
What really got us banned
maybe we are ourselves

Hatred and prejudice Slave to hate (Woo)
A slave to YouTube, (Yeah) a slave to Plex (Yeah)
Selfishness and greed run amok (Woo)
It's comfortable when I close my eyes (Ayy) Everything is obvious (Ayy)
Opinions clearly divided according to the gain (Woo)

I'm afraid that everything will disappear
Just trust me)

Baby, come and follow me
There's not a bad thing here tonight
Save your reasons all for later
Stay with me a little while

Watch me go
Now, I sink down, all alone away
Where am I?
A dark haze clouding up my eyes

I can hear the voices listening
Don't know who they are
Trying to take the pressure off
Been reaching for the stars
Tell me, will I find myself again?
When I go too far?
Yeah, I know
You know, I know (Ooh)

Lets go to the trailer park
You are the reason why i wrote this song
Suddenly i heard this peace of gong
I had been judged becouse im young
I know the whole world are addicted to the drama
Didn't predict any of this, tired of seeing this
We have talked a lot about how happiness comes from the inside
Remember when you had nine
Deep inside you know what's your goal line
I had been judged becouse i was on my stright line
Help me breath again

I need to be a leader all of my life
That's my mother and that's my ground
Don't wanna stuck in this underground
I can't change where i was grown
I remember when my birth date are today
Still remember this day's with no presents
When daddy don't wanna work, he stay within friends and get drunk
But mommy have no money, my birthday cake was bread with salami
You thought rap is shit, even don't heard this shit
I know how to control my hate, you can't rate it, cuz i love my mate
You might also likeThere is no limit where i can go
Peoples are experts at making something in nothing or starting judging
Everthing what they do are attacking, to my personal feelings
Jump in space ship, holocousts are allowed
Racism and classism are justified by our country
Really hope, Kanye West can reach this president chair
And Slim Shady will take his public speacher seat. -

Just awaken shaken once again, so you know it's on
Just awaken shaken once again, ho, you know it's on
Just awaken shaken once again, so you know it's on
Just awaken shaken once again, ho, you know it's on
Yeah, life
Life is the only thing we need
They need me to go, but I don't wanna leave
Rest in peace to Lil Keed

Fuck a pigeonhole, I'm a night owl, this a different mode
I might have to make her paint a 6 on her pinky toe
Heard you with a shooting guard, just let a nigga know
I would have you courtside, not the middle row
All good, love, in a minute, though
I can't strеss about no bitch 'cause I'm a timid soul
Plus I'm cookin' up ambition on a kitchen stove
Pot start to bubblе, see the suds, that shit good to go
Hoes say I'm suave, but I can't get RICO'd
Bro think he John Wayne, I bought him yellow stones
Love the way they hang, babe, fuck the silicone
Everybody fake now, you could crack the code
Bustdown everything, set in rose gold
Dread talkin' to you niggas like I'm J. Cole
I can tell her head good before I even know
Bitch, don't tell me that you model if you ain't been in Vogue
Gotta throw a party for my day ones
They ain't in the studio, but they'll lay somethin'
Rest in peace to Drama King, we was straight stuntin'
You don't like the way I talk? Nigga, say somethin'
Gotta throw a party for my day ones
Pull up and you know it's us, the bass jumpin'
You don't like the way I talk? Then say somethin'
Get out my face, nigga

Smack the backside of his head like he Bart (Pussy)
OVO 4L, we come out when it get dark (21, 21)
Big stepper, he came in a Rolls, but he left in a stretcher (21)
Let my brother drive while I shoot, team effort (21)
Askin' all these questions, bitch, you must think you Nadeska
The chopper like to feel on all the opps, it's a molester (21)
I be with my gun like Rozay be with lemon pepper
She wanna hear some Afrobeats 'cause she just popped a Tesla
All that workin' out, that nigga must think he a wrestler
But this ain't UFC, this chopper came with a compressor (21)
This chopper came with a compressor (Pussy)
This chopper came with a— (Pussy)
This Glock 45 came with a switch (21)
If I was Will Smith, I would've slapped him with a stick
Put your hands in the air, it's a stick-up (21)
Spin the same hood where I get my dick sucked (Facts)
If you standin' on business, put your blick up (21, 21)
Come around actin' scary, get your shit took (21)
Fell in love with feelin' dizzy, so I spizzin (21)
I got mad love for the boy, yeah, that's my twizzin (21)
If them niggas keep on dissin', slide agaizzin (21)
We the reason why the opps ain't got no frizziends (21)
Last nigga played with me got turned duppy
I ain't even roll him in the 'Wood 'cause he musty
You ask how she doin', I just tell her come and fuck me
Shot his ass twenty times, damn, this nigga lucky (Damn, that nigga lucky)

I found a love for me
Oh, darlin', just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me

'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But, darlin', just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holdin' mine

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darlin', you look perfect tonight

Well, I found a woman stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that, someday, I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
You might also like
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fightin' against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darlin', just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress, lookin' so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darlin', you look perfect tonight

No, no, no
Mm, no, no

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
We're barefoot on the grass, oh, listenin' to our favourite song
I have faith in what I see, now I know I have met
An angel in person and she looks perfect

Record man play my song on the radio
You too busy tryna find that blue-eyed soul
I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke
And I swear too much on the regular
We gon' let them hits fly, we gon' let it go
If it ain't XO, then it gotta go
I just won a new award for a kids show
Talkin' 'bout a face numbin' off a bag of blow
I'm like, goddamn, bitch, I am not a Teen Choice
Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy
Whip game, make a nigga understand though
Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo
Hit the gas so hard make it rotate
All my niggas blew up like a propane
All these R&B niggas be so lame
Got a sweet Asian chick, she go lo mein (Oh-oh-oh)

Platinum off a mixtape, sippin' on that codeine
Pour it in my trophies, roll until my nose bleed
I'ma keep on singin' while I'm burnin' up that OG
All my niggas get it, they make money all alone
Rock a chain around they neck, makin' sure I'm gettin' home
When I travel 'round the globe, make a couple mil' a show
And I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know
Used to walk 'round with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor
Now my shit straight, eatin' all day, tryna lose weight

Oh (jad vi bolna)
Oh (dil teh bolna)
Oh (jad vi bolna)
Oh (dil teh bolna)

Everybody tell me not to say it
Everybody tellin’ me to zip it up
At the same time
Everybody tellin’ me to stay safe
Everybody tellin’ me to keep it up
Maine kaday bandian’ch dekhi na sadaqat, think about it
Teray meray beech ki jo gal hai sari dunya ko ja ke kyun bata rahay ho?
Farigh ho
Haters they call me arrogant
Superego accelerant
It’s no accident that I’m better than, medicine
Chalain phir?
Kitni bari wohi baatain karein phir?
Jelly bruh?
Whatever!
Teray saray gaanay repetitive
Let me recalibrate
Mujjhay aik second dein
Bass in the beat
Make me celebrate
While you tasting defeat
Taking the heat, while I’m
Baking the meat
70 centigrade till it’s well done
You will see me seldom
Sabhi kehtay abhi phenko upar neechay album
Money making over the horizon
Competition going into hiding
While I’m on a mission
Ethay veri vi te changi tarhan milan
Penicillin nu vi pehlay ton hee pata si ke Faris on the mic
Is likely the illest
Yeh slightly hai villainous
And might need surveillance

Sun re

Teeraan vangu sidhiyaan samnay nazran rendeyaan meri
Mein na vekhaan sajjay khabbay
Mein andhi mein haneri
Teeraan vangu sidhiyaan samnay nazran rendeyaan meri
Mein na vekhaan sajjay khabbay
Mein andhi mein haneri
Jadd vee bolna
Dil teh bolna
Saanbh saki na duniya
Na duniya
Jadd vee bolna
Dil teh bolna
Saanbh saki na duniya
Na duniya

Sun re
Naya rukh chun re, chun re
Sun re
Reh na jana gum re, gum re

Nazreen o hazraat hazreen
Bradran e millat aap rakhay tashreef
Janaab e Ali
Janaaab e Aala
Janaab e Alam
Aur sari khawateen
All of the ladies
Muhatarma, follow me and dear
Muaziz Saarif
All the adeeb and musanifeen
Know what I mean when I scream
HELLOOO!
Faris like a virus in your system
Taray gin gin ke main saari raat
Taazi karoon yaadein
Saara din
Jaari karoon warrant
Maazi koh bhula dein
Kaisi thi voh pyaari pyaari bataain
Agar karoon ga mein focus teray saare vaaday bogus hon ge
Saaray khaatay kholus
Aur saaray gaanay chokus meray
Charon ore phirday reporters
Please no photos, theek hai jiggar
Speedain maar keh nikla mein
About to get a speeding ticket
Yeh joh inti yeh copy pe ye
Ghichmich hai
Gotta fidget with it cuz I need to paint a picture
Meray paas original
Literature
Aap ke paas cellular
Coverage hai
But don’t be callin’ me
And that’s the policy
I got a whole catalogue of people
That I just don’t wanna see
I sat along a tree
Jivain pipli da patt
Te saariyan tu pata ae
Edhi chaati chauri si
They just wanted me to stop the velocity
Oh, the audacity
Aisay nahi
Baaghi rooh koh kaisay tum sambhaalo ge?
Kis kis sanchay mein humain tum daaloh ge?
Ya buzdil reh ke apna aap nibhalo ge?
Jhuk jhuk ke phir kaisay sar utha lo ge?
Aji sun re
Haan, sun re
Aji sun re
Haan, sun re

Teeraan vangu sidhiyaan samnay nazran rendeyaan meri
Mein na vekhaan sajjay khabbay
Mein andhi mein haneri
Teeraan vangu sidhiyaan samnay nazran rendeyaan meri
Mein na vekhaan sajjay khabbay
Mein andhi mein haneri
(Faris Shafi: Haters they call me)

Everybody tell me not to say it
Everybody tellin' me to zip it up
At the same time
Everybody tellin' me to stay safe
Everybody tellin' me to keep it up
Maine kaday bandian'ch dekhi na sadaqat, think about it
You are my wife's wife, why are you going to leave the whole world?

Taking the heat while I'm

You'll see me rarely
Sabhi kehtay abhi phenko upar neechay album
Money making over the horizon
Competition going into hiding

184,184,184,Lost Stories,Mirza,"1 ContributorArabian Nights, Vol. 5 (Chap. 1) LyricsThe Ebony Horse.
There was once in times of yore and ages long gone before, a great and puissant King, of the Kings of the Persians, Sábúr by name, who was the richest of all the Kings in store of wealth and dominion and surpassed each and every in wit and wisdom. He was generous, open handed and beneficent, and he gave to those who sought him and repelled not those who resorted to him; and he comforted the broken-hearted and honourably entreated those who fled to him for refuge. Moreover, he loved the poor and was hospitable to strangers and did the oppressed justice upon the oppressor. He had three daughters, like full moons of shining light or flower-gardens blooming bright; and a son as he were the moon; and it was his wont to keep two festivals in the twelve- month, those of the Nau-Roz, or New Year, and Mihrgán the Autumnal Equinox, on which occasions he threw open his palaces and gave largesse and made proclamation of safety and security and promoted his chamberlains and viceroys; and the people of his realm came in to him and saluted him and gave him joy of the holy day, bringing him gifts and servants and eunuchs. Now he loved science and geometry, and one festival-day as he sat on his kingly throne there came in to him three wise men, cunning artificers and past masters in all manner of craft and inventions, skilled in making things curious and rare, such as confound the wit; and versed in the knowledge of occult truths and perfect in mysteries and subtleties. And they were of three different tongues and countries, the first a Hindi or Indian, the second a Roumi or Greek and the third a Farsi or Persian. The Indian came forwards and, prostrating himself before the King, wished him joy of the festival and laid before him a present befitting his dignity; that is to say, a man of gold, set with precious gems and jewels of price and hending in hand a golden trumpet. When Sabur saw this, he asked, ""O sage, what is the virtue of this figure?""; and the Indian answered, ""O my lord, if this figure be set at the gate of thy city, it will be a guardian over it; for, in an enemy enter the place, it will blow this clarion against him and he will be seized with a palsy and drop down dead."" Much the King marvelled at this and cried, ""By Allah, O sage, an this thy word be true, I will grant thee thy wish and thy desire."" Then came forward the Greek and, prostrating himself before the King, presented him with a basin of silver, in whose midst was a peacock of gold, surrounded by four-and-twenty chicks of the same metal. Sabur looked at them and turning to the Greek, said to him, ""O sage, what is the virtue of this peacock?"" ""O my lord,"" answered he, ""as often as an hour of the day or night passeth, it pecketh one of its young and crieth out and flappeth its wings, till the four-and-twenty hours are accomplished; and when the month cometh to an end, it will open its mouth and thou shalt see the crescent therein."" And the King said, ""An thou speak sooth, I will bring thee to thy wish and thy desire."" Then came forward the Persian sage and, prostrating himself before the King, presented him with a horse of the blackest ebony-wood inlaid with gold and jewels, and ready harnessed with saddle, bridle and stirrups such as befit Kings; which when Sabur saw, he marvelled with exceeding marvel and was confounded at the beauty of its form and the ingenuity of its fashion. So he asked, ""What is the use of this horse of wood, and what is its virtue and what the secret of its movement?""; and the Persian answered, ""O my lord, the virtue of this horse is that, if one mount him, it will carry him whither he will and fare with its rider through the air and cover the space of a year in a single day."" The King marvelled and was amazed at these three wonders, following thus hard upon one another on the same day, and turning to the sage, said to him, ""By Allah the Omnipotent, and our Lord the Beneficent, who created all creatures and feedeth them with meat and drink, an thy speech be veritable and the virtue of thy contrivance appear, I will assuredly give thee whatsoever thou lustest for and will bring thee to thy desire and thy wish!"" Then he entertained the sages three days, that he might make trial of their gifts; after which they brought the figures before him and each took the creature he had wroughten and showed him the mystery of its movement. The trumpeter blew the trump; the peacock pecked its chicks and the Persian sage mounted the ebony house, whereupon it soared with him high in air and descended again. When King Sabur saw all this, he was amazed and perplexed and felt like to fly for joy and said to the three sages, ""Now I am certified of the truth of your words and it behoveth me to quit me of my promise. Ask ye, therefore, what ye will, and I will give you that same."" Now the report of the King's daughters had reached the sages, so they answered, ""If the King be content with us and accept of our gifts and allow us to prefer a request to him, we crave of him that he give us his three daughters in marriage, that we may be his sons-in-law; for that the stability of Kings may not be gainsaid."" Quoth the King, ""I grant you that which you wish and you desire,"" and bade summon the Kazi forthright, that he might marry each of the sages to one of his daughters. Now it fortuned that the Princesses were behind a curtain, looking on; and when they heard this, the youngest considered her husband to be and behold, he was an old man, an hundred years of age, with hair frosted, forehead drooping, eyebrows mangy, ears slitten, beard and mustachios stained and dyed; eyes red and goggle; cheeks bleached and hollow; flabby nose like a brinjall, or egg- plant; face like a cobbler's apron, teeth overlapping and lips like camel's kidneys, loose and pendulous; in brief a terror, a horror, a monster, for he was of the folk of his time the unsightliest and of his age the frightfullest; sundry of his grinders had been knocked out and his eye-teeth were like the tusks of the Jinni who frighteneth poultry in hen-houses. Now the girl was the fairest and most graceful of her time, more elegant than the gazelle however tender, than the gentlest zephyr blander and brighter than the moon at her full; for amorous fray right suitable; confounding in graceful sway the waving bough and outdoing in swimming gait the pacing roe; in fine she was fairer and sweeter by far than all her sisters. So, when she saw her suitor, she went to her chamber and strewed dust on her head and tore her clothes and fell to buffeting her face and weeping and wailing. Now the Prince, her brother, Kamar al-Akmár, or the Moon of Moons hight, was then newly returned from a journey and, hearing her weeping and crying came in to her (for he loved her with fond affection, more than his other sisters) and asked her, ""What aileth thee? What hath befallen thee? Tell me and conceal naught from me."" So she smote her breast and answered, ""O my brother and my dear one, I have nothing to hide. If the palace be straitened upon thy father, I will go out; and if he be resolved upon a foul thing, I will separate myself from him, though he consent not to make provision for me; and my Lord will provide."" Quoth he, ""Tell me what meaneth this talk and what hath straitened thy breast and troubled thy temper."" ""O my brother and my dear one,"" answered the Princess, ""Know that my father hath promised me in marriage to a wicked magician who brought him, as a gift, a horse of black wood, and hath bewitched him with his craft and his egromancy; but, as for me, I will none of him, and would, because of him, I had never come into this world!"" Her brother soothed her and solaced her, then fared to his sire and said, ""What be this wizard to whom thou hast given my youngest sister in marriage, and what is this present which he hath brought thee, so that thou hast killed my sister with chagrin? It is not right that this should be."" Now the Persian was standing by and, when he heard the Prince's words, he was mortified and filled with fury and the King said, ""O my son, an thou sawest this horse, thy wit would be confounded and thou wouldst be amated with amazement."" Then he bade the slaves bring the horse before him and they did so; and, when the Prince saw it, it pleased him. So (being an accomplished cavalier) he mounted it forthright and struck its sides with the shovel-shaped stirrup-irons; but it stirred not and the King said to the Sage, ""Go show him its movement, that he also may help thee to win thy wish."" Now the Persian bore the Prince a grudge because he willed not he should have his sister; so he showed him the pin of ascent on the right side of the horse and saying to him, ""Trill this,"" left him. Thereupon the Prince trilled the pin and lo! the horse forthwith soared with him high in ether, as it were a bird, and gave not overflying till it disappeared from men's espying, whereat the King was troubled and perplexed about his case and said to the Persian, ""O sage, look how thou mayest make him descend."" But he replied, ""O my lord, I can do nothing, and thou wilt never see him again till Resurrection-day, for he, of his ignorance and pride, asked me not of the pin of descent and I forgot to acquaint him therewith."" When the King heard this, he was enraged with sore rage; and bade bastinado the sorcerer and clap him in jail, whilst he himself cast the crown from his head and beat his face and smote his breast. Moreover, he shut the doors of his palaces and gave himself up to weeping and keening, he and his wife and daughters and all the folk of the city; and thus their joy was turned to annoy and their gladness changed into sore affliction and sadness. Thus far concerning them; but as regards the Prince, the horse gave not over soaring with him till he drew near the sun, whereat he gave himself up for lost and saw death in the skies, and was confounded at his case, repenting him of having mounted the horse and saying to himself, ""Verily, this was a device of the Sage to destroy me on account of my youngest sister; but there is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! I am lost without recourse; but I wonder, did not he who made the ascent-pin make also a descent-pin?"" Now he was a man of wit and knowledge and intelligence; so he fell to feeling all the parts of the horse, but saw nothing save a screw, like a cock's head, on its right shoulder and the like on the left, when quoth he to himself, ""I see no sign save these things like buttons."" Presently he turned the right-hand pin, whereupon the horse flew heavenwards with increased speed. So he left it and looking at the sinister shoulder and finding another pin, he wound it up and immediately the steed's upwards motion slowed and ceased and it began to descend, little by little, towards the face of the earth, while the rider became yet more cautious and careful of his life.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Three Hundred and Fifty-eighth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Prince wound up the sinister screw, the steed's upward motion slowed and ceased, and it began to descend, little by little, towards the earth while the rider became yet more cautious and careful of his life. And when he saw this and knew the uses of the horse, his heart was filled with joy and gladness and he thanked Almighty Allah for that He had deigned deliver him from destruction. Then he began to turn the horse's head whithersoever he would, making it rise and fall at pleasure, till he had gotten complete mastery over its every movement. He ceased not to descend the whole of that day, for that the steed's ascending flight had borne him afar from the earth; and, as he descended, he diverted himself with viewing the various cities and countries over which he passed and which he knew not, never having seen them in his life. Amongst the rest, he descried a city ordered after the fairest fashion in the midst of a verdant and riant land, rich in trees and streams, with gazelles pacing daintily over the plains; whereat he fell a-musing and said to himself, ""Would I knew the name of yon town and in what land it is!"" And he took to circling about it and observing it right and left. By this time, the day began to decline and the sun drew near to its downing; and he said in his mind, ""Verily I find no goodlier place to night in than this city; so I will lodge here and early on the morrow I will return to my kith and kin and my kingdom; and tell my father and family what hath passed and acquaint him with what mine eyes have seen."" Then he addressed himself to seeking a place wherein he might safely bestow himself and his horse and where none should descry him, and presently behold, he espied a-middlemost of the city a palace rising high in upper air surrounded by a great wall with lofty crenelles and battlements, guarded by forty black slaves, clad in complete mail and armed with spears and swords, bows and arrows. Quoth he, ""This is a goodly place,"" and turned the descent-pin, whereupon the horse sank down with him like a weary bird, and alighted gently on the terrace-roof of the palace. So the Prince dismounted and ejaculating ""Alhamdolillah""—praise be to Allah—he began to go round about the horse and examine it, saying, ""By Allah, he who fashioned thee with these perfections was a cunning craftsman, and if the Almighty extend the term of my life and restore me to my country and kinsfolk in safety and reunite me with my father, I will assuredly bestow upon him all manner bounties and benefit him with the utmost beneficence."" By this time night had overtaken him and he sat on the roof till he was assured that all in the palace slept; and indeed hunger and thirst were sore upon him, for that he had not tasted food nor drunk water since he parted from his sire. So he said within himself, ""Surely the like of this palace will not lack of victual;"" and, leaving the horse above, went down in search of somewhat to eat. Presently, he came to a staircase and descending it to the bottom, found himself in a court paved with white marble and alabaster, which shone in the light of the moon. He marvelled at the place and the goodliness of its fashion, but sensed no sound of speaker and saw no living soul and stood in perplexed surprise, looking right and left and knowing not whither he should wend. Then said he to himself, ""I may not do better than return to where I left my horse and pass the night by it; and as soon as day shall dawn I will mount and ride away.""— And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Three Hundred and Fifty-ninth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that quoth the king's son to himself, ""I may not do better than pass the night by my horse; and as soon as day shall dawn I will mount and ride away."" However, as he tarried talking to himself, he espied a light within the palace, and making towards it, found that it came from a candle that stood before a door of the Harim, at the head of a sleeping eunuch, as he were one of the Ifrits of Solomon or a tribesman of the Jinn, longer than lumber and broader than a bench. He lay before the door, with the pommel of his sword gleaming in the flame of the candle, and at his head was a bag of leather hanging from a column of granite. When the Prince saw this, he was affrighted and said, ""I crave help from Allah the Supreme! O mine Holy One, even as Thou hast already delivered me from destruction, so vouchsafe me strength to quit myself of the adventure of this palace!"" So saying, he put out his hand to the budget and taking it, carried it aside and opened it and found in it food of the best. He ate his fill and refreshed himself and drank water, after which he hung up the provision-bag in its place and drawing the eunuch's sword from its sheath, took it, whilst the slave slept on, knowing not whence destiny should come to him. Then the Prince fared forwards into the palace and ceased not till he came to a second door, with a curtain drawn before it; so he raised the curtain and behold, on entering he saw a couch of the whitest ivory, inlaid with pearls and jacinths and jewels, and four slave-girls sleeping about it. He went up to the couch, to see what was thereon, and found a young lady lying asleep, chemised with her hair as she were the full moon rising over the Eastern horizon, with flower-white brow and shining hair-paring and cheeks like blood-red anemones and dainty moles thereon. He was amazed at her as she lay in her beauty and loveliness, her symmetry and grace, and he recked no more of death. So he went up to her, trembling in every nerve and, shuddering with pleasure, kissed her on the right cheek; whereupon she awoke forthright and opened her eyes, and seeing the Prince standing at her head, said to him, ""Who art thou and whence comest thou?"" Quoth he, ""I am thy slave and thy lover."" Asked she, ""And who brought thee hither?"" and he answered, ""My Lord and my fortune."" Then said Shams al-Nahár (for such was her name), ""Haply thou art he who demanded me yesterday of my father in marriage and he rejected thee, pretending that thou wast foul of favour. By Allah, my sire lied in his throat when he spoke this thing, for thou art not other than beautiful."" Now the son of the King of Hind had sought her in marriage, but her father had rejected him, for that he was ugly and uncouth, and she thought the Prince was he. So, when she saw his beauty and grace (for indeed he was like the radiant moon) the syntheism of love gat hold of her heart as it were a flaming fire, and they fell to talk and converse. Suddenly, her waiting-women awoke and, seeing the Prince with their mistress, said to her, ""Oh my lady, who is this with thee?"" Quoth she, ""I know not; I found him sitting by me, when I woke up: haply 'tis he who seeketh me in marriage of my sire."" Quoth they, ""O my lady, by Allah the All-Father, this is not he who seeketh thee in marriage, for he is hideous and this man is handsome and of high degree. Indeed, the other is not fit to be his servant."" Then the handmaidens went out to the eunuch, and finding him slumbering awoke him, and he started up in alarm. Said they, ""How happeth it that thou art on guard at the palace and yet men come in to us, whilst we are asleep?"" When the black heard this, he sprang in haste to his sword, but found it not; and fear took him and trembling. Then he went in, confounded, to his mistress and seeing the Prince sitting at talk with her, said to him, ""O my lord, art thou man or Jinni?"" Replied the Prince, ""Woe to thee, O unluckiest of slaves: how darest thou even the sons of the royal Chosroes with one of the unbelieving Satans?"" And he was as a raging lion. Then he took the sword in his hand and said to the slave, ""I am the King's son-in-law, and he hath married me to his daughter and bidden me go in to her."" And when the eunuch heard these words he replied, ""O my lord, if thou be indeed of kind a man as thou avouchest, she is fit for none but for thee, and thou art worthier of her than any other."" Thereupon the eunuch ran to the King, shrieking loud and rending his raiment and heaving dust upon his head; and when the King heard his outcry, he said to him, ""What hath befallen thee?: speak quickly and be brief; for thou hast fluttered my heart."" Answered the eunuch, ""O King, come to thy daughter's succour; for a devil of the Jinn, in the likeness of a King's son, hath got possession of her; so up and at him!"" When the King heard this, he thought to kill him and said, ""How camest thou to be careless of my daughter and let this demon come at her?"" Then he betook himself to the Princess's palace, where he found her slave-women standing to await him and asked them, ""What is come to my daughter?"" ""O King,"" answered they, ""slumber overcame us and, when we awoke, we found a young man sitting upon her couch in talk with her, as he were the full moon; never saw we aught fairer of favour than he. So we questioned him of his case and he declared that thou hadst given him thy daughter in marriage. More than this we know not, nor do we know if he be a man or a Jinni; but he is modest and well bred, and doth nothing unseemly or which leadeth to disgrace."" Now when the King heard these words, his wrath cooled and he raised the curtain little by little and looking in, saw sitting at talk with his daughter a Prince of the goodliest with a face like the full moon for sheen. At this sight he could not contain himself, of his jealousy for his daughter's honour; and, putting aside the curtain, rushed in upon them drawn sword in hand like a furious Ghul. Now when the Prince saw him he asked the Princess, ""Is this thy sire?""; and she answered, ""Yes.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Three Hundred and Sixtieth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Price saw the King rushing in upon them, drawn sword in hand, like a furious Ghul he asked the Princess, ""Is this thy sire?""; and she answered, ""Yes."" Whereupon he sprang to his feet and, seizing his sword, cried out at the King with so terrible a cry that he was confounded. Then the youth would have fallen on him with the sword; but the King seeing that the Prince was doughtier than he, sheathed his scymitar and stood till the young man came up to him, when he accosted him courteously and said to him, ""O youth, art thou a man or a Jinni?"" Quoth the Prince, ""Did I not respect thy right as mine host and thy daughter's honour, I would spill thy blood! How darest thou fellow me with devils, me that am a Prince of the sons of the royal Chosroes who, had they wished to take thy kingdom, could shake thee like an earthquake from thy glory and thy dominions and spoil thee of all thy possessions?"" Now when the King heard his words, he was confounded with awe and bodily fear of him and rejoined, ""If thou indeed be of the sons of the Kings, as thou pretendest, how cometh it that thou enterest my palace without my permission, and smirchest mine honour, making thy way to my daughter and feigning that thou art her husband and claiming that I have given her to thee to wife, I that have slain Kings and Kings' sons, who sought her of me in marriage? And now who shall save thee from my might and majesty when, if I cried out to my slaves and servants and bade them put thee to the vilest of deaths they would slay thee forthright? Who shall deliver thee out of my hand?"" When the Prince heard this speech of the King he answered, ""Verily, I wonder at thee and at the shortness and denseness of thy wit! Say me, canst covet for thy daughter a mate comelier than myself, and hast ever seen a stouter hearted man or one better fitted for a Sultan or a more glorious in rank and dominion than I?"" Rejoined the King, ""Nay, by Allah! but I would have had thee, O youth, act after the custom of Kings and demand her from me to wife before witnesses, that I might have married her to thee publicly; and now, even were I to marry her to thee privily, yet hast thou dishonoured me in her person."" Rejoined the Prince, ""Thou sayest sooth, O King, but if thou summon thy slaves and thy soldiers and they fall upon me and slay me, as thou pretendest, thou wouldst but publish thine own disgrace, and the folk would be divided between belief in thee and disbelief in thee. Wherefore, O King, thou wilt do well, meseemeth, to turn from this thought to that which I shall counsel thee."" Quoth the King, ""Let me hear what thou hast to advise;"" and quoth the Prince, ""What I have to propose to thee is this: either do thou meet me in combat singular, I and thou; and he who slayeth his adversary shall be held the worthier and having a better title to the kingdom; or else, let me be this night and, whenas dawns the morn, draw out against me thy horsemen and footmen and servants; but first tell me their number."" Said the King, ""They are forty thousand horse, beside my own slaves and their followers, who are the like of them in number."" Thereupon said the Prince, ""When the day shall break, do thou array them against me and say to them""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Three Hundred and Sixty-first Night,
She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that quoth the Prince, ""When day shall break, do thou array them against me and say to them: 'This man is a suitor to me for my daughter's hand, on condition that he shall do battle single-handed against you all; for he pretendeth that he will overcome you and put you to the rout, and indeed that ye cannot prevail against him.' After which, leave me to do battle with them: if they slay me, then is thy secret surer guarded and thine honour the better warded; and if I overcome them and see their backs, then is it the like of me a King should covet to his son-in-law."" So the King approved of his opinion and accepted his proposition, despite his awe at the boldness of his speech and amaze at the pretensions of the Prince to meet in fight his whole host, such as he had described to him, being at heart assured that he would perish in the fray and so he should be quit of him and freed from the fear of dishonour. Thereupon he called the eunuch and bade him go to his Wazir without stay and delay and command him to assemble the whole of the army and cause them don their arms and armour and mount their steeds. So the eunuch carried the King's order to the Minister, who straightaway summoned the Captains of the host and the Lords of the realm and bade them don their harness of derring-do and mount horse and sally forth in battle array. Such was their case; but as regards the King, he sat a long while conversing with the young Prince, being pleased with his wise speech and good sense and fine breeding. And when it was day-break he returned to his palace and, seating himself on his throne, commanded his merry men to mount and bade them saddle one of the best of the royal steeds with handsome selle and housings and trappings and bring it to the Prince. But the youth said, ""O King, I will not mount horse, till I come in view of the troops and review them."" ""Be it as thou wilt,"" replied the King. Then the two repaired to the parade-ground, where the troops were drawn up, and the young Prince looked upon them and noted their great number; after which the King cried out to them, saying, ""Ho, all ye men, there is come to me a youth who seeketh my daughter in marriage; and in very sooth never have I seen a goodlier than he; no, nor a stouter of heart nor a doughtier of arm, for he pretendeth that he can overcome you, single-handed, and force you to flight and that, were ye an hundred thousand in number, yet for him would ye be but few. Now when he chargeth down on you, do ye receive him upon point of pike and sharp of sabre; for, indeed, he hath undertaken a mighty matter."" Then quoth the King to the Prince, ""Up, O my son, and do thy devoir on them."" Answered he, ""O King, thou dealest not justly and fairly by me: how shall I go forth against them, seeing that I am afoot and the men be mounted?"" The King retorted, ""I bade thee mount, and thou refusedst; but choose thou which of my horses thou wilt."" Then he said, ""Not one of thy horses pleaseth me, and I will ride none but that on which I came."" Asked the King, ""And where is thy horse?"" ""Atop of thy palace."" ""In what part of my palace?"" ""On the roof."" Now when the King heard these words, he cried, ""Out on thee! this is the first sign thou hast given of madness. How can the horse be on the roof? But we shall at once see if thou speak the truth or lies."" Then he turned to one of his chief officers and said to him, ""Go to my palace and bring me what thou findest on the roof."" So all the people marvelled at the young Prince's words, saying one to other, ""How can a horse come down the steps from the roof? Verily this is a thing whose like we never heard."" In the meantime the King's messenger repaired to the palace and mounting to the roof, found the horse standing there and never had he looked on a handsomer; but when he drew near and examined it, he saw that it was made of ebony and ivory. Now the officer was accompanied by other high officers, who also looked on and they laughed to one another, saying, ""Was it of the like of this horse that the youth spake? We cannot deem him other than mad; however, we shall soon see the truth of his case.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Three Hundred and Sixty-second Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the high officials looked upon the horse, they laughed one to other and said, ""Was it of the like of his horse that the youth spake? We cannot deem him other than mad; however, we shall soon see the truth of his case. Peradventure herein is some mighty matter, and he is a man of high degree."" Then they lifted up the horse bodily and, carrying it to the King, set it down before him, and all the lieges flocked round to look at it, marvelling at the beauty of its proportions and the richness of its saddle and bridle. The King also admired it and wondered at it with extreme wonder; and he asked the Prince, ""O youth, is this thy horse?"" He answered, ""Yes, O King, this is my horse, and thou shalt soon see the marvel it showeth."" Rejoined the King, ""Then take and mount it,"" and the Prince retorted, ""I will not mount till the troops withdraw afar from it."" So the King bade them retire a bowshot from the horse; whereupon quoth its owner, ""O King, see thou; I am about to mount my horse and charge upon thy host and scatter them right and left and split their hearts asunder."" Said the King, ""Do as thou wilt; and spare not their lives, for they will not spare thine."" Then the Prince mounted, whilst the troops ranged themselves in ranks before him, and one said to another, ""When the youth cometh between the ranks, we will take him on the points of our pikes and the sharps of our sabres."" Quoth another, ""By Allah, this a mere misfortune: how shall we slay a youth so comely of face and shapely of form?"" And a third continued, ""Ye will have hard work to get the better of him; for the youth had not done this, but for what he knew of his own prowess and pre- eminence of valour."" Meanwhile, having settled himself in his saddle, the Prince turned the pin of ascent; whilst all eyes were strained to see what he would do, whereupon the horse began to heave and rock and sway to and fro and make the strangest of movements steed ever made, till its belly was filled with air and it took flight with its rider and soared high into the sky. When the King saw this, he cried out to his men, saying, ""Woe to you! catch him, catch him, ere he 'scape you!"" But his Wazirs and Viceroys said to him, ""O King, can a man overtake the flying bird? This is surely none but some mighty magician or Marid of the Jinn or devil, and Allah save thee from him. So praise thou the Almighty for deliverance of thee and of all thy host from his hand."" Then the King returned to his palace after seeing the feat of the Prince and, going in to his daughter, acquainted her with what had befallen them both on the parade-ground. He found her grievously afflicted for the Prince and bewailing her separation from him; wherefore she fell sick with violent sickness and took to her pillow. Now when her father saw her on this wise, he pressed her to his breast and kissing her between the eyes, said to her, ""O my daughter, praise Allah Almighty and thank Him for that He hath delivered us from this crafty enchanter, this villain, this low fellow, this thief who thought only of seducing thee!"" And he repeated to her the story of the Prince and how he had disappeared in the firmament; and he abused him and cursed him knowing not how dearly his daughter loved him. But she paid no heed to his words and did but redouble in her tears and wails, saying to herself, ""By Allah, I will neither eat meat nor drain drink, till Allah reunite me with him!"" Her father was greatly concerned for her case and mourned much over her plight; but, for all he could do to soother her, love-longing only increased on her.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Three Hundred and Sixty-third Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the King mourned much over his daughter's plight but, for all he could do to soothe her, love-longing only increased on her. Thus far concerning the King and Princess Shams al-Nahár; but as regards Prince Kamar al-Akmar, when he had risen high in air, he turned his horse's head towards his native land, and being alone mused upon the beauty of the Princess and her loveliness. Now he had enquired of the King's people the name of the city and of its King and his daughter; and men had told him that it was the city of Sana'á. So he journeyed with all speed, till he drew near his father's capital and, making an airy circuit about the city, alighted on the roof of the King's palace, where he left his horse, whilst he descended into the palace and seeing its threshold strewn with ashes, though that one of his family was dead. Then he entered, as of wont, and found his father and mother and sisters clad in mourning raiment of black, all pale of faces and lean of frames. When his sire descried him and was assured that it was indeed his son, he cried out with a great cry and fell down in a fit, but after a time coming to himself, threw himself upon him and embraced him, clipping him to his bosom and rejoicing in him with exceeding joy and extreme gladness. His mother and sisters heard this; so they came in and seeing the Prince, fell upon him, kissing him and weeping, and joying with exceeding joyance. Then they questioned him of his case; so he told them all that had passed from first to last, and his father said to him, ""Praised be Allah for thy safety, O coolth of my eyes and core of my heart!"" Then the King bade hold high festival, and the glad tidings flew through the city. So they beat drums and cymbals and, doffing the weed of mourning, they donned the gay garb of gladness and decorated the streets and markets; whilst the folk vied with one another who should be the first to give the King joy, and the King proclaimed a general pardon and opening the prisons, released those who were therein prisoned. Moreover, he made banquets for the people, with great abundance of eating and drinking, for seven days and nights and all creatures were gladsomest; and he took horse with his son and rode out with him, that the folk might see him and rejoice. After awhile the Prince asked about the maker of the horse, saying, ""O my father, what hath fortune done with him?""; and the King answered, ""Allah never bless him nor the hour wherein I set eyes on him! For he was the cause of thy separation from us, O my son, and he hath lain in gaol since the day of thy disappearance."" Then the King bade release him from prison and, sending for him, invested him in a dress of satisfaction and entreated him with the utmost favour and munificence, save that he would not give him his daughter to wife; whereat the Sage raged with sore rage and repented of that which he had done, knowing that the Prince had secured the secret of the steed and the manner of its motion. Moreover, the King said to his son, ""I reck thou wilt do will not to go near the horse henceforth and more especially not to mount it after this day; for thou knowest not its properties, and belike thou art in error about it."" Not the Prince had told his father of his adventure with the King of Sana'a and his daughter and he said, ""Had the King intended to kill thee, he had done so; but thine hour was not yet come."" When the rejoicings were at an end, the people returned to their places and the King and his son to the palace, where they sat down and fell to eating and drinking and making merry. Now the King had a handsome handmaiden who was skilled in playing the lute; so she took it and began to sweep the strings and sing thereto before the King and his son of separation of lovers, and she chanted the following verses:—
""Deem not that absence breeds in me aught of forgetfulness; *
       &nbsp     What should remember I did you fro' my remembrance wane?
Time dies but never dies the fondest love for you we bear; *
       &nbsp     And in your love I'll die and in your love I'll arise
       &nbsp     again.""
When the Prince heard these verses, the fires of longing flamed up in his heart and pine and passion redoubled upon him. Grief and regret were sore upon him and his bowels yearned in him for love of the King's daughter of Sana'a; so he rose forthright and, escaping his father's notice, went forth the palace to the horse and mounting it, turned the pin of ascent, whereupon bird-like it flew with him high in air and soared towards the upper regions of the sky. In early morning his father missed him and, going up to the pinnacle of the palace, in great concern, saw his son rising into the firmament; whereat he was sore afflicted and repented in all penitence that he had not taken the horse and hidden it; and he said to himself, ""By Allah, if but my son return to me, I will destroy the horse, that my heart may be at rest concerning my son."" And he fell again to weeping and bewailing himself.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Three Hundred and Sixty-fourth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the King again fell to weeping and bewailing himself for his son. Such was his case; but as regards the Prince, he ceased not flying on through air till he came to the city of Sana'a and alighted on the roof as before. Then he crept down stealthily and, finding the eunuch asleep, as of wont, raised the curtain and went on little by little, till he came to the door of the Princess's alcove-chamber and stopped to listen; when lo! he heard her shedding plenteous tears and reciting verses, whilst her women slept round her. Presently, overhearing her weeping and wailing quoth they, ""O our mistress, why wilt thou mourn for one who mourneth not for thee?"" Quoth she, ""O ye little of wit, is he for whom I mourn of those who forget or who are forgotten?"" And she fell again to wailing and weeping, till sleep overcame her. Hereat the Prince's heart melted for her and his gall-bladder was like to burst, so he entered and, seeing her lying asleep without covering, touched her with his hand; whereupon she opened her eyes and espied him standing by her. Said he, ""Why all this crying and mourning?"" And when she knew him, she threw herself upon him, and took him around the neck and kissed him and answered, ""For thy sake and because of my separation from thee."" Said he, ""O my lady, I have been made desolate by thee all this long time!"" But she replied, ""'Tis thou who hast desolated me; and hadst thou tarried longer, I had surely died!"" Rejoined he, ""O my lady, what thinkest thou of my case with thy father and how he dealt with me? Were it not for my love of thee, O temptation and seduction of the Three Worlds, I had certainly slain him and made him a warning to all beholders; but, even as I love thee, so I love him for thy sake."" Quoth she, ""How couldst thou leave me: can my life be sweet to me after thee?"" Quoth he, ""Let what hath happened suffice: I am now hungry, and thirsty."" So she bade her maidens make ready meat and drink, and they sat eating and drinking and conversing till night was well nigh ended; and when day broke he rose to take leave of her and depart, ere the eunuch should awake. Shams al-Nahar asked him, ""Whither goest thou?""; and he answered, ""To my father's house, and I plight thee my troth that I will come to thee once in every week."" But she wept and said, ""I conjure thee, by Allah the Almighty, take me with thee whereso thou wendest and make me not taste anew the bittergourd of separation from thee."" Quoth he, ""Wilt thou indeed go with me?"" and quoth she, ""Yes."" ""Then,"" said he, ""arise that we depart."" So she rose forthright and going to a chest, arrayed herself in what was richest and dearest to her of her trinkets of gold and jewels of price, and she fared forth, her handmaids recking naught. So he carried her up to the roof of the palace and, mounting the ebony horse, took her up behind him and made her fast to himself, binding her with strong bonds; after which he turned the shoulder-pin of ascent, and the horse rose with him high in air. When her slave-women saw this, they shrieked aloud and told her father and mother, who in hot haste ran to the palace-roof and looking up, saw the magical horse flying away with the Prince and Princess. At this the King was troubled with ever-increasing trouble and cried out, saying, ""O King's son, I conjure thee, by Allah, have ruth on me and my wife and bereave us not of our daughter!"" The Prince made him no reply; but, thinking in himself that the maiden repented of leaving father and mother, asked her, ""O ravishment of the age, say me, wilt thou that I restore thee to thy mother and father?"": whereupon she answered, ""By Allah, O my lord, that is not my desire: my only wish is to be with thee, wherever thou art; for I am distracted by the love of thee from all else, even from my father and mother."" Hearing these words the Prince joyed with great joy, and made the horse fly and fare softly with them, so as not to disquiet her; nor did they stay their flight till they came in sight of a green meadow, wherein was a spring of running water. Here they alighted and ate and drank; after which the Prince took horse again and set her behind him, binding her in his fear for her safety; after which they fared on till they came in sight of his father's capital. At this, the Prince was filled with joy and bethought himself to show his beloved the seat of his dominion and his father's power and dignity and give her to know that it was greater than that of her sire. So he set her down in one of his father's gardens without the city where his parent was wont to take his pleasure; and, carrying her into a domed summer-house prepared there for the King, left the ebony horse at the door and charged the damsel keep watch over it, saying, ""Sit here, till my messenger come to thee; for I go now to my father, to make ready a palace for thee and show thee my royal estate."" She was delighted when she heard these words and said to him, ""Do as thou wilt;""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Three Hundred and Sixty-fifth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the maiden was delighted when she heard these words and said to him, ""Do as thou wilt;"" for she thereby understood that she should not enter the city but with due honour and worship, as became her rank. Then the Prince left her and betook himself to the palace of the King his father, who rejoiced in his return and met him and welcomed him; and the Prince said to him, ""Know that I have brought with me the King's daughter of whom I told thee; and have left her without the city in such a garden and come to tell thee, that thou mayst make ready the procession of estate and go forth to meet her and show her thy royal dignity and troops and guards."" Answered the King, ""With joy and gladness""; and straightaway bade decorate the town with the goodliest adornment. Then he took horse and rode out in all magnificence and majesty, he and his host, high officers and household, with drums and kettle-drums, fifes and clarions and all manner instruments; whilst the Prince drew forth of his treasuries jewellery and apparel and what else of the things which Kings hoards and made a rare display of wealth and splendour: moreover he got ready for the Princess a canopied litter of brocades, green, red and yellow, wherein he set Indian and Greek and Abyssinian slave- girls. Then he left the litter and those who were therein and preceded them to the pavilion where he had set her down; and searched but found naught, neither Princess nor horse. When he saw this, he beat his face, and rent his raiment and began to wander round about the garden, as he had lost his wits; after which he came to his senses and said to himself, ""How could she have come at the secret of this horse, seeing I told her nothing of it? Maybe the Persian sage who made the horse hath chanced upon her and stolen her away, in revenge for my father's treatment of him."" Then he sought the guardians of the garden and asked them if they had seen any pass the precincts; and said, ""Hath any one come in here? Tell me the truth and the whole truth or I will at once strike off your heads."" They were terrified by his threats; but they answered with one voice, ""We have seen no man enter save the Persian sage, who came to gather healing herbs."" So the Prince was certified that it was indeed he that had taken away the maiden,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Three Hundred and Sixty-sixth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Prince heard their answer, he was certified that the Sage had taken away the maiden and abode confounded and perplexed concerning his case. And he was abashed before the folk and, turning to his sire, told him what had happened and said to him, ""Take the troops and march them back to the city. As for me, I will never return till I have cleared up this affair."" When the King heard this, he wept and beat his breast and said to him, ""O my son, calm thy choler and master thy chagrin and come home with us and look what King's daughter thou wouldst fain have, that I may marry thee to her."" But the Prince paid no heed to his words and farewelling him departed, whilst the King returned to the city and their joy was changed into sore annoy. Now, as Destiny issued her decree, when the Prince left the Princess in the garden-house and betook himself to his father's palace, for the ordering of his affair, the Persian entered the garden to pluck certain simples and, scenting the sweet savour of musk and perfumes that exhaled from the Princess and impregnated the whole place, followed it till he came to the pavilion and saw standing at the door the horse which he had made with his own hands. His heart was filled with joy and gladness, for he had bemourned its loss much since it had gone out of his hand: so he went up to it and, examining its every part, found it whole and sound; whereupon he was about to mount and ride away, when he bethought himself and said, ""Needs must I first look what the Prince hath brought and left here with the horse."" So he entered the pavilion and, seeing the Princess sitting there, as she were the sun shining sheen in the sky serene, knew her at the first glance to be some high-born lady and doubted not but the Prince had brought her thither on the horse and left her in the pavilion, whilst he went to the city, to make ready for her entry in state procession with all splendor. Then he went up to her and kissed the earth between her hands, whereupon she raised her eyes to him and, finding him exceedingly foul of face and favour, asked, ""Who art thou?""; and he answered, ""O my lady, I am a messenger sent by the Prince who hath bidden me bring thee to another pleasance nearer the city; for that my lady the Queen cannot walk so far and is unwilling, of her joy in thee, that another should forestall her with thee."" Quoth she, ""Where is the Prince?""; and quoth the Persian, ""He is in the city, with his sire and forthwith he shall come for thee in great state."" Said she, ""O thou! say me, could he find none handsomer to send to me?""; whereat loud laughed the Sage and said, ""Yea verily, he hath not a Mameluke as ugly as I am; but, O my lady, let not the ill-favour of my face and the foulness of my form deceive thee. Hadst thou profited of me as hath the Prince, verily thou wouldst praise my affair. Indeed, he chose me as his messenger to thee, because of my uncomeliness and loathsomeness in his jealous love of thee; else hath he Mamelukes and negro slaves, pages, eunuchs and attendants out of number, each goodlier than other."" Whenas she heard this, it commended itself to her reason and she believed him; so she rose forthright;—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Three Hundred and Sixty-seventh Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Persian sage acquainted the Princess with the case of the King's son, she believed him; so she rose forthright; and, putting her hand in his, said, ""O my father, what hast thou brought me to ride?"" He replied, ""O my lady, thou shalt ride the horse thou camest on;"" and she, ""I cannot ride it by myself."" Whereupon he smiled and knew that he was her master and said, ""I will ride with thee myself."" So he mounted and, taking her up behind him bound her to himself with firm bonds, while she knew not what he would with her. Then he turned the ascent-pin, whereupon the belly of the horse became full of wind and it swayed to and fro like a wave of the sea, and rose with them high in air nor slackened in its flight, till it was out of sight of the city. Now when Shams al-Nahir saw this, she asked him, ""Ho thou! what is become of that thou toldest me of my Prince, making me believe that he sent thee to me?"" Answered the Persian, ""Allah damn the Prince! he is a mean and skin-flint knave."" She cried, ""Woe to thee! How darest thou disobey thy lord's commandment?"" Whereto the Persian replied, ""He is no lord of mine: knowest thou who I am?"" Rejoined the Princess, ""I know nothing of thee save what thou toldest me;"" and retorted he, ""What I told thee was a trick of mine against thee and the King's son: I have long lamented the loss of this horse which is under us; for I constructed it and made myself master of it. But now I have gotten firm hold of it and of thee too, and I will burn his heart even as he hath burnt mine; nor shall he ever have the horse again; no, never! So be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear; for I can be of more use to thee than he; and I am generous as I am wealthy; my servants and slaves shall obey thee as their mistress; I will robe thee in finest raiment and thine every wish shall be at thy will."" When she heard this, she buffeted her face and cried out, saying, ""Ah, well-away! I have not won my beloved and I have lost my father and mother!"" And she wept bitter tears over what had befallen her, whilst the Sage fared on with her, without ceasing, till he came to the land of the Greeks and alighted in a verdant mead, abounding in streams and trees. Now this meadow lay near a city wherein was a King of high puissance, and it chanced that he went forth that day to hunt and divert himself. As he passed by the meadow, he saw the Persian standing there, with the damsel and the horse by his side; and, before the Sage was ware, the King's slaves fell upon him and carried him and the lady and the horse to their master who, noting the foulness of the man's favour and his loathsomeness and the beauty of the girl and her loveliness, said, ""O my lady, what kin is this oldster to thee?"" The Persian made haste to reply, saying, ""She is my wife and the daughter of my father's brother."" But the lady at once gave him the lie and said, ""O King, by Allah, I know him not, nor is he my husband; nay, he is a wicked magician who hath stolen me away by force and fraud."" Thereupon the King bade bastinado the Persian and they beat him till he was well-nigh dead; after which the King commanded to carry him to the city and cast him into jail; and, taking from him the damsel and the ebony horse (though he knew not its properties nor the secret of its motion), set the girl in his serraglio and the horse amongst his hoards. Such was the case with the Sage and the lady; but as regards Prince Kamar al-Akmar, he garbed himself in travelling gear and taking what he needed of money, set out tracking their trail in very sorry plight; and journeyed from country to country and city to city seeking the Princess and enquiring after the ebony horse, whilst all who heard him marvelled at him and deemed his talk extravagant. Thus he continued doing a long while; but, for all his enquiry and quest, he could hit on no new news of her. At last he came to her father's city of Sana'a and there asked for her, but could get no tidings of her and found her father mourning her loss. So he turned back and made for the land of the Greeks, continuing to enquire concerning the twain as he went,— And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Three Hundred and Sixty-eighth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the King's son made for the land of the Greeks, continuing to enquire concerning the two as he went along, till, as chance would have it, he alighted at a certain Khan and saw a company of merchants sitting at talk. So he sat down near them and heard one say, ""O my friends, I lately witnessed a wonder of wonders."" They asked, ""What was that?"" and he answered, ""I was visiting such a district in such a city (naming the city wherein was the Princess), and I heard its people chatting of a strange thing which had lately befallen. It was that their King went out one day hunting and coursing with a company of his courtiers and the lords of his realm; and, issuing from the city, they came to a green meadow where they espied an old man standing, with a woman sitting hard by a horse of ebony. The man was foulest-foul of face and loathly of form, but the woman was a marvel of beauty and loveliness and elegance and perfect grace; and as for the wooden horse, it was a miracle, never saw eyes aught goodlier than it nor more gracious than its make."" Asked the others, ""And what did the King with them?""; and the merchant answered, ""As for the man the King seized him and questioned him of the damsel and he pretended that she was his wife and the daughter of his paternal uncle; but she gave him the lie forthright and declared that he was a sorcerer and a villain. So the King took her from the old man and bade beat him and cast him into the trunk-house. As for the ebony horse, I know not what became of it."" When the Prince heard these words, he drew near to the merchant and began questioning him discreetly and courteously touching the name of the city and of its King; which when he knew, he passed the night full of joy. And as soon as dawned the day he set out and travelled sans surcease till he reached that city; but, when he would have entered, the gate-keepers laid hands on him, that they might bring him before the King to question him of his condition and the craft in which he was skilled and the cause of his coming thither-such being the usage and custom of their ruler. Now it was supper-time when he entered the city, and it was then impossible to go in to the King or take counsel with him respecting the stranger. So the guards carried him to the jail, thinking to lay him by the heels there for the night; but, when the warders saw his beauty and loveliness, they could not find it in their hearts to imprison him: they made him sit with them without the walls; and, when food came to them, he ate with them what sufficed him. As soon as they had made an end of eating, they turned to the Prince and said, ""What countryman art thou?"" ""I come from Fars,"" answered he, ""the land of the Chosroës."" When they heard this they laughed and one of them said, ""O Chosroan, I have heard the talk of men and their histories and I have looked into their conditions; but never saw I or heard I a bigger liar than the Chosroan which is with us in the jail."" Quoth another, ""And never did I see aught fouler than his favour or more hideous than his visnomy."" Asked the Prince. ""What have ye seen of his lying?""; and they answered, ""He pretendeth that he is one of the wise! Now the King came upon him, as he went a- hunting, and found with him a most beautiful woman and a horse of the blackest ebony, never saw I a handsomer. As for the damsel, she is with the King, who is enamoured of her and would fain marry her; but she is mad, and were this man a leach as he claimeth to be, he would have healed her, for the King doth his utmost to discover a cure for her case and a remedy for her disease, and this whole year past hath he spent treasure upon physicians and astrologers, on her account; but none can avail to cure her. As for the horse, it is in the royal hoard-house, and the ugly man is here with us in prison; and as soon as night falleth, he weepeth and bemoaneth himself and will not let us sleep.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Three Hundred and Sixty-ninth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the warders had recounted the case of the Persian egromancer they held in prison and his weeping and wailing, the Prince at once devised a device whereby he might compass his desire; and presently the guards of the gate, being minded to sleep, led him into the jail and locked the door. So he overheard the Persian weeping and bemoaning himself, in his own tongue, and saying, ""Alack, and alas for my sin, that I sinned against myself and against the King's son, in that which I did with the damsel; for I neither left her nor won my will of her! All this cometh of my lack of sense, in that I sought for myself that which I deserved not and which befitted not the like of me; for whoso seeketh what suiteth him not at all, falleth with the like of my fall."" Now when the King's son heard this, he accosted him in Persian, saying, ""How long will this weeping and wailing last? Say me, thinkest thou that hath befallen thee that which never befel other than thou?"" Now when the Persian heard this, he made friends with him and began to complain to him of his case and misfortunes. And as soon as the morning morrowed, the warders took the Prince and carried him before their King, informing him that he had entered the city on the previous night, at a time when audience was impossible. Quoth the King to the Prince, ""Whence comest thou and what is thy name and trade and why hast thou travelled hither?"" He replied, ""As to my name I am called in Persian Harjah; as to my country I come from the land of Fars; and I am of the men of art and especially of the art of medicine and healing the sick and those whom the Jinns drive mad. For this I go round about all countries and cities, to profit by adding knowledge to my knowledge, and whenever I see a patient I heal him and this is my craft."" Now when the King heard this, he rejoiced with exceeding joy and said, ""O excellent Sage, thou hast indeed come to us at a time when we need thee."" Then he acquainted him with the case of the Princess, adding, ""If thou cure her and recover her from her madness, thou shalt have of me everything thou seekest."" Replied the Prince, ""Allah save and favour the King: describe to me all thou hast seen of her insanity and tell me how long it is since the access attacked her; also how thou camest by her and the horse and the Sage."" So the King told him the whole story, from first to last, adding, ""The Sage is in goal."" Quoth the Prince, ""O auspicious King, and what hast thou done with the horse?"" Quoth the King, ""O youth, it is with me yet, laid up in one of my treasure-chambers,"" whereupon said the Prince within himself, ""The best thing I can do is first to see the horse and assure myself of its condition. If it be whole and sound, all will be well and end well; but, if its motor-works be destroyed, I must find some other way of delivering my beloved."" Thereupon he turned to the King and said to him, ""O King, I must see the horse in question: haply I may find in it somewhat that will serve me for the recovery of the damsel."" ""With all my heart,"" replied the King, and taking him by the hand, showed him into the place where the horse was. The Prince went round about it, examining its condition, and found it whole and sound, whereat he rejoiced greatly and said to the King, ""Allah save and exalt the King! I would fain go in to the damsel, that I may see how it is with her; for I hope in Allah to heal her by my healing hand through means of the horse."" Then he bade them take care of the horse and the King carried him to the Princess's apartment where her lover found her wringing her hands and writhing and beating herself against the ground, and tearing her garments to tatters as was her wont; but there was no madness of Jinn in her, and she did this but that none might approach her. When the Prince saw her thus, he said to her, ""No harm shall betide thee, O ravishment of the three worlds;"" and went on to soothe her and speak her fair, till he managed to whisper, ""I am Kamar al-Akmar;"" whereupon she cried out with a loud cry and fell down fainting for excess of joy; but the King thought this was epilepsy brought on by her fear of him, and by her suddenly being startled. Then the Prince put his mouth to her ear and said to her, ""O Shams al-Nahar, O seduction of the universe, have a care for thy life and mine and be patient and constant; for this our position needeth sufferance and skilful contrivance to make shift for our delivery from the tyrannical King. My first move will be now to go out to him and tell him that thou art possessed of a Jinn and hence thy madness; but that I will engage to heal thee and drive away the evil spirit, if he will at once unbind thy bonds. So when he cometh in to thee, do thou speak him smooth words, that he may think I have cured thee, and all will be done for us as we desire."" Quoth she, ""Hearkening and obedience;"" and he went out to the King in joy and gladness, and said to him, ""O august King, I have, by thy good fortune, discovered her disease and its remedy, and have cured her for thee. So now do thou go in to her and speak her softly and treat her kindly, and promise her what may please her; so shall all thou desirest of her be accomplished to thee.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Three Hundred and Seventieth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Prince feigned himself a leach and went in to the damsel and made himself known to her and told her how he purposed to deliver her, she cried ""Hearkening and obedience!"" He then fared forth from her and sought the King and said, ""Go thou in to her and speak her softly and promise her what may please her; so shall all thou desirest of her be accomplished to thee."" Thereupon the King went in to her and when she saw him, she rose and kissing the ground before him, bade him welcome and said, ""I admire how thou hast come to visit thy handmaid this day;"" whereat he was ready to fly for joy and bade the waiting-women and the eunuchs attend her and carry her to the Hammam and make ready for her dresses and adornment. So they went in to her and saluted her, and she returned their salams with the goodliest language and after the pleasantest fashion; whereupon they clad her in royal apparel and, clasping a collar of jewels about her neck, carried her to the bath and served her there. Then they brought her forth, as she were the full moon; and, when she came into the King's presence, she saluted him and kissed ground before him; whereupon he joyed in her with joy exceeding and said to the Prince, ""O Sage, O philosopher, all this is of thy blessing. Allah increase to us the benefit of thy healing breath!"" The Prince replied, ""O King, for the completion of her cure it behoveth that thou go forth, thou and all thy troops and guards, to the place where thou foundest her, not forgetting the beast of black wood which was with her; for therein is a devil; and, unless I exorcise him, he will return to her and afflict her at the head of every month."" ""With love and gladness,"" cried the King, ""O thou Prince of all philosophers and most learned of all who see the light of day."" Then he brought out the ebony horse to the meadow in question and rode thither with all his troops and the Princess, little weeting the purpose of the Prince. Now when they came to the appointed place, the Prince, still habited as a leach, bade them set the Princess and the steed as far as eye could reach from the King and his troops, and said to him, ""With thy leave, and at thy word, I will now proceed to the fumigations and conjurations, and here imprison the adversary of mankind, that he may never more return to her. After this, I shall mount this wooden horse which seemeth to be made of ebony, and take the damsel up behind me; whereupon it will shake and sway to and fro and fare forwards, till it come to thee, when the affair will be at an end; and after this thou mayst do with her as thou wilt."" When the King heard his words, he rejoiced with extreme joy; so the Prince mounted the horse and, taking the damsel up behind him, whilst the King and his troops watched him, bound her fast to him. Then he turned the ascending-pin and the horse took flight and soared with them high in air, till they disappeared from every eye. After this the King abode half the day, expecting their return; but they returned not. So when he despaired of them, repenting him greatly of that which he had done and grieving sore for the loss of the damsel, he went back to the city with his troops. He then sent for the Persian who was in prison and said to him, ""O thou traitor, O thou villian, why didst thou hide from me the mystery of the ebony horse? And now a sharper hath come to me and hath carried it off, together with a slave-girl whose ornaments are worth a mint of money, and I shall never see anyone or anything of them again!"" So the Persian related to him all his past, first and last, and the King was seized with a fit of fury which well-nigh ended his life. He shut himself up in his palace for a while, mourning and afflicted; but at last his Wazirs came in to him and applied themselves to comfort him, saying, ""Verily, he who took the damsel is an enchanter, and praised be Allah who hath delivered thee from his craft and sorcery!"" And they ceased not from him, till he was comforted for her loss. Thus far concerning the King; but as for the Prince, he continued his career towards his father's capital in joy and cheer, and stayed not till he alighted on his own palace, where he set the lady in safety; after which he went in to his father and mother and saluted them and acquainted them with her coming, whereat they were filled with solace and gladness. Then he spread great banquets for the towns-folk,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Three Hundred and Seventy-first Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the King's son spread great banquets for the towns-folk and they held high festival a whole month, at the end of which time he went in to the Princess and they took their joy of each other with exceeding joy. But his father brake the ebony horse in pieces and destroyed its mechanism for flight; moreover the Prince wrote a letter to the Princess's father, advising him of all that had befallen her and informing him how she was now married to him and in all health and happiness, and sent it by a messenger, together with costly presents and curious rarities. And when the messenger arrived at the city which was Sana'a and delivered the letter and the presents to the King, he read the missive and rejoiced greatly thereat and accepted the presents, honouring and rewarding the bearer handsomely. Moreover, he forwarded rich gifts to his son-in-law by the same messenger, who returned to his master and acquainted him with what had passed; whereat he was much cheered. And after this the Prince wrote a letter every year to his father-in-law and sent him presents till, in course of time, his sire King Sabur deceased and he reigned in his stead, ruling justly over his lieges and conducting himself well and righteously towards them, so that the land submitted to him and his subjects did him loyal service; and Kamar al-Akmar and his wife Shams al-Nahar abode in the enjoyment of all satisfaction and solace of life, till there came to them the Destroyer of deligights and Sunderer of societies; the Plunderer of palaces, the Caterer for cemeteries and the Garnerer of graves. And now glory be to the Living One who dieth not and in whose hand is the dominion of the worlds visible and invisible! Moreover I have heard tell the tale of

 Europe has degraded this autumnal festival, the Sun-fête Mihrgán (which balanced the vernal Nau-roz) into Michaelmas and its goose-massacre. It was so called because it began on the 16th of Mihr, the seventh month; and lasted six days, with feasts, festivities and great rejoicings in honour of the Sun, who now begins his southing-course to gladden the other half of the world.

 All Moslems, except those of the Máliki school, hold that the maker of an image representing anything of life will be commanded on the Judgment Day to animate it, and failing will be duly sent to the Fire. This severity arose apparently from the necessity of putting down idol-worship and, perhaps, for the same reason the Greek Church admits pictures but not statues. Of course the command has been honoured with extensive breaching: for instance all the Sultans of Stambul have had their portraits drawn and painted.

It is of two kinds, the red (Solanum lycopersicum) and the black (S. Melongena). The Spaniards know it as ""berengeria"" and when Sancho Panza (Part ii. chapt. 2) says, ""The Moors are fond of egg-plants"" he means more than appears. The vegetable is held to be exceedingly heating and thereby to breed melancholia and madness; hence one says to a man that has done something eccentric, ""Thou hast been eating brinjalls.""

 The Bul. Edit. as usual abridges (vol. i. 534). The Prince lands on the palace-roof where he leaves his horse, and finding no one in the building goes back to the terrace. Suddenly he sees a beautiful girl approaching him with a party of her women, suggesting to him these couplets,
""She came without tryst in the darkest hour, *
Like full moon lighting horizon's night:
Slim-formed, there is not in the world her like *
For grace of form or for gifts of sprite:
'Praise him who made her from semen-drop,' *
I cried, when her beauty first struck my sight:
I guard her from eyes, seeking refuge with *
The Lord of mankind and of morning-light.""

 The dearest ambition of a slave is not liberty but to have a slave of his own. This was systematised by the servile rulers known in history as the Mameluke Beys and to the Egyptians as the Ghuzz. Each had his household of servile pages and squires, who looked forward to filling the master's place as knight or baron.
 The well-known capital of Al-Yaman, a true Arabia Felix, a Paradise inhabited by demons in the shape of Turkish soldiery and Arab caterans. According to Moslem writers Sana'a was founded by Shem son of Noah who, wandering southward with his posterity after his father's death, and finding the site delightful, dug a well and founded the citadel, Ghamdán, which afterwards contained a Mason Carrée rivalling (or attempting to rival) the Meccan Ka'abah. The builder was Surahbíl who, says M.C. de Perceval coloured its four faces red, white, golden and green; the central quadrangle had seven stories (the planets) each forty cubits high, and the lowest was a marble hall ceiling'd with a single slab. At the four corners stood hollow lions through whose mouths the winds roared. This palatial citadel-temple was destroyed by order of Caliph Omar. The city's ancient name was Azal or Uzal whom some identify with one of the thirteen sons of Joktan (Genesis xi. 27): it took its present name from the Ethiopian conquerors (they say) who, seeing it for the first time, cried ""Hazá Sana'ah!"" meaning in their tongue, this is commodious, etc. I may note that the word is Kisawahili (Zanzibarian) e.g. ""Yámbo sáná—is the state good?"" Sana'a was the capital of the Tabábi'ah or Tobba Kings who judaized; and the Abyssinians with their Negush made it Christian while the Persians under Anushirwán converted it to Guebrism. It is now easily visited but to little purpose; excursions in the neighborhood being deadly dangerous. Moreover the Turkish garrison would probably murder a stranger who sympathised with the Arabs, and the Arabs kill one who took part with their hated and hateful conquerors. The late Mr. Shapira of Jerusalem declared that he had visited it and Jews have great advantages in such travel. But his friends doubted him.

 Easterns as a rule sleep with head and body covered by a sheet or in cold weather a blanket. The practice is doubtless hygienic, defending the body from draughts when the pores are open; but Europeans find it hard to adopt; it seems to stop their breathing. Another excellent practice in the East, and indeed amongst barbarians and savages generally, is training children to sleep with mouths shut: in after life they never snore and in malarious lands they do not require Outram's ""fever-guard,"" a swathe of muslin over the mouth. Mr. Catlin thought so highly of the ""shut mouth"" that he made it the subject of a book.

There was once in times of yore and ages long gone before, a great and puissant King, of the Kings of the Persians, Sábúr by name, who was the richest of all the Kings in store of wealth and dominion and surpassed each and every in wit and wisdom. He was generous, open handed and beneficent, and he gave to those who sought him and repelled not those who resorted to him; and he comforted the broken-hearted and honourably entreated those who fled to him for refuge. Moreover, he loved the poor and was hospitable to strangers and did the oppressed justice upon the oppressor. He had three daughters, like full moons of shining light or flower-gardens blooming bright; and a son as he were the moon; and it was his wont to keep two festivals in the twelve- month, those of the Nau-Roz, or New Year, and Mihrgán the Autumnal Equinox, on which occasions he threw open his palaces and gave largesse and made proclamation of safety and security and promoted his chamberlains and viceroys; and the people of his realm came in to him and saluted him and gave him joy of the holy day, bringing him gifts and servants and eunuchs. Now he loved science and geometry, and one festival-day as he sat on his kingly throne there came in to him three wise men, cunning artificers and past masters in all manner of craft and inventions, skilled in making things curious and rare, such as confound the wit; and versed in the knowledge of occult truths and perfect in mysteries and subtleties. And they were of three different tongues and countries, the first a Hindi or Indian, the second a Roumi or Greek and the third a Farsi or Persian. The Indian came forwards and, prostrating himself before the King, wished him joy of the festival and laid before him a present befitting his dignity; that is to say, a man of gold, set with precious gems and jewels of price and hending in hand a golden trumpet. When Sabur saw this, he asked, ""O sage, what is the virtue of this figure?""; and the Indian answered, ""O my lord, if this figure be set at the gate of thy city, it will be a guardian over it; for, in an enemy enter the place, it will blow this clarion against him and he will be seized with a palsy and drop down dead."" Much the King marvelled at this and cried, ""By Allah, O sage, an this thy word be true, I will grant thee thy wish and thy desire."" Then came forward the Greek and, prostrating himself before the King, presented him with a basin of silver, in whose midst was a peacock of gold, surrounded by four-and-twenty chicks of the same metal. Sabur looked at them and turning to the Greek, said to him, ""O sage, what is the virtue of this peacock?"" ""O my lord,"" answered he, ""as often as an hour of the day or night passeth, it pecketh one of its young and crieth out and flappeth its wings, till the four-and-twenty hours are accomplished; and when the month cometh to an end, it will open its mouth and thou shalt see the crescent therein."" And the King said, ""An thou speak sooth, I will bring thee to thy wish and thy desire."" Then came forward the Persian sage and, prostrating himself before the King, presented him with a horse of the blackest ebony-wood inlaid with gold and jewels, and ready harnessed with saddle, bridle and stirrups such as befit Kings; which when Sabur saw, he marvelled with exceeding marvel and was confounded at the beauty of its form and the ingenuity of its fashion. So he asked, ""What is the use of this horse of wood, and what is its virtue and what the secret of its movement?""; and the Persian answered, ""O my lord, the virtue of this horse is that, if one mount him, it will carry him whither he will and fare with its rider through the air and cover the space of a year in a single day."" The King marvelled and was amazed at these three wonders, following thus hard upon one another on the same day, and turning to the sage, said to him, ""By Allah the Omnipotent, and our Lord the Beneficent, who created all creatures and feedeth them with meat and drink, an thy speech be veritable and the virtue of thy contrivance appear, I will assuredly give thee whatsoever thou lustest for and will bring thee to thy desire and thy wish!"" Then he entertained the sages three days, that he might make trial of their gifts; after which they brought the figures before him and each took the creature he had wroughten and showed him the mystery of its movement. The trumpeter blew the trump; the peacock pecked its chicks and the Persian sage mounted the ebony house, whereupon it soared with him high in air and descended again. When King Sabur saw all this, he was amazed and perplexed and felt like to fly for joy and said to the three sages, ""Now I am certified of the truth of your words and it behoveth me to quit me of my promise. Ask ye, therefore, what ye will, and I will give you that same."" Now the report of the King's daughters had reached the sages, so they answered, ""If the King be content with us and accept of our gifts and allow us to prefer a request to him, we crave of him that he give us his three daughters in marriage, that we may be his sons-in-law; for that the stability of Kings may not be gainsaid."" Quoth the King, ""I grant you that which you wish and you desire,"" and bade summon the Kazi forthright, that he might marry each of the sages to one of his daughters. Now it fortuned that the Princesses were behind a curtain, looking on; and when they heard this, the youngest considered her husband to be and behold, he was an old man, an hundred years of age, with hair frosted, forehead drooping, eyebrows mangy, ears slitten, beard and mustachios stained and dyed; eyes red and goggle; cheeks bleached and hollow; flabby nose like a brinjall, or egg- plant; face like a cobbler's apron, teeth overlapping and lips like camel's kidneys, loose and pendulous; in brief a terror, a horror, a monster, for he was of the folk of his time the unsightliest and of his age the frightfullest; sundry of his grinders had been knocked out and his eye-teeth were like the tusks of the Jinni who frighteneth poultry in hen-houses. Now the girl was the fairest and most graceful of her time, more elegant than the gazelle however tender, than the gentlest zephyr blander and brighter than the moon at her full; for amorous fray right suitable; confounding in graceful sway the waving bough and outdoing in swimming gait the pacing roe; in fine she was fairer and sweeter by far than all her sisters. So, when she saw her suitor, she went to her chamber and strewed dust on her head and tore her clothes and fell to buffeting her face and weeping and wailing. Now the Prince, her brother, Kamar al-Akmár, or the Moon of Moons hight, was then newly returned from a journey and, hearing her weeping and crying came in to her (for he loved her with fond affection, more than his other sisters) and asked her, ""What aileth thee? What hath befallen thee? Tell me and conceal naught from me."" So she smote her breast and answered, ""O my brother and my dear one, I have nothing to hide. If the palace be straitened upon thy father, I will go out; and if he be resolved upon a foul thing, I will separate myself from him, though he consent not to make provision for me; and my Lord will provide."" Quoth he, ""Tell me what meaneth this talk and what hath straitened thy breast and troubled thy temper."" ""O my brother and my dear one,"" answered the Princess, ""Know that my father hath promised me in marriage to a wicked magician who brought him, as a gift, a horse of black wood, and hath bewitched him with his craft and his egromancy; but, as for me, I will none of him, and would, because of him, I had never come into this world!"" Her brother soothed her and solaced her, then fared to his sire and said, ""What be this wizard to whom thou hast given my youngest sister in marriage, and what is this present which he hath brought thee, so that thou hast killed my sister with chagrin? It is not right that this should be."" Now the Persian was standing by and, when he heard the Prince's words, he was mortified and filled with fury and the King said, ""O my son, an thou sawest this horse, thy wit would be confounded and thou wouldst be amated with amazement."" Then he bade the slaves bring the horse before him and they did so; and, when the Prince saw it, it pleased him. So (being an accomplished cavalier) he mounted it forthright and struck its sides with the shovel-shaped stirrup-irons; but it stirred not and the King said to the Sage, ""Go show him its movement, that he also may help thee to win thy wish."" Now the Persian bore the Prince a grudge because he willed not he should have his sister; so he showed him the pin of ascent on the right side of the horse and saying to him, ""Trill this,"" left him. Thereupon the Prince trilled the pin and lo! the horse forthwith soared with him high in ether, as it were a bird, and gave not overflying till it disappeared from men's espying, whereat the King was troubled and perplexed about his case and said to the Persian, ""O sage, look how thou mayest make him descend."" But he replied, ""O my lord, I can do nothing, and thou wilt never see him again till Resurrection-day, for he, of his ignorance and pride, asked me not of the pin of descent and I forgot to acquaint him therewith."" When the King heard this, he was enraged with sore rage; and bade bastinado the sorcerer and clap him in jail, whilst he himself cast the crown from his head and beat his face and smote his breast. Moreover, he shut the doors of his palaces and gave himself up to weeping and keening, he and his wife and daughters and all the folk of the city; and thus their joy was turned to annoy and their gladness changed into sore affliction and sadness. Thus far concerning them; but as regards the Prince, the horse gave not over soaring with him till he drew near the sun, whereat he gave himself up for lost and saw death in the skies, and was confounded at his case, repenting him of having mounted the horse and saying to himself, ""Verily, this was a device of the Sage to destroy me on account of my youngest sister; but there is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! I am lost without recourse; but I wonder, did not he who made the ascent-pin make also a descent-pin?"" Now he was a man of wit and knowledge and intelligence; so he fell to feeling all the parts of the horse, but saw nothing save a screw, like a cock's head, on its right shoulder and the like on the left, when quoth he to himself, ""I see no sign save these things like buttons."" Presently he turned the right-hand pin, whereupon the horse flew heavenwards with increased speed. So he left it and looking at the sinister shoulder and finding another pin, he wound it up and immediately the steed's upwards motion slowed and ceased and it began to descend, little by little, towards the face of the earth, while the rider became yet more cautious and careful of his life.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Three Hundred and Fifty-eighth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Prince wound up the sinister screw, the steed's upward motion slowed and ceased, and it began to descend, little by little, towards the earth while the rider became yet more cautious and careful of his life. And when he saw this and knew the uses of the horse, his heart was filled with joy and gladness and he thanked Almighty Allah for that He had deigned deliver him from destruction. Then he began to turn the horse's head whithersoever he would, making it rise and fall at pleasure, till he had gotten complete mastery over its every movement. He ceased not to descend the whole of that day, for that the steed's ascending flight had borne him afar from the earth; and, as he descended, he diverted himself with viewing the various cities and countries over which he passed and which he knew not, never having seen them in his life. Amongst the rest, he descried a city ordered after the fairest fashion in the midst of a verdant and riant land, rich in trees and streams, with gazelles pacing daintily over the plains; whereat he fell a-musing and said to himself, ""Would I knew the name of yon town and in what land it is!"" And he took to circling about it and observing it right and left. By this time, the day began to decline and the sun drew near to its downing; and he said in his mind, ""Verily I find no goodlier place to night in than this city; so I will lodge here and early on the morrow I will return to my kith and kin and my kingdom; and tell my father and family what hath passed and acquaint him with what mine eyes have seen."" Then he addressed himself to seeking a place wherein he might safely bestow himself and his horse and where none should descry him, and presently behold, he espied a-middlemost of the city a palace rising high in upper air surrounded by a great wall with lofty crenelles and battlements, guarded by forty black slaves, clad in complete mail and armed with spears and swords, bows and arrows. Quoth he, ""This is a goodly place,"" and turned the descent-pin, whereupon the horse sank down with him like a weary bird, and alighted gently on the terrace-roof of the palace. So the Prince dismounted and ejaculating ""Alhamdolillah""—praise be to Allah—he began to go round about the horse and examine it, saying, ""By Allah, he who fashioned thee with these perfections was a cunning craftsman, and if the Almighty extend the term of my life and restore me to my country and kinsfolk in safety and reunite me with my father, I will assuredly bestow upon him all manner bounties and benefit him with the utmost beneficence."" By this time night had overtaken him and he sat on the roof till he was assured that all in the palace slept; and indeed hunger and thirst were sore upon him, for that he had not tasted food nor drunk water since he parted from his sire. So he said within himself, ""Surely the like of this palace will not lack of victual;"" and, leaving the horse above, went down in search of somewhat to eat. Presently, he came to a staircase and descending it to the bottom, found himself in a court paved with white marble and alabaster, which shone in the light of the moon. He marvelled at the place and the goodliness of its fashion, but sensed no sound of speaker and saw no living soul and stood in perplexed surprise, looking right and left and knowing not whither he should wend. Then said he to himself, ""I may not do better than return to where I left my horse and pass the night by it; and as soon as day shall dawn I will mount and ride away.""— And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Three Hundred and Fifty-ninth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that quoth the king's son to himself, ""I may not do better than pass the night by my horse; and as soon as day shall dawn I will mount and ride away."" However, as he tarried talking to himself, he espied a light within the palace, and making towards it, found that it came from a candle that stood before a door of the Harim, at the head of a sleeping eunuch, as he were one of the Ifrits of Solomon or a tribesman of the Jinn, longer than lumber and broader than a bench. He lay before the door, with the pommel of his sword gleaming in the flame of the candle, and at his head was a bag of leather hanging from a column of granite. When the Prince saw this, he was affrighted and said, ""I crave help from Allah the Supreme! O mine Holy One, even as Thou hast already delivered me from destruction, so vouchsafe me strength to quit myself of the adventure of this palace!"" So saying, he put out his hand to the budget and taking it, carried it aside and opened it and found in it food of the best. He ate his fill and refreshed himself and drank water, after which he hung up the provision-bag in its place and drawing the eunuch's sword from its sheath, took it, whilst the slave slept on, knowing not whence destiny should come to him. Then the Prince fared forwards into the palace and ceased not till he came to a second door, with a curtain drawn before it; so he raised the curtain and behold, on entering he saw a couch of the whitest ivory, inlaid with pearls and jacinths and jewels, and four slave-girls sleeping about it. He went up to the couch, to see what was thereon, and found a young lady lying asleep, chemised with her hair as she were the full moon rising over the Eastern horizon, with flower-white brow and shining hair-paring and cheeks like blood-red anemones and dainty moles thereon. He was amazed at her as she lay in her beauty and loveliness, her symmetry and grace, and he recked no more of death. So he went up to her, trembling in every nerve and, shuddering with pleasure, kissed her on the right cheek; whereupon she awoke forthright and opened her eyes, and seeing the Prince standing at her head, said to him, ""Who art thou and whence comest thou?"" Quoth he, ""I am thy slave and thy lover."" Asked she, ""And who brought thee hither?"" and he answered, ""My Lord and my fortune."" Then said Shams al-Nahár (for such was her name), ""Haply thou art he who demanded me yesterday of my father in marriage and he rejected thee, pretending that thou wast foul of favour. By Allah, my sire lied in his throat when he spoke this thing, for thou art not other than beautiful."" Now the son of the King of Hind had sought her in marriage, but her father had rejected him, for that he was ugly and uncouth, and she thought the Prince was he. So, when she saw his beauty and grace (for indeed he was like the radiant moon) the syntheism of love gat hold of her heart as it were a flaming fire, and they fell to talk and converse. Suddenly, her waiting-women awoke and, seeing the Prince with their mistress, said to her, ""Oh my lady, who is this with thee?"" Quoth she, ""I know not; I found him sitting by me, when I woke up: haply 'tis he who seeketh me in marriage of my sire."" Quoth they, ""O my lady, by Allah the All-Father, this is not he who seeketh thee in marriage, for he is hideous and this man is handsome and of high degree. Indeed, the other is not fit to be his servant."" Then the handmaidens went out to the eunuch, and finding him slumbering awoke him, and he started up in alarm. Said they, ""How happeth it that thou art on guard at the palace and yet men come in to us, whilst we are asleep?"" When the black heard this, he sprang in haste to his sword, but found it not; and fear took him and trembling. Then he went in, confounded, to his mistress and seeing the Prince sitting at talk with her, said to him, ""O my lord, art thou man or Jinni?"" Replied the Prince, ""Woe to thee, O unluckiest of slaves: how darest thou even the sons of the royal Chosroes with one of the unbelieving Satans?"" And he was as a raging lion. Then he took the sword in his hand and said to the slave, ""I am the King's son-in-law, and he hath married me to his daughter and bidden me go in to her."" And when the eunuch heard these words he replied, ""O my lord, if thou be indeed of kind a man as thou avouchest, she is fit for none but for thee, and thou art worthier of her than any other."" Thereupon the eunuch ran to the King, shrieking loud and rending his raiment and heaving dust upon his head; and when the King heard his outcry, he said to him, ""What hath befallen thee?: speak quickly and be brief; for thou hast fluttered my heart."" Answered the eunuch, ""O King, come to thy daughter's succour; for a devil of the Jinn, in the likeness of a King's son, hath got possession of her; so up and at him!"" When the King heard this, he thought to kill him and said, ""How camest thou to be careless of my daughter and let this demon come at her?"" Then he betook himself to the Princess's palace, where he found her slave-women standing to await him and asked them, ""What is come to my daughter?"" ""O King,"" answered they, ""slumber overcame us and, when we awoke, we found a young man sitting upon her couch in talk with her, as he were the full moon; never saw we aught fairer of favour than he. So we questioned him of his case and he declared that thou hadst given him thy daughter in marriage. More than this we know not, nor do we know if he be a man or a Jinni; but he is modest and well bred, and doth nothing unseemly or which leadeth to disgrace."" Now when the King heard these words, his wrath cooled and he raised the curtain little by little and looking in, saw sitting at talk with his daughter a Prince of the goodliest with a face like the full moon for sheen. At this sight he could not contain himself, of his jealousy for his daughter's honour; and, putting aside the curtain, rushed in upon them drawn sword in hand like a furious Ghul. Now when the Prince saw him he asked the Princess, ""Is this thy sire?""; and she answered, ""Yes.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Three Hundred and Sixtieth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Price saw the King rushing in upon them, drawn sword in hand, like a furious Ghul he asked the Princess, ""Is this thy sire?""; and she answered, ""Yes."" Whereupon he sprang to his feet and, seizing his sword, cried out at the King with so terrible a cry that he was confounded. Then the youth would have fallen on him with the sword; but the King seeing that the Prince was doughtier than he, sheathed his scymitar and stood till the young man came up to him, when he accosted him courteously and said to him, ""O youth, art thou a man or a Jinni?"" Quoth the Prince, ""Did I not respect thy right as mine host and thy daughter's honour, I would spill thy blood! How darest thou fellow me with devils, me that am a Prince of the sons of the royal Chosroes who, had they wished to take thy kingdom, could shake thee like an earthquake from thy glory and thy dominions and spoil thee of all thy possessions?"" Now when the King heard his words, he was confounded with awe and bodily fear of him and rejoined, ""If thou indeed be of the sons of the Kings, as thou pretendest, how cometh it that thou enterest my palace without my permission, and smirchest mine honour, making thy way to my daughter and feigning that thou art her husband and claiming that I have given her to thee to wife, I that have slain Kings and Kings' sons, who sought her of me in marriage? And now who shall save thee from my might and majesty when, if I cried out to my slaves and servants and bade them put thee to the vilest of deaths they would slay thee forthright? Who shall deliver thee out of my hand?"" When the Prince heard this speech of the King he answered, ""Verily, I wonder at thee and at the shortness and denseness of thy wit! Say me, canst covet for thy daughter a mate comelier than myself, and hast ever seen a stouter hearted man or one better fitted for a Sultan or a more glorious in rank and dominion than I?"" Rejoined the King, ""Nay, by Allah! but I would have had thee, O youth, act after the custom of Kings and demand her from me to wife before witnesses, that I might have married her to thee publicly; and now, even were I to marry her to thee privily, yet hast thou dishonoured me in her person."" Rejoined the Prince, ""Thou sayest sooth, O King, but if thou summon thy slaves and thy soldiers and they fall upon me and slay me, as thou pretendest, thou wouldst but publish thine own disgrace, and the folk would be divided between belief in thee and disbelief in thee. Wherefore, O King, thou wilt do well, meseemeth, to turn from this thought to that which I shall counsel thee."" Quoth the King, ""Let me hear what thou hast to advise;"" and quoth the Prince, ""What I have to propose to thee is this: either do thou meet me in combat singular, I and thou; and he who slayeth his adversary shall be held the worthier and having a better title to the kingdom; or else, let me be this night and, whenas dawns the morn, draw out against me thy horsemen and footmen and servants; but first tell me their number."" Said the King, ""They are forty thousand horse, beside my own slaves and their followers, who are the like of them in number."" Thereupon said the Prince, ""When the day shall break, do thou array them against me and say to them""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Three Hundred and Sixty-first Night,
She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that quoth the Prince, ""When day shall break, do thou array them against me and say to them: 'This man is a suitor to me for my daughter's hand, on condition that he shall do battle single-handed against you all; for he pretendeth that he will overcome you and put you to the rout, and indeed that ye cannot prevail against him.' After which, leave me to do battle with them: if they slay me, then is thy secret surer guarded and thine honour the better warded; and if I overcome them and see their backs, then is it the like of me a King should covet to his son-in-law."" So the King approved of his opinion and accepted his proposition, despite his awe at the boldness of his speech and amaze at the pretensions of the Prince to meet in fight his whole host, such as he had described to him, being at heart assured that he would perish in the fray and so he should be quit of him and freed from the fear of dishonour. Thereupon he called the eunuch and bade him go to his Wazir without stay and delay and command him to assemble the whole of the army and cause them don their arms and armour and mount their steeds. So the eunuch carried the King's order to the Minister, who straightaway summoned the Captains of the host and the Lords of the realm and bade them don their harness of derring-do and mount horse and sally forth in battle array. Such was their case; but as regards the King, he sat a long while conversing with the young Prince, being pleased with his wise speech and good sense and fine breeding. And when it was day-break he returned to his palace and, seating himself on his throne, commanded his merry men to mount and bade them saddle one of the best of the royal steeds with handsome selle and housings and trappings and bring it to the Prince. But the youth said, ""O King, I will not mount horse, till I come in view of the troops and review them."" ""Be it as thou wilt,"" replied the King. Then the two repaired to the parade-ground, where the troops were drawn up, and the young Prince looked upon them and noted their great number; after which the King cried out to them, saying, ""Ho, all ye men, there is come to me a youth who seeketh my daughter in marriage; and in very sooth never have I seen a goodlier than he; no, nor a stouter of heart nor a doughtier of arm, for he pretendeth that he can overcome you, single-handed, and force you to flight and that, were ye an hundred thousand in number, yet for him would ye be but few. Now when he chargeth down on you, do ye receive him upon point of pike and sharp of sabre; for, indeed, he hath undertaken a mighty matter."" Then quoth the King to the Prince, ""Up, O my son, and do thy devoir on them."" Answered he, ""O King, thou dealest not justly and fairly by me: how shall I go forth against them, seeing that I am afoot and the men be mounted?"" The King retorted, ""I bade thee mount, and thou refusedst; but choose thou which of my horses thou wilt."" Then he said, ""Not one of thy horses pleaseth me, and I will ride none but that on which I came."" Asked the King, ""And where is thy horse?"" ""Atop of thy palace."" ""In what part of my palace?"" ""On the roof."" Now when the King heard these words, he cried, ""Out on thee! this is the first sign thou hast given of madness. How can the horse be on the roof? But we shall at once see if thou speak the truth or lies."" Then he turned to one of his chief officers and said to him, ""Go to my palace and bring me what thou findest on the roof."" So all the people marvelled at the young Prince's words, saying one to other, ""How can a horse come down the steps from the roof? Verily this is a thing whose like we never heard."" In the meantime the King's messenger repaired to the palace and mounting to the roof, found the horse standing there and never had he looked on a handsomer; but when he drew near and examined it, he saw that it was made of ebony and ivory. Now the officer was accompanied by other high officers, who also looked on and they laughed to one another, saying, ""Was it of the like of this horse that the youth spake? We cannot deem him other than mad; however, we shall soon see the truth of his case.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Three Hundred and Sixty-second Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the high officials looked upon the horse, they laughed one to other and said, ""Was it of the like of his horse that the youth spake? We cannot deem him other than mad; however, we shall soon see the truth of his case. Peradventure herein is some mighty matter, and he is a man of high degree."" Then they lifted up the horse bodily and, carrying it to the King, set it down before him, and all the lieges flocked round to look at it, marvelling at the beauty of its proportions and the richness of its saddle and bridle. The King also admired it and wondered at it with extreme wonder; and he asked the Prince, ""O youth, is this thy horse?"" He answered, ""Yes, O King, this is my horse, and thou shalt soon see the marvel it showeth."" Rejoined the King, ""Then take and mount it,"" and the Prince retorted, ""I will not mount till the troops withdraw afar from it."" So the King bade them retire a bowshot from the horse; whereupon quoth its owner, ""O King, see thou; I am about to mount my horse and charge upon thy host and scatter them right and left and split their hearts asunder."" Said the King, ""Do as thou wilt; and spare not their lives, for they will not spare thine."" Then the Prince mounted, whilst the troops ranged themselves in ranks before him, and one said to another, ""When the youth cometh between the ranks, we will take him on the points of our pikes and the sharps of our sabres."" Quoth another, ""By Allah, this a mere misfortune: how shall we slay a youth so comely of face and shapely of form?"" And a third continued, ""Ye will have hard work to get the better of him; for the youth had not done this, but for what he knew of his own prowess and pre- eminence of valour."" Meanwhile, having settled himself in his saddle, the Prince turned the pin of ascent; whilst all eyes were strained to see what he would do, whereupon the horse began to heave and rock and sway to and fro and make the strangest of movements steed ever made, till its belly was filled with air and it took flight with its rider and soared high into the sky. When the King saw this, he cried out to his men, saying, ""Woe to you! catch him, catch him, ere he 'scape you!"" But his Wazirs and Viceroys said to him, ""O King, can a man overtake the flying bird? This is surely none but some mighty magician or Marid of the Jinn or devil, and Allah save thee from him. So praise thou the Almighty for deliverance of thee and of all thy host from his hand."" Then the King returned to his palace after seeing the feat of the Prince and, going in to his daughter, acquainted her with what had befallen them both on the parade-ground. He found her grievously afflicted for the Prince and bewailing her separation from him; wherefore she fell sick with violent sickness and took to her pillow. Now when her father saw her on this wise, he pressed her to his breast and kissing her between the eyes, said to her, ""O my daughter, praise Allah Almighty and thank Him for that He hath delivered us from this crafty enchanter, this villain, this low fellow, this thief who thought only of seducing thee!"" And he repeated to her the story of the Prince and how he had disappeared in the firmament; and he abused him and cursed him knowing not how dearly his daughter loved him. But she paid no heed to his words and did but redouble in her tears and wails, saying to herself, ""By Allah, I will neither eat meat nor drain drink, till Allah reunite me with him!"" Her father was greatly concerned for her case and mourned much over her plight; but, for all he could do to soother her, love-longing only increased on her.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Three Hundred and Sixty-third Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the King mourned much over his daughter's plight but, for all he could do to soothe her, love-longing only increased on her. Thus far concerning the King and Princess Shams al-Nahár; but as regards Prince Kamar al-Akmar, when he had risen high in air, he turned his horse's head towards his native land, and being alone mused upon the beauty of the Princess and her loveliness. Now he had enquired of the King's people the name of the city and of its King and his daughter; and men had told him that it was the city of Sana'á. So he journeyed with all speed, till he drew near his father's capital and, making an airy circuit about the city, alighted on the roof of the King's palace, where he left his horse, whilst he descended into the palace and seeing its threshold strewn with ashes, though that one of his family was dead. Then he entered, as of wont, and found his father and mother and sisters clad in mourning raiment of black, all pale of faces and lean of frames. When his sire descried him and was assured that it was indeed his son, he cried out with a great cry and fell down in a fit, but after a time coming to himself, threw himself upon him and embraced him, clipping him to his bosom and rejoicing in him with exceeding joy and extreme gladness. His mother and sisters heard this; so they came in and seeing the Prince, fell upon him, kissing him and weeping, and joying with exceeding joyance. Then they questioned him of his case; so he told them all that had passed from first to last, and his father said to him, ""Praised be Allah for thy safety, O coolth of my eyes and core of my heart!"" Then the King bade hold high festival, and the glad tidings flew through the city. So they beat drums and cymbals and, doffing the weed of mourning, they donned the gay garb of gladness and decorated the streets and markets; whilst the folk vied with one another who should be the first to give the King joy, and the King proclaimed a general pardon and opening the prisons, released those who were therein prisoned. Moreover, he made banquets for the people, with great abundance of eating and drinking, for seven days and nights and all creatures were gladsomest; and he took horse with his son and rode out with him, that the folk might see him and rejoice. After awhile the Prince asked about the maker of the horse, saying, ""O my father, what hath fortune done with him?""; and the King answered, ""Allah never bless him nor the hour wherein I set eyes on him! For he was the cause of thy separation from us, O my son, and he hath lain in gaol since the day of thy disappearance."" Then the King bade release him from prison and, sending for him, invested him in a dress of satisfaction and entreated him with the utmost favour and munificence, save that he would not give him his daughter to wife; whereat the Sage raged with sore rage and repented of that which he had done, knowing that the Prince had secured the secret of the steed and the manner of its motion. Moreover, the King said to his son, ""I reck thou wilt do will not to go near the horse henceforth and more especially not to mount it after this day; for thou knowest not its properties, and belike thou art in error about it."" Not the Prince had told his father of his adventure with the King of Sana'a and his daughter and he said, ""Had the King intended to kill thee, he had done so; but thine hour was not yet come."" When the rejoicings were at an end, the people returned to their places and the King and his son to the palace, where they sat down and fell to eating and drinking and making merry. Now the King had a handsome handmaiden who was skilled in playing the lute; so she took it and began to sweep the strings and sing thereto before the King and his son of separation of lovers, and she chanted the following verses:—
""Deem not that absence breeds in me aught of forgetfulness; *
       &nbsp     What should remember I did you fro' my remembrance wane?
Time dies but never dies the fondest love for you we bear; *
       &nbsp     And in your love I'll die and in your love I'll arise
       &nbsp     again.""
When the Prince heard these verses, the fires of longing flamed up in his heart and pine and passion redoubled upon him. Grief and regret were sore upon him and his bowels yearned in him for love of the King's daughter of Sana'a; so he rose forthright and, escaping his father's notice, went forth the palace to the horse and mounting it, turned the pin of ascent, whereupon bird-like it flew with him high in air and soared towards the upper regions of the sky. In early morning his father missed him and, going up to the pinnacle of the palace, in great concern, saw his son rising into the firmament; whereat he was sore afflicted and repented in all penitence that he had not taken the horse and hidden it; and he said to himself, ""By Allah, if but my son return to me, I will destroy the horse, that my heart may be at rest concerning my son."" And he fell again to weeping and bewailing himself.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Three Hundred and Sixty-fourth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the King again fell to weeping and bewailing himself for his son. Such was his case; but as regards the Prince, he ceased not flying on through air till he came to the city of Sana'a and alighted on the roof as before. Then he crept down stealthily and, finding the eunuch asleep, as of wont, raised the curtain and went on little by little, till he came to the door of the Princess's alcove-chamber and stopped to listen; when lo! he heard her shedding plenteous tears and reciting verses, whilst her women slept round her. Presently, overhearing her weeping and wailing quoth they, ""O our mistress, why wilt thou mourn for one who mourneth not for thee?"" Quoth she, ""O ye little of wit, is he for whom I mourn of those who forget or who are forgotten?"" And she fell again to wailing and weeping, till sleep overcame her. Hereat the Prince's heart melted for her and his gall-bladder was like to burst, so he entered and, seeing her lying asleep without covering, touched her with his hand; whereupon she opened her eyes and espied him standing by her. Said he, ""Why all this crying and mourning?"" And when she knew him, she threw herself upon him, and took him around the neck and kissed him and answered, ""For thy sake and because of my separation from thee."" Said he, ""O my lady, I have been made desolate by thee all this long time!"" But she replied, ""'Tis thou who hast desolated me; and hadst thou tarried longer, I had surely died!"" Rejoined he, ""O my lady, what thinkest thou of my case with thy father and how he dealt with me? Were it not for my love of thee, O temptation and seduction of the Three Worlds, I had certainly slain him and made him a warning to all beholders; but, even as I love thee, so I love him for thy sake."" Quoth she, ""How couldst thou leave me: can my life be sweet to me after thee?"" Quoth he, ""Let what hath happened suffice: I am now hungry, and thirsty."" So she bade her maidens make ready meat and drink, and they sat eating and drinking and conversing till night was well nigh ended; and when day broke he rose to take leave of her and depart, ere the eunuch should awake. Shams al-Nahar asked him, ""Whither goest thou?""; and he answered, ""To my father's house, and I plight thee my troth that I will come to thee once in every week."" But she wept and said, ""I conjure thee, by Allah the Almighty, take me with thee whereso thou wendest and make me not taste anew the bittergourd of separation from thee."" Quoth he, ""Wilt thou indeed go with me?"" and quoth she, ""Yes."" ""Then,"" said he, ""arise that we depart."" So she rose forthright and going to a chest, arrayed herself in what was richest and dearest to her of her trinkets of gold and jewels of price, and she fared forth, her handmaids recking naught. So he carried her up to the roof of the palace and, mounting the ebony horse, took her up behind him and made her fast to himself, binding her with strong bonds; after which he turned the shoulder-pin of ascent, and the horse rose with him high in air. When her slave-women saw this, they shrieked aloud and told her father and mother, who in hot haste ran to the palace-roof and looking up, saw the magical horse flying away with the Prince and Princess. At this the King was troubled with ever-increasing trouble and cried out, saying, ""O King's son, I conjure thee, by Allah, have ruth on me and my wife and bereave us not of our daughter!"" The Prince made him no reply; but, thinking in himself that the maiden repented of leaving father and mother, asked her, ""O ravishment of the age, say me, wilt thou that I restore thee to thy mother and father?"": whereupon she answered, ""By Allah, O my lord, that is not my desire: my only wish is to be with thee, wherever thou art; for I am distracted by the love of thee from all else, even from my father and mother."" Hearing these words the Prince joyed with great joy, and made the horse fly and fare softly with them, so as not to disquiet her; nor did they stay their flight till they came in sight of a green meadow, wherein was a spring of running water. Here they alighted and ate and drank; after which the Prince took horse again and set her behind him, binding her in his fear for her safety; after which they fared on till they came in sight of his father's capital. At this, the Prince was filled with joy and bethought himself to show his beloved the seat of his dominion and his father's power and dignity and give her to know that it was greater than that of her sire. So he set her down in one of his father's gardens without the city where his parent was wont to take his pleasure; and, carrying her into a domed summer-house prepared there for the King, left the ebony horse at the door and charged the damsel keep watch over it, saying, ""Sit here, till my messenger come to thee; for I go now to my father, to make ready a palace for thee and show thee my royal estate."" She was delighted when she heard these words and said to him, ""Do as thou wilt;""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Three Hundred and Sixty-fifth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the maiden was delighted when she heard these words and said to him, ""Do as thou wilt;"" for she thereby understood that she should not enter the city but with due honour and worship, as became her rank. Then the Prince left her and betook himself to the palace of the King his father, who rejoiced in his return and met him and welcomed him; and the Prince said to him, ""Know that I have brought with me the King's daughter of whom I told thee; and have left her without the city in such a garden and come to tell thee, that thou mayst make ready the procession of estate and go forth to meet her and show her thy royal dignity and troops and guards."" Answered the King, ""With joy and gladness""; and straightaway bade decorate the town with the goodliest adornment. Then he took horse and rode out in all magnificence and majesty, he and his host, high officers and household, with drums and kettle-drums, fifes and clarions and all manner instruments; whilst the Prince drew forth of his treasuries jewellery and apparel and what else of the things which Kings hoards and made a rare display of wealth and splendour: moreover he got ready for the Princess a canopied litter of brocades, green, red and yellow, wherein he set Indian and Greek and Abyssinian slave- girls. Then he left the litter and those who were therein and preceded them to the pavilion where he had set her down; and searched but found naught, neither Princess nor horse. When he saw this, he beat his face, and rent his raiment and began to wander round about the garden, as he had lost his wits; after which he came to his senses and said to himself, ""How could she have come at the secret of this horse, seeing I told her nothing of it? Maybe the Persian sage who made the horse hath chanced upon her and stolen her away, in revenge for my father's treatment of him."" Then he sought the guardians of the garden and asked them if they had seen any pass the precincts; and said, ""Hath any one come in here? Tell me the truth and the whole truth or I will at once strike off your heads."" They were terrified by his threats; but they answered with one voice, ""We have seen no man enter save the Persian sage, who came to gather healing herbs."" So the Prince was certified that it was indeed he that had taken away the maiden,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Three Hundred and Sixty-sixth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Prince heard their answer, he was certified that the Sage had taken away the maiden and abode confounded and perplexed concerning his case. And he was abashed before the folk and, turning to his sire, told him what had happened and said to him, ""Take the troops and march them back to the city. As for me, I will never return till I have cleared up this affair."" When the King heard this, he wept and beat his breast and said to him, ""O my son, calm thy choler and master thy chagrin and come home with us and look what King's daughter thou wouldst fain have, that I may marry thee to her."" But the Prince paid no heed to his words and farewelling him departed, whilst the King returned to the city and their joy was changed into sore annoy. Now, as Destiny issued her decree, when the Prince left the Princess in the garden-house and betook himself to his father's palace, for the ordering of his affair, the Persian entered the garden to pluck certain simples and, scenting the sweet savour of musk and perfumes that exhaled from the Princess and impregnated the whole place, followed it till he came to the pavilion and saw standing at the door the horse which he had made with his own hands. His heart was filled with joy and gladness, for he had bemourned its loss much since it had gone out of his hand: so he went up to it and, examining its every part, found it whole and sound; whereupon he was about to mount and ride away, when he bethought himself and said, ""Needs must I first look what the Prince hath brought and left here with the horse."" So he entered the pavilion and, seeing the Princess sitting there, as she were the sun shining sheen in the sky serene, knew her at the first glance to be some high-born lady and doubted not but the Prince had brought her thither on the horse and left her in the pavilion, whilst he went to the city, to make ready for her entry in state procession with all splendor. Then he went up to her and kissed the earth between her hands, whereupon she raised her eyes to him and, finding him exceedingly foul of face and favour, asked, ""Who art thou?""; and he answered, ""O my lady, I am a messenger sent by the Prince who hath bidden me bring thee to another pleasance nearer the city; for that my lady the Queen cannot walk so far and is unwilling, of her joy in thee, that another should forestall her with thee."" Quoth she, ""Where is the Prince?""; and quoth the Persian, ""He is in the city, with his sire and forthwith he shall come for thee in great state."" Said she, ""O thou! say me, could he find none handsomer to send to me?""; whereat loud laughed the Sage and said, ""Yea verily, he hath not a Mameluke as ugly as I am; but, O my lady, let not the ill-favour of my face and the foulness of my form deceive thee. Hadst thou profited of me as hath the Prince, verily thou wouldst praise my affair. Indeed, he chose me as his messenger to thee, because of my uncomeliness and loathsomeness in his jealous love of thee; else hath he Mamelukes and negro slaves, pages, eunuchs and attendants out of number, each goodlier than other."" Whenas she heard this, it commended itself to her reason and she believed him; so she rose forthright;—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Three Hundred and Sixty-seventh Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Persian sage acquainted the Princess with the case of the King's son, she believed him; so she rose forthright; and, putting her hand in his, said, ""O my father, what hast thou brought me to ride?"" He replied, ""O my lady, thou shalt ride the horse thou camest on;"" and she, ""I cannot ride it by myself."" Whereupon he smiled and knew that he was her master and said, ""I will ride with thee myself."" So he mounted and, taking her up behind him bound her to himself with firm bonds, while she knew not what he would with her. Then he turned the ascent-pin, whereupon the belly of the horse became full of wind and it swayed to and fro like a wave of the sea, and rose with them high in air nor slackened in its flight, till it was out of sight of the city. Now when Shams al-Nahir saw this, she asked him, ""Ho thou! what is become of that thou toldest me of my Prince, making me believe that he sent thee to me?"" Answered the Persian, ""Allah damn the Prince! he is a mean and skin-flint knave."" She cried, ""Woe to thee! How darest thou disobey thy lord's commandment?"" Whereto the Persian replied, ""He is no lord of mine: knowest thou who I am?"" Rejoined the Princess, ""I know nothing of thee save what thou toldest me;"" and retorted he, ""What I told thee was a trick of mine against thee and the King's son: I have long lamented the loss of this horse which is under us; for I constructed it and made myself master of it. But now I have gotten firm hold of it and of thee too, and I will burn his heart even as he hath burnt mine; nor shall he ever have the horse again; no, never! So be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear; for I can be of more use to thee than he; and I am generous as I am wealthy; my servants and slaves shall obey thee as their mistress; I will robe thee in finest raiment and thine every wish shall be at thy will."" When she heard this, she buffeted her face and cried out, saying, ""Ah, well-away! I have not won my beloved and I have lost my father and mother!"" And she wept bitter tears over what had befallen her, whilst the Sage fared on with her, without ceasing, till he came to the land of the Greeks and alighted in a verdant mead, abounding in streams and trees. Now this meadow lay near a city wherein was a King of high puissance, and it chanced that he went forth that day to hunt and divert himself. As he passed by the meadow, he saw the Persian standing there, with the damsel and the horse by his side; and, before the Sage was ware, the King's slaves fell upon him and carried him and the lady and the horse to their master who, noting the foulness of the man's favour and his loathsomeness and the beauty of the girl and her loveliness, said, ""O my lady, what kin is this oldster to thee?"" The Persian made haste to reply, saying, ""She is my wife and the daughter of my father's brother."" But the lady at once gave him the lie and said, ""O King, by Allah, I know him not, nor is he my husband; nay, he is a wicked magician who hath stolen me away by force and fraud."" Thereupon the King bade bastinado the Persian and they beat him till he was well-nigh dead; after which the King commanded to carry him to the city and cast him into jail; and, taking from him the damsel and the ebony horse (though he knew not its properties nor the secret of its motion), set the girl in his serraglio and the horse amongst his hoards. Such was the case with the Sage and the lady; but as regards Prince Kamar al-Akmar, he garbed himself in travelling gear and taking what he needed of money, set out tracking their trail in very sorry plight; and journeyed from country to country and city to city seeking the Princess and enquiring after the ebony horse, whilst all who heard him marvelled at him and deemed his talk extravagant. Thus he continued doing a long while; but, for all his enquiry and quest, he could hit on no new news of her. At last he came to her father's city of Sana'a and there asked for her, but could get no tidings of her and found her father mourning her loss. So he turned back and made for the land of the Greeks, continuing to enquire concerning the twain as he went,— And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Three Hundred and Sixty-eighth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the King's son made for the land of the Greeks, continuing to enquire concerning the two as he went along, till, as chance would have it, he alighted at a certain Khan and saw a company of merchants sitting at talk. So he sat down near them and heard one say, ""O my friends, I lately witnessed a wonder of wonders."" They asked, ""What was that?"" and he answered, ""I was visiting such a district in such a city (naming the city wherein was the Princess), and I heard its people chatting of a strange thing which had lately befallen. It was that their King went out one day hunting and coursing with a company of his courtiers and the lords of his realm; and, issuing from the city, they came to a green meadow where they espied an old man standing, with a woman sitting hard by a horse of ebony. The man was foulest-foul of face and loathly of form, but the woman was a marvel of beauty and loveliness and elegance and perfect grace; and as for the wooden horse, it was a miracle, never saw eyes aught goodlier than it nor more gracious than its make."" Asked the others, ""And what did the King with them?""; and the merchant answered, ""As for the man the King seized him and questioned him of the damsel and he pretended that she was his wife and the daughter of his paternal uncle; but she gave him the lie forthright and declared that he was a sorcerer and a villain. So the King took her from the old man and bade beat him and cast him into the trunk-house. As for the ebony horse, I know not what became of it."" When the Prince heard these words, he drew near to the merchant and began questioning him discreetly and courteously touching the name of the city and of its King; which when he knew, he passed the night full of joy. And as soon as dawned the day he set out and travelled sans surcease till he reached that city; but, when he would have entered, the gate-keepers laid hands on him, that they might bring him before the King to question him of his condition and the craft in which he was skilled and the cause of his coming thither-such being the usage and custom of their ruler. Now it was supper-time when he entered the city, and it was then impossible to go in to the King or take counsel with him respecting the stranger. So the guards carried him to the jail, thinking to lay him by the heels there for the night; but, when the warders saw his beauty and loveliness, they could not find it in their hearts to imprison him: they made him sit with them without the walls; and, when food came to them, he ate with them what sufficed him. As soon as they had made an end of eating, they turned to the Prince and said, ""What countryman art thou?"" ""I come from Fars,"" answered he, ""the land of the Chosroës."" When they heard this they laughed and one of them said, ""O Chosroan, I have heard the talk of men and their histories and I have looked into their conditions; but never saw I or heard I a bigger liar than the Chosroan which is with us in the jail."" Quoth another, ""And never did I see aught fouler than his favour or more hideous than his visnomy."" Asked the Prince. ""What have ye seen of his lying?""; and they answered, ""He pretendeth that he is one of the wise! Now the King came upon him, as he went a- hunting, and found with him a most beautiful woman and a horse of the blackest ebony, never saw I a handsomer. As for the damsel, she is with the King, who is enamoured of her and would fain marry her; but she is mad, and were this man a leach as he claimeth to be, he would have healed her, for the King doth his utmost to discover a cure for her case and a remedy for her disease, and this whole year past hath he spent treasure upon physicians and astrologers, on her account; but none can avail to cure her. As for the horse, it is in the royal hoard-house, and the ugly man is here with us in prison; and as soon as night falleth, he weepeth and bemoaneth himself and will not let us sleep.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Three Hundred and Sixty-ninth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the warders had recounted the case of the Persian egromancer they held in prison and his weeping and wailing, the Prince at once devised a device whereby he might compass his desire; and presently the guards of the gate, being minded to sleep, led him into the jail and locked the door. So he overheard the Persian weeping and bemoaning himself, in his own tongue, and saying, ""Alack, and alas for my sin, that I sinned against myself and against the King's son, in that which I did with the damsel; for I neither left her nor won my will of her! All this cometh of my lack of sense, in that I sought for myself that which I deserved not and which befitted not the like of me; for whoso seeketh what suiteth him not at all, falleth with the like of my fall."" Now when the King's son heard this, he accosted him in Persian, saying, ""How long will this weeping and wailing last? Say me, thinkest thou that hath befallen thee that which never befel other than thou?"" Now when the Persian heard this, he made friends with him and began to complain to him of his case and misfortunes. And as soon as the morning morrowed, the warders took the Prince and carried him before their King, informing him that he had entered the city on the previous night, at a time when audience was impossible. Quoth the King to the Prince, ""Whence comest thou and what is thy name and trade and why hast thou travelled hither?"" He replied, ""As to my name I am called in Persian Harjah; as to my country I come from the land of Fars; and I am of the men of art and especially of the art of medicine and healing the sick and those whom the Jinns drive mad. For this I go round about all countries and cities, to profit by adding knowledge to my knowledge, and whenever I see a patient I heal him and this is my craft."" Now when the King heard this, he rejoiced with exceeding joy and said, ""O excellent Sage, thou hast indeed come to us at a time when we need thee."" Then he acquainted him with the case of the Princess, adding, ""If thou cure her and recover her from her madness, thou shalt have of me everything thou seekest."" Replied the Prince, ""Allah save and favour the King: describe to me all thou hast seen of her insanity and tell me how long it is since the access attacked her; also how thou camest by her and the horse and the Sage."" So the King told him the whole story, from first to last, adding, ""The Sage is in goal."" Quoth the Prince, ""O auspicious King, and what hast thou done with the horse?"" Quoth the King, ""O youth, it is with me yet, laid up in one of my treasure-chambers,"" whereupon said the Prince within himself, ""The best thing I can do is first to see the horse and assure myself of its condition. If it be whole and sound, all will be well and end well; but, if its motor-works be destroyed, I must find some other way of delivering my beloved."" Thereupon he turned to the King and said to him, ""O King, I must see the horse in question: haply I may find in it somewhat that will serve me for the recovery of the damsel."" ""With all my heart,"" replied the King, and taking him by the hand, showed him into the place where the horse was. The Prince went round about it, examining its condition, and found it whole and sound, whereat he rejoiced greatly and said to the King, ""Allah save and exalt the King! I would fain go in to the damsel, that I may see how it is with her; for I hope in Allah to heal her by my healing hand through means of the horse."" Then he bade them take care of the horse and the King carried him to the Princess's apartment where her lover found her wringing her hands and writhing and beating herself against the ground, and tearing her garments to tatters as was her wont; but there was no madness of Jinn in her, and she did this but that none might approach her. When the Prince saw her thus, he said to her, ""No harm shall betide thee, O ravishment of the three worlds;"" and went on to soothe her and speak her fair, till he managed to whisper, ""I am Kamar al-Akmar;"" whereupon she cried out with a loud cry and fell down fainting for excess of joy; but the King thought this was epilepsy brought on by her fear of him, and by her suddenly being startled. Then the Prince put his mouth to her ear and said to her, ""O Shams al-Nahar, O seduction of the universe, have a care for thy life and mine and be patient and constant; for this our position needeth sufferance and skilful contrivance to make shift for our delivery from the tyrannical King. My first move will be now to go out to him and tell him that thou art possessed of a Jinn and hence thy madness; but that I will engage to heal thee and drive away the evil spirit, if he will at once unbind thy bonds. So when he cometh in to thee, do thou speak him smooth words, that he may think I have cured thee, and all will be done for us as we desire."" Quoth she, ""Hearkening and obedience;"" and he went out to the King in joy and gladness, and said to him, ""O august King, I have, by thy good fortune, discovered her disease and its remedy, and have cured her for thee. So now do thou go in to her and speak her softly and treat her kindly, and promise her what may please her; so shall all thou desirest of her be accomplished to thee.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Three Hundred and Seventieth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Prince feigned himself a leach and went in to the damsel and made himself known to her and told her how he purposed to deliver her, she cried ""Hearkening and obedience!"" He then fared forth from her and sought the King and said, ""Go thou in to her and speak her softly and promise her what may please her; so shall all thou desirest of her be accomplished to thee."" Thereupon the King went in to her and when she saw him, she rose and kissing the ground before him, bade him welcome and said, ""I admire how thou hast come to visit thy handmaid this day;"" whereat he was ready to fly for joy and bade the waiting-women and the eunuchs attend her and carry her to the Hammam and make ready for her dresses and adornment. So they went in to her and saluted her, and she returned their salams with the goodliest language and after the pleasantest fashion; whereupon they clad her in royal apparel and, clasping a collar of jewels about her neck, carried her to the bath and served her there. Then they brought her forth, as she were the full moon; and, when she came into the King's presence, she saluted him and kissed ground before him; whereupon he joyed in her with joy exceeding and said to the Prince, ""O Sage, O philosopher, all this is of thy blessing. Allah increase to us the benefit of thy healing breath!"" The Prince replied, ""O King, for the completion of her cure it behoveth that thou go forth, thou and all thy troops and guards, to the place where thou foundest her, not forgetting the beast of black wood which was with her; for therein is a devil; and, unless I exorcise him, he will return to her and afflict her at the head of every month."" ""With love and gladness,"" cried the King, ""O thou Prince of all philosophers and most learned of all who see the light of day."" Then he brought out the ebony horse to the meadow in question and rode thither with all his troops and the Princess, little weeting the purpose of the Prince. Now when they came to the appointed place, the Prince, still habited as a leach, bade them set the Princess and the steed as far as eye could reach from the King and his troops, and said to him, ""With thy leave, and at thy word, I will now proceed to the fumigations and conjurations, and here imprison the adversary of mankind, that he may never more return to her. After this, I shall mount this wooden horse which seemeth to be made of ebony, and take the damsel up behind me; whereupon it will shake and sway to and fro and fare forwards, till it come to thee, when the affair will be at an end; and after this thou mayst do with her as thou wilt."" When the King heard his words, he rejoiced with extreme joy; so the Prince mounted the horse and, taking the damsel up behind him, whilst the King and his troops watched him, bound her fast to him. Then he turned the ascending-pin and the horse took flight and soared with them high in air, till they disappeared from every eye. After this the King abode half the day, expecting their return; but they returned not. So when he despaired of them, repenting him greatly of that which he had done and grieving sore for the loss of the damsel, he went back to the city with his troops. He then sent for the Persian who was in prison and said to him, ""O thou traitor, O thou villian, why didst thou hide from me the mystery of the ebony horse? And now a sharper hath come to me and hath carried it off, together with a slave-girl whose ornaments are worth a mint of money, and I shall never see anyone or anything of them again!"" So the Persian related to him all his past, first and last, and the King was seized with a fit of fury which well-nigh ended his life. He shut himself up in his palace for a while, mourning and afflicted; but at last his Wazirs came in to him and applied themselves to comfort him, saying, ""Verily, he who took the damsel is an enchanter, and praised be Allah who hath delivered thee from his craft and sorcery!"" And they ceased not from him, till he was comforted for her loss. Thus far concerning the King; but as for the Prince, he continued his career towards his father's capital in joy and cheer, and stayed not till he alighted on his own palace, where he set the lady in safety; after which he went in to his father and mother and saluted them and acquainted them with her coming, whereat they were filled with solace and gladness. Then he spread great banquets for the towns-folk,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Three Hundred and Seventy-first Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the King's son spread great banquets for the towns-folk and they held high festival a whole month, at the end of which time he went in to the Princess and they took their joy of each other with exceeding joy. But his father brake the ebony horse in pieces and destroyed its mechanism for flight; moreover the Prince wrote a letter to the Princess's father, advising him of all that had befallen her and informing him how she was now married to him and in all health and happiness, and sent it by a messenger, together with costly presents and curious rarities. And when the messenger arrived at the city which was Sana'a and delivered the letter and the presents to the King, he read the missive and rejoiced greatly thereat and accepted the presents, honouring and rewarding the bearer handsomely. Moreover, he forwarded rich gifts to his son-in-law by the same messenger, who returned to his master and acquainted him with what had passed; whereat he was much cheered. And after this the Prince wrote a letter every year to his father-in-law and sent him presents till, in course of time, his sire King Sabur deceased and he reigned in his stead, ruling justly over his lieges and conducting himself well and righteously towards them, so that the land submitted to him and his subjects did him loyal service; and Kamar al-Akmar and his wife Shams al-Nahar abode in the enjoyment of all satisfaction and solace of life, till there came to them the Destroyer of deligights and Sunderer of societies; the Plunderer of palaces, the Caterer for cemeteries and the Garnerer of graves. And now glory be to the Living One who dieth not and in whose hand is the dominion of the worlds visible and invisible! Moreover I have heard tell the tale of

Footnotes:
 This tale (one of those translated by Galland) is best and fullest in the Bresl. Edit. iii. 329.
 Europe has degraded this autumnal festival, the Sun-fête Mihrgán (which balanced the vernal Nau-roz) into Michaelmas and its goose-massacre. It was so called because it began on the 16th of Mihr, the seventh month; and lasted six days, with feasts, festivities and great rejoicings in honour of the Sun, who now begins his southing-course to gladden the other half of the world.
 ""Hindí"" is an Indian Moslem as opposed to ""Hindú,"" a pagan, or Gentoo.
 The orig. Persian word is ""Sháh-púr""=King's son: the Greeks (who had no sh) (preferred ); the Romans turned it into Sapor and the Arabs (who lack the p) into Sábúr. See p. x. Hamzæ ispahanensis Annalium Libri x.: Gottwaldt, Lipsiæ mdcccxlviii.
 The magic horse may have originated with the Hindu tale of a wooden Garuda (the bird of Vishnu) built by a youth for the purpose of a vehicle. It came with the ""Moors"" to Spain and appears in ""Le Cheval de Fust,"" a French poem of the thirteenth Century. Thence it passed over to England as shown by Chaucer's ""Half-told tale of Cambuscan (Janghíz Khan?) bold,"" as
""The wondrous steed of brass
On which the Tartar King did ride;""
And Leland (Itinerary) derives ""Rutlandshire"" from ""a man named Rutter who rode round it on a wooden horse constructed by art magic."" Lane (ii. 548) quotes the parallel story of Cleomades and Claremond which Mr. Keightley (Tales and Popular Fictions, chapt. ii) dates from our thirteenth century. See Vol. i., p. 160.
 All Moslems, except those of the Máliki school, hold that the maker of an image representing anything of life will be commanded on the Judgment Day to animate it, and failing will be duly sent to the Fire. This severity arose apparently from the necessity of putting down idol-worship and, perhaps, for the same reason the Greek Church admits pictures but not statues. Of course the command has been honoured with extensive breaching: for instance all the Sultans of Stambul have had their portraits drawn and painted.
 This description of ugly old age is written with true
Arab verve.
 Arab. ""Badinján"": Hind. Bengan: Pers. Bádingán or Badilján; the Mala insana (Solanum pomiferum or S. Melongena) of the Romans, well known in Southern Europe. It is of two kinds, the red (Solanum lycopersicum) and the black (S. Melongena). The Spaniards know it as ""berengeria"" and when Sancho Panza (Part ii. chapt. 2) says, ""The Moors are fond of egg-plants"" he means more than appears. The vegetable is held to be exceedingly heating and thereby to breed melancholia and madness; hence one says to a man that has done something eccentric, ""Thou hast been eating brinjalls.""
 Again to be understood Hibernice ""kilt.""
 i.e. for fear of the evil eye injuring the palace and, haply, himself.
 The ""Sufrah"" before explained acting provision-bag and table-cloth.
 Eastern women in hot weather, lie mother-nude under a sheet here represented by the hair. The Greeks and Romans also slept stripped and in mediæval England the most modest women saw nothing indelicate in sleeping naked by their naked husbands. The ""night-cap"" and the ""night-gown"" are comparatively modern inventions.
 Hindu fable turns this simile into better poetry, ""She was like a second and a more wondrous moon made by the Creator.""
 ""Sun of the Day.""
 Arab. ""Shirk""=worshipping more than one God. A theological term here most appropriately used.
 The Bul. Edit. as usual abridges (vol. i. 534). The Prince lands on the palace-roof where he leaves his horse, and finding no one in the building goes back to the terrace. Suddenly he sees a beautiful girl approaching him with a party of her women, suggesting to him these couplets,
""She came without tryst in the darkest hour, *
Like full moon lighting horizon's night:
Slim-formed, there is not in the world her like *
For grace of form or for gifts of sprite:
'Praise him who made her from semen-drop,' *
I cried, when her beauty first struck my sight:
I guard her from eyes, seeking refuge with *
The Lord of mankind and of morning-light.""
The two then made acquaintance and ""follows what follows.""
 Arab. ""Akásirah,"" explained (vol. i., 75) as the plur. of Kisrá.
 The dearest ambition of a slave is not liberty but to have a slave of his own. This was systematised by the servile rulers known in history as the Mameluke Beys and to the Egyptians as the Ghuzz. Each had his household of servile pages and squires, who looked forward to filling the master's place as knight or baron.
 The well-known capital of Al-Yaman, a true Arabia Felix, a Paradise inhabited by demons in the shape of Turkish soldiery and Arab caterans. According to Moslem writers Sana'a was founded by Shem son of Noah who, wandering southward with his posterity after his father's death, and finding the site delightful, dug a well and founded the citadel, Ghamdán, which afterwards contained a Mason Carrée rivalling (or attempting to rival) the Meccan Ka'abah. The builder was Surahbíl who, says M.C. de Perceval coloured its four faces red, white, golden and green; the central quadrangle had seven stories (the planets) each forty cubits high, and the lowest was a marble hall ceiling'd with a single slab. At the four corners stood hollow lions through whose mouths the winds roared. This palatial citadel-temple was destroyed by order of Caliph Omar. The city's ancient name was Azal or Uzal whom some identify with one of the thirteen sons of Joktan (Genesis xi. 27): it took its present name from the Ethiopian conquerors (they say) who, seeing it for the first time, cried ""Hazá Sana'ah!"" meaning in their tongue, this is commodious, etc. I may note that the word is Kisawahili (Zanzibarian) e.g. ""Yámbo sáná—is the state good?"" Sana'a was the capital of the Tabábi'ah or Tobba Kings who judaized; and the Abyssinians with their Negush made it Christian while the Persians under Anushirwán converted it to Guebrism. It is now easily visited but to little purpose; excursions in the neighborhood being deadly dangerous. Moreover the Turkish garrison would probably murder a stranger who sympathised with the Arabs, and the Arabs kill one who took part with their hated and hateful conquerors. The late Mr. Shapira of Jerusalem declared that he had visited it and Jews have great advantages in such travel. But his friends doubted him.
 The Bresl. Edit. (iii. 347) prints three vile errors in four lines.
 Alcove is a corruption of the Arab. Al-Kubbah (the dome) through Span. and Port.
 Easterns as a rule sleep with head and body covered by a sheet or in cold weather a blanket. The practice is doubtless hygienic, defending the body from draughts when the pores are open; but Europeans find it hard to adopt; it seems to stop their breathing. Another excellent practice in the East, and indeed amongst barbarians and savages generally, is training children to sleep with mouths shut: in after life they never snore and in malarious lands they do not require Outram's ""fever-guard,"" a swathe of muslin over the mouth. Mr. Catlin thought so highly of the ""shut mouth"" that he made it the subject of a book.
 Arab. ""Hanzal""=coloquintida, an article often mentioned by Arabs in verse and prose; the bright coloured little gourd attracts every eye by its golden glance when travelling through the brown-yellow waste of sand and clay. A favourite purgative (enough for a horse) is made by filling the inside with sour milk which is drunks after a night's soaking: it is as active as the croton-nut of the Gold Coast.
 The Bresl. Edit. iii. 354 sends him to the ""land of Sín""
(China).
 Arab. ""Yá Kisrawi!""=O subject of the Kisrá or Chosroë; the latter explained in vol.i.,75. ""Fars"" is the origin of ""Persia""; and there is a hit at the prodigious lying of the modern race, whose forefathers were so famous as truth-tellers. ""I am a Persian, but I am not lying now,"" is a phrase familiar to every traveller.
 There is no such name: perhaps it is a clerical error
for ""Har jáh""=(a man of) any place. I know an Englishman who in
Persian called himself ""Mirza Abdullah-i-Híchmakáni""=Master
Abdullah of Nowhere.
 The Bresl. Edit. (loc. cit.) gives a comical description of the Prince assuming the dress of an astrologer-doctor, clapping an old book under his arm, fumbling a rosary of beads, enlarging his turband, lengthening his sleeves and blackening his eyelids with antimony. Here, however, it would be out of place. Very comical also is the way in which he pretends to cure the maniac by ""muttering unknown words, blowing in her face, biting her ear,"" etc.
 Arab. ""Sar'a""=falling sickness. Here again we have in all its simplicity the old nursery idea of ""possession"" by evil spirits.
 Arab. ""Nafahát""=breathings, benefits, the Heb. Neshamah opp. to Nephesh (soul) and Ruach (spirit). Healing by the breath is a popular idea throughout the East and not unknown to Western Magnetists and Mesmerists. The miraculous cures of the Messiah were, according to Moslems, mostly performed by aspiration. They hold that in the days of Isa, physic had reached its highest development, and thus his miracles were mostly miracles of medicine; whereas, in Mohammed's time, eloquence had attained its climax and accordingly his miracles were those of eloquence, as shown in the Koran and Ahádís.Embed",en,"{'arabia', 'seventyfirst', 'folk', 'forgetfulness', 'bestow', 'continuing', 'plur', 'comparatively',

Flower field, that's where I'm at
Open land, that's where I'm at
No name, that's what I have
No shame, I'm on my grave
두 발이 땅에 닿지 않을 때
당신의 마음이 당신을 넘볼 때
꿈이 나를 집어삼킬 때
내가 내가 아닐 때
그 모든 때

불꽃을 나는 동경했었네
그저 화려하게 지고 싶었네
시작의 전부터 나 상상했었지
끝엔 웃으며 박수 쳐 줄 수 있길
나 소원했었네
믿었던 게 다 멀어지던 때
이 모든 명예가 이젠 멍에가 됐을 때
이 욕심을 제발 거둬가소서
어떤 일이 있어도
오 나를 나로 하게 하소서
Oh, every day and every night
Persistin' pain and criminal mind
내 심장소리에 잠 못 들던 밤
창밖에 걸린 청승맞은 초승달
I do wish me a lovely night
내 분수보다 비대해진 life
저기 날아오르는 풍선을 애써 쥐고
따져 물어 대체 지금 넌 어디에
Where you go, where's your soul
Yo, where's your dream?

그 어디까지가 내 마지막일까
전부 진저리 나, 하나 열까지 다
이 지긋지긋한 가면은 언제 벗겨질까
Yeah, me no hero, me no villain
아무것도 아닌 나
공회전은 반복돼 기억들은 난폭해
난 누워 들판 속에 시선을 던져 하늘 위에
뭘 원했었던 건지 이제 기억이 안 나
얻었다 믿었던 모든 행복은 겨우 찰나
Yeah, I been goin', no matter what's in front
그게 뭐가 됐건
새벽의 옷자락을 붙잡고 뭔가 토해내던 기억
목소리만 큰 자들의 사회
난 여전히 침묵을 말해
이건 방백, 완숙한 돛단배
모든 오해 편견들에 닿게
반갑지 않아 너의 헹가래
내 두 발이 여기 땅 위에
이름도 없는 꽃들과 함께
다신 별에 갈 수 없어 I can't
발밑으로 I just go
목적 없는 목적지로
슬픈 줄도 모르고
그림자마저 친구로
I be gone
저 하늘에 흩어질래
Light a flowеr, flowerwork
Flower, flowerwork
저 하늘에 눈부시게
Light a flowеr, flowerwork
Flower, flowerwork

문득 멈춰보니 찬란한 맨발
원래 내 것은 아무것도 없었지
And don't tell me like you gotta be someone
난 절대 그들처럼 될 수 없으니 (Light a flower)
그래 내 시작은 시
여태껏 날 지켜온 단 하나의 힘과 dream (Light a flower)
타는 불꽃에서 들꽃으로
소년에서 영원으로
나 이 황량한 들에 남으리
아 언젠가 나 되돌아가리

저 하늘에 흩어질래
Light a flower, flowerwork
Flower, flowerwork
저 하늘에 눈부시게
Light a flower, flowerwork
Flower, flowerwork

Flower field, that's where I'm at
Open land, that's where I'm at
No name, that's what I have
No shame, I'm on my grave
When your feet don't touch the ground
When your heart overtakes you
When dreams engulf me
when i'm not me
all those times

I longed for the flame
I just wanted to shine
I imagined it even before the start
I hope you can smile and clap at the end
i wished
When everything I believed in went far away
When all this honor is now a yoke
Please take away this greed
no matter what
oh let me be me
Oh, every day and every night
Persistin' pain and criminal mind
The night I couldn't sleep at the sound of my heart
The blue crescent moon hanging outside the window
I do wish me a lovely night
Life has grown bigger than my fountain
I try to hold on to the flying balloon over there
Ask, ask, where are you now
Where you go, where's your soul
Yo, where's your dream?
You might also like
I want to scatter in the sky
Light a flower, flowerwork
flower, flowerwork
dazzle in the sky
Light a flower, flowerwork
flower, flowerwork

Where will that end be for me?
I'm fed up with everything, one by one
When will this disgusting mask come off?
Yeah, me no hero, me no villain
I am nothing
Idling is repeated, the memories are violent
I lie down and throw my gaze into the field, above the sky
I can't remember what I wanted
All the happiness I believed I got was only for a moment
Yeah, I been goin', no matter what's in front
whatever it was
Memories of holding on to the hem of dawn and spitting out something
A society of loud voices
i still say silence
This is a prince, a mature sailboat
To reach all misunderstandings and prejudices
I'm not happy, I want to rinse you
my feet are here on the ground
with nameless flowers
I can't go to the stars again, I can't
Underfoot I just go
to an aimless destination
I don't even know you're sad
Even the shadows are friends
I be gone
I want to scatter in the sky
Light a flow, flowerwork
flower, flowerwork
dazzle in the sky
Light a flow, flowerwork
flower, flowerwork

I suddenly stopped and saw my brilliant bare feet
Originally nothing was mine
And don't tell me like you gotta be someone
I can never be like them (Light a flower)
yes my beginning is
The only strength and dream that has protected me so far (Light a flower)
From burning flames to wild flowers
boy to eternity
I will remain in this desolate field
oh i will come back someday

I want to scatter in the sky
Light a flower, flowerwork
flower, flowerwork
dazzle in the sky
Light a flower, flowerwork
flower, flowerwork
Flower field, that's where I'm at
Open land, that's where I'm at
No name, that's what I have

When dreams engulf me
when i am not me

City talkin', we takin' notes
Tell 'em all to keep makin' posts
Wish he could, but he can't get close
OG so proud of me that he chokin' up while he makin' toasts
I'm the type that you can't control, said I would, then I made it so
I don't clear up rumors (Ayy), where's y'all sense of humor? (Ayy)
I'm done makin' jokes 'cause they got old like baby boomers
Turned my haters to consumers, I make vets feel like they juniors (Juniors)
Say your time is comin' soon, but just like Oklahoma (Mmm)
Mine is comin' sooner (Mmm), I'm just a late bloomer (Mmm)
I didn't peak in high school, I'm still out here gettin' cuter (Woo)
All these social networks and computers
Got these pussies walkin' 'round like they ain't losers
I told you long ago on the road

Go buy a zip of weed, hit the club
Pay for 'bout ten niggas to get in
We crunk, lit, in this bitch, yeah
Know we walk around the world
Steppin', not givin a damn 'bout where our feet land at, yeah
Get your ass mushed, smooshed (6ix)
Yeah, 21, the biggest
Put a nigga in the chicken wing, pussy

21, can you do somethin' for me? (21)
Can you hit a lil' rich flex for me? (21)
And 21, can you do somethin' for me? (21, 21)
Drop some bars to my pussy ex for me
Then 21 (21), can you do somethin' for me? (Yeah)
Can you talk to the opps necks for me? (Okay)
21, do your thing 21, do your thing (21)
Do your thing, 21, do your thing

Yellow diamonds in the watch, this shit cost a lot
Never send a bitch your dot, that's how you get shot
I DM in Vanish Mode, I do that shit a lot
Took her panties off and this bitch thicker than the plot
All my exes ain't nothin', them hoes busted
If my opps ain't rappin', they ass duckin'
You ain't ready to pull the trigger, don't clutch it
I know you on your period baby, can you suck it?
I'm a savage (21)
Smack her booty in Magic (21, 21)
I'll slap a pussy nigga with a ratchet (Pussy)
I might slap a tracker on his whip and get the addy (Pussy)
Don't call me on Christmas Eve, bitch, call your daddy (21)
Bitch, call your uncle (21), bitch, don't call me (21)
Always in my ear, your ho a flea (Fuck)
Why my opps be posting guns and only use they feet? (21)

Pussies cliquin' up so they don't feel alone, ayy
Nan' nigga seein' me, I'm Young Money CMB
I used to roll with CMG, the house is not a BNB
The bad bitches waitin' on a nigga like I'm PND
I'm steady pushin' P, you niggas pushing PTSD
I told her ass to kiss me in the club, fuck a TMZ
I used to want a GMC, when Woe was doing B&E
We revvin' up and goin' on a run like we DMC
I layup with her for a couple days, then its BRB
You rappers love askin' if I fucked, when you know we did
When you know we did
She came in heels but she left out on her cozy shit
Ayy, I'm livin' every twenty-four like Kobe did
Shoutout to the 6ix, R.I.P to 8
Swear this shit is gettin' ate, I'm on ten for the cake
Get a lot of love from twelve, but I don't reciprocate
Fifty-one division stay patrollin' when it's late

All the dawgs eatin' off a Baccarat plate
Niggas see Drake and they underestimate
Take it from a vet', that's a rookie ass mistake, ayy

You got me feelin' so right, yeah
It's a vibe

Yeah, eh
This gon' be the one and only theme song
너에게만 고정된 내 시선
내겐 너란 하나뿐인 mission
불가능은 없어, baby, lights, camera, action
나란 음악 위에 너는 topline
너란 도시 위에 나는 skyline
넌 내 영화 속에 highlight
어두운 밤하늘 끝에 twilight

Just gets better
너를 처음부터 정주행하고 싶은 매력

짜릿해 손만 잡아도 감전
너를 만나기 전까지 내 세상은 암전
나란 무대 위에 너는 spotlight
너란 한강 위에 나는 남산
더 완벽할 순 없잖아
어두운 밤하늘 끝에 twilight

I could feel it
너란 공간에 갇혀버렸어 you're my Matrix
You don't know I want your love (Know I want your love)

Yeah, eh
This gon' be the one and only theme song
My gaze is fixed only on you
To me, you are the only mission
Nothing is impossible, baby, lights, camera, action
Above my music, you are the topline
Above the city that is you, I am the skyline
You are a highlight in my movie

Just gets better

It’s thrilling, even if you hold my hand, you get an electric shock
Until I met you, my world was dark
On the stage that is me, you are a spotlight
Namsan Mountain above the Han River that is you

Wohi fool kaante, jab jaage tum sirahne na the
Dhoondhte thikaane ye awaaj meri goonjti
Sawaal kare tujhse kyun ab haal bhi nahi puchti
Ho chuke behaal toh wo mere baare sochti
Kalam kamaan, inn lafzo ko kaise rokti
Zulfon me uljhe, teri shaayari kya khaak kare
Munh pe anjaan bane, fursat me yaad kare
Zakham ye taaje, maslahat yahi na baat kare
Aaj bhi log inn lafzo ke mohtaaj rahe

I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright
Baby, I'ma have the best fuckin' night of my life
And wherever it takes me, I'm down for the ride
Baby, don't you know I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright
'Cause I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright
Baby, I'ma have the best fuckin' night of my life
And wherever it takes me, I'm down for the ride
Baby, don't you know I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright

Don't you know I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright

You know I'm down for whatever tonight
I don't need the finer things in life
No matter where I go, it's a good time, yeah
And I, I don't need to sit in VIP
Middle of the floor, that's where I'll be
Don't got a lot, but that's enough for me, yeah

'Cause I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright
Baby, I'ma have the best fuckin' night of my life

I don't believe in soulmates, but
Teri nazaron ne dil ka kiya jo
Hashar, asar ye hua
Ab inamen hee doob ke ho jaanoon
Paar, yahi hai dua

Yeah, your eyes got my heart falling for you
You're messing with my heart and I still wanna love you
I wanna spend my life drowning in your eyes
It's my only prayer
Your eyes got my heart falling for you
You're messing with my heart and I still wanna love you
I wanna spend my life drowning in your eyes
It's my only prayer, yeah
