They say, ""Oh my god, I see the way you shine
Take your hands, my dear, and place them both in mine""
You know you stopped me dead while I was passing by
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time

1,1,1,Lewis Capaldi,Someone You Loved,"216 ContributorsTranslationsSvenskaEspañolPortuguêsDeutschNederlandsSomeone You Loved Lyrics
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
You might also like
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around

For now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

You were the shadow to my light
Did you feel us?
Another star, you fade away
Afraid our aim is out of sight
Wanna see us alight

Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Was it all in my fantasy?
Where are you now?
Were you only imaginary?

Where are you now?
Atlantis, under the sea, under the sea
Where are you now? Another dream
The monster's running wild inside of me
I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded

These shallow waters never met what I needed
I'm letting go, a deeper dive
Eternal silence of the sea
I'm breathing, alive

Tell me somethin', girl

In all the good times, I find myself longin'

Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?

In all the good times, I find myself longing

4,4,4,Victor Leksell,Svag,"13 ContributorsSvag Lyrics
Visa dem hur stark du är
Låt dem aldrig se dig fälla tårar
Det är så jag växte upp
Var bara en man och ta det
Allting är okej om någon frågar
Det är så det vart för mig
Och jag kan lyfta flera tusen kilo
Och jag kan ta mig över hav och land
Kan göra nästan allt de ber om

Men jag kan inte va i samma rum som dig
Utan att jag tappar andan
Och varje gång du ser på mig
Känns som att mitt hjärta stannar
Försöker spela svår och stå emot
Men du river mina murar
Jag vet inte vad du gör
Men allting som du gör, det gör mig svag

Våga släppa taget nu
Sluta vara rädd för att bli sårad
Det är så det måste va
Det är väl bara så det är
Kan ändå inte fatta det
För jag kan göra nästan allt de ber om

Jag vet inte vad du gör
Men allting som du gör, det gör mig svag

Aldrig våga visa mig svag
Men med dig blir det en annan sak
Med dig finns inget annat val
Med dig så vill jag vara svag
Nu vill jag bara va i samma rum som dig
Och jag vågar tappa andan
Och varje gång du ser på mig
Vill jag bara att tiden stannar

Men jag kan inte va i samma rum som dig
Utan att jag tappar andan
Och varje gång du ser på mig
Känns som att mitt hjärta stannar
Försöker spela svår och stå emot
Men du river mina murar

Show them how strong you are
Never let them see you shed tears
That's how I grew up 
Just be a man and take it
It's all right if someone asks
That's how it was for me
And I can lift several thousand kilos
And I can cross sea and land
Can do almost anything they ask

But I can't be in the same room as you
Without losing my breath
And every time you look at me
Feels like my heart is stopping
Trying to play hard and resist
But you tear down my walls
I don't know what you do
But everything you do, it makes me weak

Dare to let go now
Stop being afraid of getting hurt
That's the way it has to be
It's just the way it is
Still can't believe it
Because I can do almost anything they ask

But everything you do, it makes me weak

Never dare to show me weakness
But with you it becomes a different matter
With you there is no other choice
With you, I want to be weak
Now I just want to be in the same room as you
And I dare to lose my breath
And every time you look at me
I just want time to stop

But I can't be in the same room as you
Without losing my breath
And every time you look at me
Feels like my heart is stopping
Trying to play hard and resist
But you tear down my walls

J'suis dans des bails de malade, pas de mala, pas de cala, peu de câlins (rah, rah, rah)
Pas de calibre, une pensée aux frères pas libres, à ceux qui rêvent de palettes ou de conduire la Ferrari (wouh)
Pas b'soin de palettes au volant (non, non), j'suis dans la soucoupe volante (non)

7.65 près des couilles, ça bosse pas la zone abdominale

Ça tourne comme des civ' en automatique, tout niquer en équipe, c'est la thématique
Pour le territoire, entre ennemis, ça s'éradique, sous shit et alcool, t'es tarpin lunatique

Que veux-tu que j'te dise de plus ? J'vise la tête ou je vise le but
Le paradis est sous les pieds de ta mère mais t'es un fils de pute

Y a la fusée dans le Grinder, calibré comme les Peaky Blinders
J'vois loin dans les étoiles, ah, et j'vois qu'tu es sûr de toi, ah
Moula, moula, de té-cô, kichta lourde en mandat de dépôt
Moula, moula, de té-cô, kichta lourde en mandat de dépôt
J'suis sur la Corniche, j'fais le Tony, la gow est bombée dans le bolide (ouais)
Bernard Tapie au bout du fil (allô, allô), j'suis immortel comme le COVID
Elle fait la fille bien, j'veux une coquine, terr-terr, pin-pon, c'est la routine
C'est Marseille, salope, c'est pas Brooklyn, c'est Marseille, salope, c'est pas Brooklyn
Prince de la ville dans le binks, j'fais le biff en équipe comme dans Heat (comme dans Heat)

Tu veux appeler l'dire ou applaudir, garde la monnaie, tu peux arrondir
Elle a un sale boule, je veux rebondir, si je tire, c'dans la carotide

Sur le bitume, j'fais du Billie Jean, c'est bouillant, c'est la canicule
40 degrés à l'ombre, c'est les Philippines
T'as reconnu le matricule, tête cramée dans la tribune, y a la zone, y a la tribu, attitude depuis le début (le début)
Le J me fait la passe, unh, et moi, je mets le but (le but)
Je me regarde dans la glace, unh, j'ai jamais fait la pute
Pour avoir la classe, pas besoin de notice, ça fait bang, bang, bang, c'est l'agonie, la police
On les aime pas, c'est la folie, j'vise la lucarne comme le coup d'tête de Boli
Abonné, j'suis dans le bolide, j'm'en bats les couilles de Clyde et Bonnie
Ça s'propage comme le COVID, j'suis dans les airs comme un Boeing
Alcoolisé, dans le bordel, elle a sympathisé
Elle a trop sucé, on s'en bat les couilles, on la f'ra resucer
On est trop rusés, sans l'succès, on s'est quand même propulsés

Oui Paris, c'est magique (magique), mais Marseille reste unique (ouais)
Ici, y a pas d'limites (limites), champion dans l'foot et l'shit
Bloqués dans l'tiekson, certains voient pas plus loin que Lançon
Merco GTS, conduite normale sous ballons (hmm, ouais)
Fourgon d'armes de l'Est, camion semi plein d'ballots
La moula jaune, ouais (la moula jaune), comme la Bonne Mère, les cigales sonnent ouais, jusqu'à la Canebière
En crabe sur les RR 1000, j'passe par les rues où y a pas d'civils (vroum, vroum)
Fond d’cinq’, j'suis à Bougainville, j'passe faire un tour vers le centre-ville
Ah putain, j'ai le pétard dans le jean, cache-le vite, y a les hams (paw, paw)
Grosse kichta qui s'allume comme Billie Jean, 3.5.5 dans le sac, oh

Je baise ma vida, j'vais m'vider, j'vais piler, c'est la fin, fume ton dernier pilon
J'suis serein, t'es nerveux, J't'ouvre la tête au marteau, t'es un d'ces fils de chien qui retient que le seul nom
Je m'endors c'est la guerre, j'me réveille, c'est la même
Ouais ça fait très longtemps qu'on a banni la paix
Je sors du forgeron, je parle une première fois, la deuxième fois je te fends le crâne a l'épée
20 heures de cellule sur 24, à 3 dans un 9 mètres carré, 40 degrés je suffoque
J'connais les tes-traî, ouais toujours en retrait, jamais d'la vida j'tourne mon dos, gros je pivote
La Grinta, du monde dans les gradins, se lève et m'applaudit, moi, j'attends la Ôla
J'suis numéro 9, c'est moi qui plante les butes, et je choque comme cartel de Sinaloa (brrw)
Parlez, parlez ça fait guili-guili
1.3, 0.9, j'suis frais comme les Guirri
J'suis vrai comme un DZ, j'suis vrai comme Valkyrie
Je reviens du désert, j'ai très gros appétit
Ça remplit un chargeur et ça l'vide dans ta mère
Rajoute deux-trois zéros sur mon putain d'salaire, sur mon putain d'vécu, sur mon putain de compte
Sur mon putain de score, ouais, la putain d'ta mère

Vite fait, bien fait, j'pose le truc, machin qui frotte mon fute
3.5 tout black, t'sais qu'ça pique
L'équipe 1.3, t'sais qu'ça kick
Toi, reste à sec, p'tit insecte
On s'fait solo, nique ta secte, j'taffe sans cesse
J'veux pas d'C.C, un peu d'Vovo décomplexe
RS4 break, que des têtes au carbo, ça travaille les pecs sans penser aux abdos (ouais)
Tu vois là, l'beat, j'l'ai choppé par l'cou, même à 46, tu vas l'saigner partout
Crochet dans les artères, p'tite merde
C'est plus des gifles mais des balles qui s'perdent
La jalousie, pour moi, c'est un mystère, comme ceux qui pompent fort un peu comme leur sister (comme leur sister)
T'as reconnu l'accent d'en bas (ah ouais), fais pas celui qu'entend pas (ah ouais)
On va te mêler comme Tong Po, tu trahis, nan, c'est pas sympa (eh ouais)
Fais nous la passe le J, bah ouais, tout le Sud réuni, bah ouais
C'est fini, donc n'insiste pas, à mes yeux tu n'existes pas

6h du mat', je dors pas, j'écris des rimes hors-pair
J'm'en sors pas, tu sais comment je compte faire
C'est le retour de la Soude, on reprend du service
Faut des sous et y faut les faire vite
Le son, c'est de la bombe, tu l'entends, tu sers fils
T'en voulais, t'es servi
Ne fais pas la bombe, tu peux pas me plaire miss
Car tu fais trop la folle comme c'est pas permis
Bang bang bang j'arrive comme un Fayzer
Dans les rues de Mars' avec le flow assassin
Ça veut piquer la gadji de ton poto, c'est malsain
Oh, fils de pute (gros fils de pute)
C'est Massilia, on est des milliers, on veut des milliards, on prend l'or s'il y est
Ouais c'est Massilia, gros, c'est la guérilla, là, c'est la série A, 1.3.9, c'est sérieux
J'crois qu'il mon pris pour un con, hein, j'crois que j'vais péter un plomb, hein
J'croise les doigts et je compte, il m'dit : ""Tu vas faire quoi ?"", j'vais sortir un pompe
C'est les quartiers Sud au volant, 1.3.9, c'est affolant
Demande à mes collègues, ne crois pas qu'j'suis à fond, là
Tu veux tester mais t'es trop lent, j't'efface en rigolant
J'envoie un freestyle et tout le quartier fait la ola

Place au pirate (place au pirate), voiture full black (voiture full black)
Aujourd'hui, j'fais le mac', j'mets le bandeau à Tupac
Sur moi, j'ai une plaquette, 308 break : c'est la bac
Pare-balles et les claquettes, j'suis cramou, j'crois qu'ils me traquent
J'ai pas changé d'époque, j'suis toujours sous bob
J'croise une gadji, elle m'dit : ""Tu rappes bien, mon bébé""
J'suis dans la loc', j'passe à la lim'
J'crois qu'cette histoire va se finir à Pépé
Lacoste TN, le boss, toute l'année, rien qu'je bosse
J'ai même plus le temps d'me poser, j'vois les potos sous rosé

Changement, j'arrive dans le temps mort, si tu m'fais la passe, ça va faire but
Y a des putes qui font des mecs en or, des filles bien qui font des fils de pute
Sur la côte en Bande organisée, que des carbos chargés dans le 4x4
T'as vu l'gang, tu veux sympathiser, grosse équipe de vikings barbue comme à Kattegatt
Trop de coups de salope et je suis consterné, que tu t'inventes des vies, arrête, on t'a cerné
Ça prend la route, ça pilote avec les g'noux, ça roule un pétard à 15h encore les yeux cernés
Ton blaze est noté sur le carnet, p'tite merde, dis-moi qui tu voulais berner ?
À la base, t'étais un mec bien, en kehba : tu t'es réincarné
J'traine avec des mecs clean, j'traine avec des mecs louches
J'traine avec des Kevin, des Marvin, j'traine avec des mecs chouch
Posté sur le terrain, toute l'année, toi t'es sur le banc d'touche
Chaud comme elle sentait fort, tous ses morts, na3teha bain d'bouche

C'est Marseille, poto, tempère, un clic-clic dans l'fute pour t'enterrer
Ça claque la kichta loin du terrain, minimum, on brisera tous tes rêves
Le Soleil s'lève pour tout l'monde, toi, t'es à l'ouest (à l'ouest)
En Moonwalk, on débarque à l'aise (à l'aise)
Dans le Vito, j'recompte la somme et là, midi-minuit, j'suis pump it up
Hola chica, ¿ me gusta tu ? Vura vura, ne bois pas tout
Tu trouves ça embêtant, qu'à la fin, ça t'met pas dedans
Trop d'gentils jouent les méchants, devant l'canon deviennent tout doux
Ils manquent du shit dans l'secteur, ça l'ravitaille en Subaru

13 Organisé, bordélique, grosse équipe, venue frapper comme un corps d'élite
Marseille trace sa route hors des pistes, hors des pistes, bordélique
Y a ceux que la Haute dénigre (aie), passe entre les gouttes de pluie
Rimeur de feu, plie en freestyle, enfant du cagnard a trop de style
Aller, aller, faut laisser passer, parole d'hier est toujours valable
Cruelle, insolente et restée vraie, éclats inespérés dans nos palabres
Arkana, loin des radars (oui, oui), capuchée comme La Rabia (ah)
Un gros doigt devant vos caméras, le smile des favelas malgré les drames, hélas (oy)

J'suis l'reflet de ma zone, puche-caté sous l'Aston, hey
En PV, elle m'aborde, en public, elle veut qu'on s'pète, hey
Quand t'es discrète, c'est bon dél', ils m'ont déféré pour m'libérer, fais l'bisou à ton bae
On fait pas crari, du bloc au siège de la Ferrari
Les Marseillais cramés sur Paris
J'en veux une qui poucave pas son mari
C'est des bambinos, à la place, 
À la place de s'plaindre, fais les choses mi primo
13 Organisé dans la Benz à Ciro

Fais pas l'voyou, t'vas t'manger l'revers à Nadal
Tu fais le fou mais pas d'manies avec Madame
La vie, c'est chaud (c'est chaud)
Sur Paris, c'est chaud (c'est chaud)
Sous vodka, Capri Sun, mes pensées sont bien sombres
Quand elle bouge dans la salle, j'aimerai l'avoir pour moi seul
Solo (solo), solo (solo), pour moi seul
Solo (solo), solo (solo), pour moi seul
Elle est pleine de manières mais j'ai fini solo
Elle est belle, elle est mimi mais j'ai fini solo
Solo, solo, ouais, solo, ouais, solo, mais j'ai fini solo

On connaît le mitard (ouais), on connait le danger (ouais)
Ici, y a pas de blabla, pour la monnaie, ça blague pas, fais gaffe, ils vont te manger (ouais)
On arrive au quartier (ouais), tout le monde a plongé (ouais)
Les petits sont barbares, font des trucs de bâtards, vraiment, tout a changé (ouais)
Plus de respect (nan, nan), ils veulent tous se venger (ouais, ouais)
Ils ont pris la confiance, ils ont plus de conscience, ils veulent plus s'arranger (ouais, ouais)
Plus de respect (nan, nan), ils veulent tous se venger (ouais, ouais)
Ils ont pris la confiance, ils ont plus de conscience, ils veulent plus s'arranger (ouais, ouais)

Eyah, voilà Sopra' mbaba, eyah, Sopra' Saitama, eyah
Bientôt plus connu qu'Halliday, eyah
QN dans le sang, eyah, quetas dans le son, eyah
Choqué quand tu lis mon CV, eyah
T'as mis une croix sur Marseille car tu sais qu'c'est là qu'est l'trésor
13 Organisé pour l'oseille, normal, ici, c'est les Cités d'or
La Bonne Mère : la huitième merveille
On est vrai depuis les dinosaures
Y a vos rappeurs dans nos cendriers, eyah

En position, j'ai la fenêtre de tir, donne-moi le go, on me mandate et je tue
Celui qui fait le plus cramé qu'en dit le plus aux stup'
C'est souvent les proches qui seront les plus grosses putes
Le mec, il investit, mes couilles, il veut le bénéfice
T'es pas rentré avec la merde comme père et fils
Véridique (han), vérifie, une frappe de bâtard, DP qui fait la passe décisive, nan
Si t'as la haine, y a la médecine douce, au loin, je vois ta grand-mère en train de faire le signe JuL
On va épargner les femmes et les enfants
13 Organisé à l'infini comme un puit sans fond

Minuit sur la Daytona, le charbon ferme, c'est pas raisonnable
Y a des clients qui viennent de Saint-Cannat, en Clio 3 remplie de nanas
4 heures : j'arrive pas à dormir, j'appelle Smogo, direction l'after
J'fais des tout droit, y a une queue d'bâtard, j'repère une blonde, c'est un avatar
13 Organisé, fuck la banalisée, tu vas analyser, tu vas réaliser
Même alcoolisé, t'inquiète, on sait tous viser
Même alcoolisé, t'inquiète, on sait tous viser
Shouf, la collision, le boulon, y a tout l'monde, on nique ta mère au harpon
Réponds quand tu me dois du bifton, des litrons, ouais, j'vais compter les moutons en prison
La rotonde en marche arrière, ça fait longtemps qu'j'suis plus locataire
À Corbière, j'vais plonger en équerre, organisé dans la ville comme des dockers, ouais
La rotonde en marche arrière, ça fait longtemps qu'j'suis plus locataire
À Corbière, j'vais plonger en équerre, organisé dans la ville comme des dockers, ouais

Marseille, c'est l'meilleur, mon frère, ça date pas d'hier
Né au cœur d'la haine avec une mentalité meurtrière
Nous sommes des briquets allumés dans la poudrière
Ça fait ""boom"", que des hommes, tu l'ressens, ça résonne
Monte le son à balle, j'suis la voix de la jungle
Pour ceux en cavale, empegué ou à jeun
J'fais pas le voyou mais s'il faut, j'sors le machin
J'représente le 13 de Tokyo à Agen
Le revers à Nadal, j'fais péter la raquette
Fais pas trop la mignonne, j'te baise sur la moquette
Ravale ma fierté, j'suis qu'un homme sur la planète
Et j'dis merci à JuL, il m'a sorti d'la retraite, Tonyno

MC du ShootStar (ouais), bande de bâtards (ouais)
Faut éviter les radars, 50 frères à ma table
50 frères à ma table, j'ai chargé la AK au volant du A4
J'envoie la frappe, t'es khapta
J'connais bien ta maman, tu peux m'appeler ""papa""
Ra-ta-ta-ta, la mule, c'est ta tata
J'ai pas l'vague à l'âme, j'suis prêt pour l'Valhalla

Y a tout Marseille sur l'titre, ça sent le classique, sent le hit
Ça sent la rue, ça sent le shit, j'entends déjà les rageux parler dans le vide
Parle mais ton flow est mort dans le film, j'suis dans le sale, j'suis dans le dîn
J'suis dans le stade, j'suis dans la ville, j'suis dans le stud', j'suis dans ma suite
J'fais dans le dur, j'fais dans le sweet, frère
J'suis pas dans la série mais j'suis validé
12 mesures dans le barillet
Passe au contrôle qualité, flow bien calibré, zone 13 quadrillée

Hasta la muerte, 13 Organisé, l'projet est lourd, gros, t'as pas idée
C'est QLF, wesh yo, pas de pression, laissons passer les mauvais garçons (akha)
J'ai vu ta sœur en caleçon, vas-y, descends, arrête de regarder les nichons (akha)
Le J dans la maison, arrête de faire le mec qui parle trop, on va te baisons
Et tu as vu, j'ai pas mis la veste, torse nu comme à Bucarest
Elle est bonne, elle veut que j'la baise, nique ta mère, on te laisse les restes

Organisé, 13, calibré, dans l'tieks, y a le CZ chargé (chargé)
Maintenant, vide la caisse ou alors, j't'agresse comme un vrai Marseillais (brr)
J'pense à la folle qu'j'ai cassée, aux frères au shtar qui s'tuent au pasta (pasta)
J'récupère, j'envoie un placé, toi, t'es un faux boy, fais demi, trace (trace)
J'arrive à fond, fais de la place, dans la 'teille, j'vide la canette, han
Sur scène, j'arrive en claquettes comme le J et j'fume sur la plaquette, han (plaquette)
Et pas mercé, t'as tout claqué au tiercé (tiercé)
On sait qu't'es en train de nous pister
On sait que tu tapes la C, non, fucking, non, non

J'remonte la pente en SLR, c'est nous les boss, bande de comiques
Ils sont nombreux, j'vais faire un strike comme une grosse partie de bowling
T'as le nez dans la farine, moi, j'ai les épaules solides
Dans la Matrix, j'suis dans X-Men, j'suis dans un film comme Wolverine
J'suis avec la zone en personne, t'es dans les bouchons, tu klaxonnes
13 Organisé, ça cartonne, passe à La Caste', ça charbonne

1.3, nous le sommes, partout dans le sale, ça mise dans le son, ça mise dans le sale
68 000 vaillants dans le stade, 100 000 dans le sac, s'amuse dans le sale
Tire-nous vers le haut, pas dans la tête, jamais formaté, vas-y, calmate
On va tout gâter et ouais, ma gâtée, t'aimes te faire mater, vas-y, callate
Ah, ah, poto, que pasa ? C'est notre quart d'heure, coup du pied, Carter
La bella ragazza, c'est notre quatre-heures, a mi casa, cité Carter
C'est Marseille, bébé, on t'a déjà dit, la Kala' sortie du capéo
Pour les gens d'en bas, plus de tragédie, lève ton verre et zumba caféw

À travers les baffles, j'te mets des biffles, j'ai vendu la came, j'ai fait du chiffre
Yo, la police me traque et les bâtards me pistent, j'suis à bord du Zodiac, Jack Da' au fond d'une crique
Y a pas d'intérim dans la zone comme Kery, on est des enfants terribles, calibrés comme Guirri
Entrée sur l'périph', de la drogue dans l'ferri, de l'autre côté d'la rive, dans le brouillard, j'navigue
J'ai cellophané mon passé, j'l'ai laissé à l'appart'
J'avais une vie sans options, j'vais la changer en appart'
J'ai cellophané mon passé, j'l'ai laissé à l'appart'
J'avais une vie sans options, j'vais la changer en appart'

Charcle les kilos comme un libéro (eh), ravitaille toute la French Riviera
13.0.15, c'est le numéro (eh), en temps et en heure, on vous livrera
Y a trop d'homicides, pas d'super-héros, les mains sales dans la street, qui les lavera ?
J'vis la zone, c'est la vraie, y a pas d'caméras, j'fais la 'sique et la suite : qui vivra, verra
Mets du Jack et des ices dans le gobelet, j'suis léwé, j'fais le beau, quand tu tarbala
Plus le temps, j'vois plus l'heure sous la jubilé, j'en roule un, en roue libre, c'est d'la Dybala

Très organisé comme dans Heat, le chemin est long et dur comme ma bite
Vas-y fais le fou qu'on rapplique, on t'envoie des piques on t'la pique super rapide
Salope, t'as fait la pute on te veut plus dans l'équipe, j'suis entouré d'cramés que tu vois pas dans les clips
Tu pries pour des lovés, on prie pour que Dieu nous guide
Et quand y a des tes-traî, on prie Dieu pour qu'ils nous quittent
Ma gadji, elle est chargée, chargée
Ma Kalash', elle est chargée, chargée
Ils font les fous mais les gars sachez, sachez
Que c'est cagoulé qu'on va les chercher

Sois le bienvenu dans l'13, 13
Même si on est connu pour les pa-pa-pa-pa
Sois le bienvenu dans l'13, 13
Même si on est connu pour les pa-pa-pa-pa
M.A.R.S, Les Oliviers, c'est la zone, faut qu'on encaisse
Des grosses sommes en vitesse, faut des mapes' pour la madre, c'est chaud, faut de l'espèce
Moi, j'reste hip-hop et ça, depuis longtemps
Salope, vas-y tiens prends ça dans tes dents

Seul dans ma tête, j'mets les pleins phares, pied droit collé au plancher
Trahison nocturne, cauchemars, 1.3, danger
Gros culs, chichas, ballons, welcome 13 Organisé
C'est la guérilla, donc prévient Macron que La Marseillaise, on va la remixer
On va te faire du sale, et t'as pas idée, te faire danser, comme t'as pas idée
Demande à Gastambide, Validé, Marseille City, ouais, qualité
Viens pas chez nous, on va pas t'aimer, fais pas le fou, ça va pas t'aider (hey)
Et si tu parles de foot, d'étoiles et de coupe, on est les seuls qui l'ont soulevée
Et ouais mon pote (hey), quoi d'neuf les folles (hey), en direct d'la zone (hey), c'est Vinz, tu connais

J'arrive en , Tokarev, détonation devant le bloc ça veut brasser comme  dans Blow
Sur la côte en Christian Dior on fait les beaux, FrèresJ enfoiré
13 organisé, j'suis au hazi, paire de Yeezy, argent easy
Dans la cuisine, pochon est vert, j'ai pas fini, c'est trop facile
Notre mode de vie, il vous fascine, bande d'enculés
Numéro 4, j'soulève la coupe, Basile Boli, fais moi la passe j'mets un bowlin
J'ai l'attitude d'puis ma jolie, ça vient d'en bas, c'est la folie, j'suis avec l'ovni

Hey yo, ouais c'est Marseille p'tit cœur, si t'as la mentale tu seras ma baby girl
Hey yo, 6 colis dans l'secteur, ouais on t'ramène que la frappe même devant l'inspecteur
Hey yo, on a la Champion's League, hein, on vous laisse Neymar et la Ligue 1
Pas l'temps c’est chaud dans la ville, y'a les schmits 
Plus de 13 , et j'ai beau  on fait des bails
Ça descend grosse kichta vers l'Espagne, ça remonte, distrib', tasse la maille

Marseille, c'est malade, Coca ou salade
J'suis dans les parages, j'recherche une Kalash'
Tête dans les nuages, la douane au péage
Les petits vont te faire 4000 la Kalash'
Appel d'Algérie, le couz' veut un visa, la p'tite a grandi, donne son cul à Ibiza
Frère, t'es trop bizarre (ouais, t'es trop bizarre)
On va t'faire glisser sans pitié comme Ivar
Zipette, pépette, vol à la tirette, chica chica, la p'tite aime les galipettes
Showcase à Phuket, touche pas la mallette, le P.38 est caché dans l'appuie-tête
Eh ouais c'est l'Algé', ra-ta-ta j'vais t'apprendre à danser (hey)
J'fais des hits chaque été, là, c'est l'hiver, j'vais t'apprendre à rapper

RS6 sur la Corniche, ça va vite
J'ai chauffé la miss et les disques
Y a de l'oeil dans l'air, sa mère, ça ma fatigué
J'ai mis la cagoule, j'suis rentré dans le 13 Organisé
Qu'est-ce tu as, tu veux qu'on s'tape ?
Ok, chez moi on démarre au quart de tour
Même chez toi, tu m'entends partout
1.3 gravé sur l'bambou

Yeah, on arrive en ville comme Balavoine
Déstresse, l'ouvreuse n'a pas vu la douane
Devenu Jedi, le jeune padawan, on n'oublie pas l'époque où on n'avait r-one (eh)
Chemin de la Bigotte, que tu prends la mâche, que tu bouges, tu gigottes (hey, hey)
Descends du nord comme Visigoths, que ça paranoïd, gros, que ça psychote
Eh, eh, bande organisée (ouais, ouais, ouais)
Eh, eh, sors le cross volé (ouais, ouais, ouais)

Fais pas l'con papy, j'te mets au tapis
J'suis dans l'ombre tapi, pendant qu'tu tapines
Psychothérapie, emmerdeur de base
J'suis dans la partie comme un vendeur de taz
Whisky ice, Marseille vice, 13, très au point, très organized
Hypnotized, c'est une prise d'otage, c'est pas d'la folie, c'est du pilotage
Roule, comme Jo la Mitraille, dis-moi si j'te saoule
Je n'ai pas le time pour ces fils de poules
Avant qu'je me taille, j'fais le signe de JuL (le signe de Ju-Ju-JuL)

De retour sur les prémices, entends ces folles qui gémissent
Marseille, tu le sais, miss, on fait des aces comme au tennis
Boss One et Mombi s'adaptent, on est disque d'or, nous, ça date
Style : en survet' ou cravate, dans l'rap, on te met des savates

Testarossa pour mes lauds-sa, 1.4.3 sur le dossard
La rue, la vraie, elle ne blague pas
T'es une chochotte, vas-y, drah çà
Testarossa pour mes lauds-sa, 1.4.3 sur le dossard
La rue, la vraie, elle ne blague pas
T'es une chochotte, vas-y, drah çà

J'suis l'frère d'une star depuis la primaire
Donc les jaloux, les lovés, les gens louches, les gens vrais, les mauvais
Vérité, on connait, on connait, ça parle mal en public et s'excuse en privé
J'suis dans l'espace, j'rentre partout, j'prends tout et j'pars
Poto, j'suis en croco, défouraille la compo'
Pas de bimbo, pas de mytho, pas de m'zigues dans la Vuitton
J'ai les locks dans le guidon, j'vide mon sac
Eh oui, papa, j'ai le flow pam-pam, mi corazón, tu aimes ma zone, scooter, peuf peuf

J'fume ma chicha en Fiat 500, en semaine, on est plein de flics, descentes
Bouge-toi de là que je mette l'essence, j'ai vidé mon carburant dans la piste de danse
Oui, ok, je vous pisse sur les dents, c'est ma façon de vous dire ""bonjour"" poliment
M'en bats les couilles qu'tu sois le meilleur, nous, on donne toujours l'meilleur
Ailleurs, on voit le néant, Marseille, c'est notre régiment

C'est moi le petit bâtard qui fait trembler cette putain d'ville (eh)
J'entends que des ragots, mais dis-moi, frérot, on flippe de qui, nous ? (eh)
Tu connais ma team (eh), la monnaie du shit qui nous active (eh)
Que des vantards, starfoullah, retiens-moi, j'vais faire une dinguerie
Viens voir dans ma ville, poursuites, braquages, bendo
Qué pasa bellissima, reste tranquille ou prends l'métro
C'est bête, elle me filoche (eh), appelle de phares dans l'rétro
Dans l'réseau depuis minot (eh), fais beleck à la Mondéo
Pour kichta, j'assassine, ça boit du Coca dans la bassine
Quand tu dors, on tartine, j'suis en d'or et platine
Tout est illégal, à 240 sur l'A7
J'me taille au Sénégal après t'avoir laissé par terre (Dadi)

Marseille, étoile légendaire sur le maillot
On met ton camp sur le banc, j'ai le col levé à la Cantona
Crois pas qu'la vie c'est un dream car, dehors, c'est marche ou crève
Moi, j'ai toujours la même team, j'fais toujours partie d'la crème
J'ai connu l'âge d'or du rap, quelques déceptions dans le hood
Moi, de la gloire, je m'en tape, avec les frères, on s'serre les coudesEmbed","31 Contributors13 Organisé Lyrics

This is a Nass production
Mmh, mmh
Merde alors

Tu veux la guerre, juste après, tu bipes ton père (ok)
À rien ça sert de faire pousser des affaires (gamberge)
Plus de mala, tu t'es retrouvé à terre (mala)
Maintenant, malade, tu grattes des blondes à l'after
Oh, oh (ouh), donne-nous le go, oh
On lâche pas le ghetto comme à Mexico (cabron)
Oh, oh (ouh), donne-nous le go, oh
On lâche pas le ghetto comme à Mexico (cabron)

Lunettes de ski dans le Rover, derrière les pecs, j'ai un grand cœur (piou)
Loin des traîtres, loin des pompeurs, tu fais le fou, après tu ramènes ton père (fiou, fiou, fiou)
Vingt projets après, j'ai les dents aiguisées, (oue, oue, oue) les schmitts ils ont des gros pet', des charbons déguisés (wouh, wouh)
Frérot, tu deviens chaud bizarre quand t'as tisé, (wouh) tu dis que tu tires, tu sais même pas viser (wouh)
J'suis dans des bails de malade, pas de mala, pas de cala, peu de câlins (rah, rah, rah)
Pas de calibre, une pensée aux frères pas libres, à ceux qui rêvent de palettes ou de conduire la Ferrari (wouh)
Pas b'soin de palettes au volant (non, non), j'suis dans la soucoupe volante (non)
Pas b'soin de palettes au volant (non), j'suis dans la soucoupe volante
Ça sent la beuh, fais vura, j'suis l'vingt-deux

Oh, j'suis carrément dans l'truc (han)
Carrément, trois By SFR, mec
C'est carrément les stup' (brr, brr), han, les p'tits sont dans Matrix, Opinel
On t'fait carrément du X, han, c'est que les frérots, que les numéros
Que la plata, que la pasta, sa grand-mère taffer au bureau, oh
Fer tchécoslovaque, boîtes de 30 arrivent sur l'Zodiac ('fack)
J'ai même pas bu d'Jack, bande organisée comme si t'avais vu l'Diable
Et sur les jantes, ça roule, Vovo j'rentre à la 'son, minable
7.65 près des couilles, ça bosse pas la zone abdominale

Ça tourne comme des civ' en automatique, tout niquer en équipe, c'est la thématique
Pour le territoire, entre ennemis, ça s'éradique, sous shit et alcool, t'es tarpin lunatique
J'entends le bruit du RR-1000, ça te cherche ça zone, outillé (outillé)
Dans le quartier, la guigne ça va plus vite qu'une Audi, eh (Audi, eh)
Il a acheté une Kalash' parce qu'on lui a dit : ""Pas besoin d'savoir viser"" (savoir viser)
À Marseille, à peine majeur, ça t'fait des RDC très organisé (organisé)

À l'aise, j'vais t'niquer ta mère et tu ne verras jamais l'iPhone 13
C'est nous la tess, déstresse, K-K-K.O.F.S
J'lui ai donné un faux nom, elle m'a donné un faux num', c'est une pute celle-là (hey)
Elle fait la pucelle, j'prends mes lovés, je me taille voir les putes à Bruxelles (wow)
Elle est plein de feinte, elle repart avec moi, elle est venue avec eux
Je la branche à 20 heures, je la nique à 22, j'ai allumé la lumière, en fait, elle était 'quinte

J'fume ma chicha en Fiat 500, en semaine, on est plein de flics, descentes
Bouge-toi de là que je mette l'essence, j'ai vidé mon carburant dans la piste de danse
Oui, ok, je vous pisse sur les dents, c'est ma façon de vous dire ""bonjour"" poliment
M'en bats les couilles qu'tu sois le meilleur, nous, on donne toujours l'meilleur
Ailleurs, on voit le néant, Marseille, c'est notre régiment

C'est moi le petit bâtard qui fait trembler cette putain d'ville (eh)
J'entends que des ragots, mais dis-moi, frérot, on flippe de qui, nous ? (eh)
Tu connais ma team (eh), la monnaie du shit qui nous active (eh)
Que des vantards, starfoullah, retiens-moi, j'vais faire une dinguerie
Viens voir dans ma ville, poursuites, braquages, bendo
Qué pasa bellissima, reste tranquille ou prends l'métro
C'est bête, elle me filoche (eh), appelle de phares dans l'rétro
Dans l'réseau depuis minot (eh), fais beleck à la Mondéo
Pour kichta, j'assassine, ça boit du Coca dans la bassine
Quand tu dors, on tartine, j'suis en d'or et platine
Tout est illégal, à 240 sur l'A7
J'me taille au Sénégal après t'avoir laissé par terre (Dadi)

Marseille, étoile légendaire sur le maillot
On met ton camp sur le banc, j'ai le col levé à la Cantona
Crois pas qu'la vie c'est un dream car, dehors, c'est marche ou crève
Moi, j'ai toujours la même team, j'fais toujours partie d'la crème
J'ai connu l'âge d'or du rap, quelques déceptions dans le hood
Moi, de la gloire, je m'en tape, avec les frères, on s'serre les coudesEmbed",en,"{'brillant', 'entre', 'vitesse', 'donné', 'poursuites', 'suffoque', 'belle', 'papy', 'guérilla', 'tokarev', 'veulent',

6,6,6,Ed Sheeran,Shape of You,"342 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçeEspañolPortuguêsΕλληνικάDeutschFrançaisShape of You Lyrics
A club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go (Mm)
Me and my friends at the table doin' shots
Drinkin' fast and then we talk slow (Mm)
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I'll give it a chance now (Mm)
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance and now I'm singin' like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, ""Boy, let's not talk too much""
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is fallin' too
I'm in love with your body
And last night, you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
Well, I'm in love with your body
You might also like
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Well, I'm in love with your body
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Well, I'm in love with your body
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Well, I'm in love with your body
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

One week in, we let the story begin
We're goin' out on our first date (Mm)
You and me are thrifty, so go all-you-can-eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate (Mm)
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doin' okay (Mm)
And leave and get in a taxi, and kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play and I'm singin' like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, ""Boy, let's not talk too much""
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is fallin' too
I'm in love with your body
And last night, you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
Well, I'm in love with your body

Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Well, I'm in love with your body
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Well, I'm in love with your body
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Well, I'm in love with your body
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is fallin' too
I'm in love with your body
And last night, you were in my room

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, ""Boy, let's not talk too much""
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm

We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is fallin' too

Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate (Mm)

And how your family is doin' okay (Mm)
And leave and get in a taxi, and kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play and I'm singin' like

Ay, ¡Fonsi! ¡D.Y.!
Ooh, oh, no, oh, no, oh
¡Hey, yeah!
Dididiri Daddy, go!
Sí, sabes que ya llevo un rato mirándote
Tengo que bailar contigo hoy (¡D.Y.!)
Vi que tu mirada ya estaba llamándome
Muéstrame el camino que yo voy

¡Oh!
Tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Sólo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso (¡Oh, yeah!)
Ya, ya me está gustando más de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro
Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmar las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
(Sube, sube, sube; sube, sube)

Quiero ver bailar tu pelo, quiero ser tu ritmo (Woh, eh)

Hasta provocar tus gritos (Woh, eh)
Y que olvides tu apellido (Rrr; D.Y.)

Si te pido un beso, ven, dámelo, yo sé que estás pensándolo (Eh)
Llevo tiempo intentándolo (Eh), mami, esto es dando y dándolo
Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bam-bam
Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bam-bam
Ven, prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe (Eh-eh; ¡plo!)
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empezamos lento, después salvaje

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamo' pegando, poquito a poquito
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamo' pegando, poquito a poquito (Oh-oh)
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas (No, no)
Pero pa' montarlo aquí tengo la pieza
¡Oye! (Yo', yo'; ¡plo!)
Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito (Yo')
Deja que te diga cosas al oído (Yo')
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo (Plo, plo)
Despacito (¡Plo!)
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito (Yeah-eh)
Firmar las paredes de tu laberinto

Hasta provocar tus gritos (Woh, eh)
Y que olvides tu apellido

Despacito
Vamo' a hacerlo en una playa en Puerto Rico
Hasta que las olas griten: ""¡Ay, Bendito!""
Para que mi sello se quede contigo
¡Báilalo!
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito (Oh, yeah-yeah)
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito (No, no; oh)

Oh, Fonsi! D.Y.!
Ooh, oh, no, oh, no, oh
Hey yeah!
Dididiri Daddy, go!
Yes, you know that I've been looking at you for a while
I have to dance with you today (D.Y.!)
I saw that your look was already calling me
Show me the way that I'm going

Oh!
You, you are the magnet and I am the metal
I am getting closer and I am putting together the plan
Just thinking about it makes your pulse race (Oh, yeah!)
Yeah, I'm liking it more than usual
All my senses are asking for more
This must be taken without any rush
Slowly
I want to breathe your neck slowly
Let me tell you things in my ear
So that you remember if you are not with me
Slowly
I want to undress you with kisses slowly
Sign the walls of your maze
And make your body a whole manuscript

And forget your last name (Rrr; D.Y.)

If I ask you for a kiss, come, give it to me, I know you're thinking about it (Eh)
I've been trying for a while (Eh), mommy, this is giving and giving it
You know that your heart with me makes you bam-bam
You know that that baby is looking for my bam-bam
Come, taste my mouth to see how she tastes you (Eh-eh; plo!)
I want, I want, I want to see how much love fits you
I'm not in a hurry, I want to take the trip
We started slow, then wild

Step by step, soft, soft
We're going to hit each other, little by little
When you kiss me with that skill
I see that you are malice with delicacy
Step by step, soft, soft
We're going to hit each other, little by little (Oh-oh)
And that beauty is a puzzle (No, no)
But to assemble it here I have the piece

Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me

So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know ﻿I was lost


I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
I hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game﻿ made for everyone
And love is the prize

Hun ba han å te seg, for i kveld var de med fintfolk
Snakk om vær og vind for det har substans
Han var en jævel te å skru bil, det hadd'n styr på
Men han hører ikke forskjell på gresk og finans
Han kommer fra et helt annet miljø
Det er oljesøl og raggen måste gå
Hun er fra en finere familie
At han er rægger, kan de aldri få vite om

Han har den fineste Chevy'n i hele dalen
Nå sitter'n drita full i eget flak
Skulle aldri kjørt, skulle hatt sjåfør
Så på bunn av denne sjøen
Ligger den fineste Chevy'n i hele dalen

Han er god som gull men aldri hatt ei krone
Han er fornøyd om han har penger til bensin
Jeg har fortalt til nær og kjær at han går på skole
Og jeg har handla klær, for i kveld må'n kle seg fint

Han har den fineste Chevy'n i hele dalen
Nå sitter'n drita full i eget flak
Skulle aldri kjørt, burde hatt sjåfør

She asked him to calm down, because tonight they were with nice people
Talk about weather and wind because it has substance
He was a damn tea to screw up a car, he had a handle on it
But he doesn't hear the difference between Greek and finance
He comes from a completely different environment
There is an oil spill and the rag has to go
She is from a nicer family
They can never find out that he is gay

He has the nicest Chevy in the whole valley
Now he's sitting full in his own flake
Should never have driven, should have had a driver
So at the bottom of this lake
Located the finest Chevy in the entire valley

He is as good as gold but has never had a crown
He is happy if he has money for petrol
I have told my near and dear ones that he goes to school
And I've bought clothes, because tonight you have to dress nicely

He has the nicest Chevy in the whole valley
Now he's sitting full in his own flake

I look up from the ground
To see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me
And I see there's something you're trying to hide
And I reach for your hand but it's cold
You pull away again
And I wonder what's on your mind
And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble and your voice begins to break
You say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's
They were my mate's
And I feel the colour draining from my face

And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be alright""

So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent
And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head
And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone
And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on
But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
But I just wanna stay

I sail through waves and storms
The spark in life feels enormous
As long as I live I'm in shape
Because I'm just jovial
I break off the chains and become free
I can't let it pass
I feel lost
No matter what they say, I will make it happen

I don't need a boat, money and cars
Don't go with the flow, I don't have time for that
Live here and now, Live rather mad

Things you should turn for the better
Negativity is an enemy

Tank God
Ayy, ayy

I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (Star, ayy, ayy)
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta ('Sta)
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, them the shottas ('Tas)
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grrra-ta-ta-ta (Ta, pow, pow, pow, ayy, ayy)

Switch my whip, came back in black
I'm startin' sayin', ""Rest in peace to Bon Scott"" (Scott, ayy)
Close that door, we blowin' smoke
She ask me light a fire like I'm Morrison ('Son, ayy)
Act a fool on stage
Prolly leave my fuckin' show in a cop car (Car, ayy)
Shit was legendary
Threw a TV out the window of the Montage
Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn
Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryna get in
Sayin', ""I'm with the band"" (Ayy, ayy)
Now she actin' outta pocket, tryna grab up on my pants
Hundred bitches in my trailer say they ain't got a man
And they all brought a friend (Yeah, ayy, ayy, ayy)

I've been in the Hills fuckin' superstars
Feelin' like a popstar (21, 21, 21)
Drankin' Henny, bad bitches jumpin' in the pool
And they ain't got on no bra (Bra)
Hit her from the back, pullin' on her tracks
And now she screamin' out, ""¡No más!"" (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
They like, ""Savage, why you got a 12 car garage
And you only got six cars?"" (21)
I ain't with the cakin', how you kiss that? (Kiss that?)
Your wifey say I'm lookin' like a whole snack (Big snack)
Green hundreds in my safe, I got old racks (Old racks)
L.A. bitches always askin', ""Where the coke at?"" (21, 21)
Livin' like a rockstar, smash out on a cop car
Sweeter than a Pop-Tart, you know you are not hard
I done made the hot chart, 'member I used to trap hard

Well, you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go

Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
You might also like
Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep

Well, you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go, oh, woah, oh, oh

Du løfta meg opp
Eg komme aldri te å glømma det
Du gjørr livet mitt godt
Det' ingen vits å takka Gud for det
Og når dagen e grå
Så male du himmelen blå
Og når eg tabbe meg ud
Så klare du alltid å få ting te å snu

Hadde alle her i verden vært som deg
Hadde ting vært bra
Det e sånne sånn så deg
Denne kloden burde ha

Eg seie bare så du vett det
Eg har så sinnsykt sans for deg
Du e engel, du e god som gull
Ja, bare så du vett det

You lifted me up
I will never forget it
You make my life good
There's no point in thanking God for that
And when the day is gray
So you paint the sky blue
And when I get lost
So you always manage to turn things around

If only everyone in the world were like you
Had things been good
It's like that like you
This globe should have

I'm just saying so you know
I have such crazy feelings for you
You are an angel, you are good as gold
Yes, just so you know

No, you never give up
I am insanely grateful for that
And when I think you've had enough
I still have tea to live with
You are so delicious and beautiful
Can thank your mother and father for that
And when I lose heart
Then you always make me laugh

You are an angel, you are good as gold
Yes, just so you know
But the fuck can I say that?
Because I love you, I love you
But there's one thing I wonder about

Careful what you say
This time of year tends to weaken me
And have a little decency
And let me cry in peace
But there's a place where I
Erase the challenges I've been through
Where I know every corner
Every street name all by heart

And so it is a part of my
Courageous plan to leave
With a broken heart
Tucked away under my sleeve

I wanna go home for Christmas
Let me go home this year
I wanna go home for Christmas
Let me go home this year

I'll pack my bags and leave
Before the sun rises tomorrow
'Cause we act more like strangers
For each day that I am here
But I have people close to me
Who never will desert me
Who remind me frequently
What I was like as a child

Or who I'll choose to love me

When you called up my phone
I was all alone
Voice close to my ear
Like the sound of a song
You said ""Let's take a ride""
This was late July
We got lost in the night
(We got lost in the night)
So we drove around town
In your beat-up car
Soft sounds of your breath
And the sound of my heart

Don’t remember the words
I know how I felt
Is this trouble again?

I never felt like this with somebody
I never thought I'd feel like I do
I never felt this close with somebody
Somebody, somebody but you
I never had this rush in my body
I never thought I'd feel somethin’ new
I never felt this close with somebody
Somebody, somebody but you

Something 'bout you and the way we fit

Heat of you on my skin

From the second we met, I knew things would change

Ah, ah-ah
Ooh-woah
Oh-oh

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do you recognise me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
""Happy Christmas,"" I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying, ""I love you,"" I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face of a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover, but you tore me apart

Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again

Thought I found a way
Thought I found a way out (Found)
But you never go away (Never go away)
So I guess I gotta stay now

Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear

Isn't it lovely, all alone?
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home

Walking out of time
Looking for a better place (Looking for a better place)
Something's on my mind
Always in my head space

But I know someday I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years

I had a dream
We were sipping whiskey neat
Highest floor, The Bowery
And I was high enough
Somewhere along the lines
We stopped seeing eye to eye
You were staying out all night
And I had enough

No, I don't wanna know
Where you been or where you're goin'
But I know I won't be home
And you'll be on your own

(På roser)
(For deg)

Jeg ser du kunne hatt det litt bedre
Jeg vet du har det vondt
Du slipper ingen inn på deg
Små føtter i et iskaldt hav
Med hodet under vann
Og later som om alt er greit

Elska av de andre men du elska ikke den du var
For gutten inni bildet klarte aldri å finne gode svar

De sa du dansa på roser
De sa du aldri trår feil
Men det var en ting du savna
Det var smilet i ditt eget speil
Stupe i havet
Var frihet for deg
Under vann for å skrike
Så ingen kunne høre deg

For gutten inni bildet klarte aldri å finne gode svar

De sa du dansa på roser
De sa du aldri trår feil
Men det var en ting du savna
Det var smilet i ditt eget speil

(On roses)
(For you)

I see you could have done a little better
I know you are in pain
You don't let anyone in on you
Little feet in an icy sea
With the head under water
And pretend everything is ok

Love by the others but you don't love who you were
Because the boy in the picture was never able to find good answers

They said you dance on roses
They said you are never wrong
But there was one thing you missed
It was the smile in your own mirror
Plunge into the sea
Was freedom for you
Under water to scream
So no one could hear you
You might also like
Throw away the mask, you are allowed to cry
You should have spoken up
But know that it is easy to say
Don't listen to all the voices in your head
Which says you are weak
It's okay to have a hard time

Loved by others but you don't love who you were
Because the boy in the picture was never able to find good answers

They said you dance on roses
They said you are never wrong
But there was one thing you missed
It was the smile in your own mirror
Plunge into the sea
Was freedom for you
Under water to scream
So no one could hear you
They said you dance on roses
Stepping wrong
You missed
The smile in your own mirror
Plunge into the sea
Was freedom for you
Under water to scream
So no one could hear you

They said I never make mistakes

Og arret ble til et minne om tinga vi føkker opp

I zone out
Can you just tell me the same thing as always?
It's the same if you lie and take it back
A halo, you get again

There was no one around town who wanted to be like us
Suddenly we realized we had to learn to fight
The blood flowed like a waterfall from just above the eyelid
And the scar became a memory of the things we raise
You said you told me, presumably
I don't always manage to take it
Sometimes I think that the most dangerous things that exist are all the things that everyone says don't exist

Because time is just numbers and we are just dust
And if you want to become an angel, you should do it before you die
I tried, I tried
But I'm not like you

I zone out
Can you just tell me the same thing as always?
It's the same if you lie and take it back

So where are you?
Can you just join the flames like before?

And the bottles went wall to wall until you had to be carried out
You should have been an honest dude and told me I looked too damn good
Now what I hit burst into the atmosphere like a shooting star
But dear, dear God, I just wanted to be cool
And thought it was love to just let you be broken
So there were two of us sniffing the most dangerous thing there is
All the things everyone says don't exist

Because time is just numbers and we are just dust
And if you want to become an angel, you should do it before you die
I tried, I tried
But I'm not like you

So where are you?
Can you take the call and we'll go somewhere else?
Just need something that doesn't change
So where are you? Where are you?

My lover's got humour
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
They should've worshipped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's gettin' more bleak
A fresh poison each week
""We were born sick""
You heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well

A-a-a-a-a-a-a, amen, amen, amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life

What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starvin' faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life
No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then, I am human
Only then, I am clean

Oh, oh, amen, amen, amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death

My lover's got humour
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
They should've worshipped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's gettin' more bleak
A fresh poison each week
""We were born sick""
You heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well

A-a-a-a-a-a-a, amen, amen, amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life

If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea
Get somethin' shiny
Somethin' meaty for the main course
That's a fine lookin' high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starvin' faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

Take me to church

I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife

Eg snublet omkring i svarteste natten
Da tente du stjernen med lys ifra deg
Eg følte meg ensom og tom og forlatt
Da du viste du tenkte på meg

Eg hutret og frøys da du gav meg din varme
Du så vel at jorden var naken og kald
Du lengtet til meg, og du sendte meg barnet
Og viste meg vei til en stall

Himmel på jord
En glede så stor
Eg e'kje alene
Her eg bor
Himmel på jord
En nåde så stor
Eg e'kje alene
Her eg bor

Eg sloss og jeg led, gjorde alt for å vinne
Da hørte eg englene synge om fred
Legg våpnene ned, det er jul du må finne
En fred inni hjertet et sted

I stumbled about in the blackest night
Then you lit the star with light from you
I felt lonely and empty and abandoned
When you showed you thought of me

I shivered and froze when you gave me your warmth
You saw that the earth was bare and cold
You longed for me, and you sent me the child
And showed me the way to a stable

Heaven on earth
Such a joy
I'm not alone
Here I live
Heaven on earth
A grace so great
I'm not alone
Here I live

I fought and I suffered, I did everything to win
Then I heard the angels sing of peace
Put down your weapons, it's Christmas you have to find
A peace inside the heart somewhere

33,33,33,Ed Sheeran,I See Fire,"84 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçeI See Fire Lyrics
Oh, misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons

If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Callin' out, Father, oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside high

And if we should die tonight, we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Callin' out, Father, oh, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
Desolation comes upon the sky

Now, I see fire inside the mountain
I see fire burnin' the trees
And I see fire hollowin' souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you'll remember me
You might also like
Oh, should my people fall then surely, I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls, we got too close to the flame
Callin' out, Father, oh, hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
Desolation comes upon the sky

Now, I see fire inside the mountain
I see fire burnin' the trees
And I see fire hollowin' souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you'll remember me

And if the night is burning, I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns, then my brothers will die
And as the sky's fallin' down, it crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground, I hear my people screamin' out

Now, I see fire inside the mountains
I see fire burnin' the trees
I see fire hollowin' souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
I see fire (Oh, you know I saw a city burnin' out)
And I see fire (Feel the heat upon my skin)
And I see fire
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountain side262Embed","84 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçeI See Fire Lyrics

34,34,34,James Arthur,Say You Won't Let Go,"149 ContributorsTranslationsΕλληνικάTürkçePortuguêsDeutschBahasa IndonesiaSay You Won’t Let Go Lyrics
I met you in the dark, you lit me up
You made me feel as though I was enough
We danced the night away, we drank too much
I held your hair back when you were throwin' up

Then, you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, ""I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest""

I knew I loved you then, but you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you, but I never showed
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school, wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night
You might also like
When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, woah
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that every day, you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you and I hope you know
Darlin', your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far, my dear, look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me when I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till my lungs give out
I promise till death we part, like in our vows
So, I wrote this song for you, now everybody knows
That it's just you and me till we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go
Oh, just say you won't let go153Embed","149 ContributorsTranslationsΕλληνικάTürkçePortuguêsDeutschBahasa IndonesiaSay You Won’t Let Go Lyrics

Don't you know I'm no good for you?
I've learned to lose you, can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
But nothin' ever stops you leavin'

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

Don't you know too much already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend, but keep me closer (Call me back)
And I'll call you when the party's over

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

But nothin' is better sometimes
Once we've both said our goodbyes

For vi lever for å dø
Til vi smelter bort som snø
Og de ser etter feil
Men jeg flipper finger'n
For jeg lager min vei
Når alle ber deg stoppe opp
Glem det og fokuser og jobb
For sjalusien, den brenner
Skjønt at mange broer må brenne
Så alle e'kke venner

Fy faen, fy, fy faen
Alle de er snakes, så det er helt normalt

Because we live to die
Until we melt away like snow
And they look for mistakes
But I flip my finger
Because I make my way
When everyone tells you to stop
Forget it and focus and work
For jealousy, it burns
Although many bridges must burn
So everyone isn't friends

Fuck, fuck, fuck
All of them are snakes, so it's completely normal
Fuck, fuck, fuck
Nobody here has time for a failed day
Fuck, fuck, fuck
Everyone gives me a headache now and then

Never sold a bag but look like Pablo in a photo

Turn up baby, turn up, when I turn it on
You know how I get too lit when I turn it on
Can't handle my behavior when I turn it on
Too fast, never ask, if the life don't last
Done been through it all
Fuck with a nigga raw, this who you wanna be
And I know you won't tell nobody nothing
And I know you won't tell nobody no

Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look at the five and ten
It's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

A pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

I'm a flame, you're a fire
I'm the dark in need of light
When we touch, you inspire
Feel it changin' me tonight
Take me up, take me higher
There's a world not far from here
We can dance in desire
Or we can burn in love tonight

Our hearts are like firestones
And when they strike, we feel the love
Sparks will fly, they ignite our bones
And when they strike, we light up the world

Er det fakler hele veien som i fjor
Kjenner lufta bærer røkelse og svor
For ingen lager ribbe som a mor
Og på peisen har vi alle hver vår sokk
Det er jul igjen og aldri får jeg nok
Og Maria det du gjorde gjør meg godt
Takk gud for at du ikke tok abort
Det går elv, hundre gavekort og fluestang
Henda fulle, akevitt og julesang
Nisse, Lue, Ipad, og rettetang

Også synger vi
Hey ho, det tramper oppå taket
Hey ho, nissen er tilbake
Hey ho, det er gaver under grana
Hey ho, og tomtegløgg i krana

Are there torches all the way like last year
Knows the air carries incense and oaths
Because no one makes ribs like a mother
And on the fireplace we all have our own sock
It's Christmas again and I can never get enough
And Maria, what you did makes me feel good
Thank God you didn't have an abortion
There is a river, a hundred gift cards and a fly rod
Hands full, aquavit and carols

Hey ho, Santa is back
Hey ho, there are presents under the tree

I took a pill in Ibiza to show Avicii I was cool
And when I finally got sober, felt 10 years older
But fuck it, it was something to do
I'm living out in LA, I drive a sports car just to prove
I'm a real big baller 'cause I made a million dollars
And I spend it on girls and shoes
But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster
And be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs

I'm just a singer who already blew his shot
I get along with old timers
'Cause my name's a reminder of a pop song people forgot
And I can't keep a girl, no
'Cause as soon as the sun comes up
I cut 'em all loose and work's my excuse
But the truth is I can't open up

I brought my pride and my guitar

And the people still think I'm a star
I walked around downtown
I met some fans on Lafayette
They said tell us how to make it 'cause we're getting real impatient
So I looked 'em in the eye and said

I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, but I was just kidding myself
Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone, all I hear are the words that I needed to say

When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal, but this won't

So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'da known you had a storm to weather
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So before you go

Was never the right time whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all

When you could be blowin' up just like my cellular?
I won't ever let a shorty go and set me up
Only thing I need to know is if you wet enough
I'm talkin' slick back, kick back, gang sippin' forties
You keep playin', not another day with you, shorty
Mismatched fits, that was way before you know me
Got a lot of love, well, you better save it for me
We play games of love to avoid the depression
We been here before and I won't be a victim

Why you always in a mood?
Fuckin' 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do
But try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playin' by your rules
Everything look better with a view

I know you so well, so well
I mean, I can do anything that he can
I've been pretty—

I know you're somewhere, somewhere
I've been trapped in my mind, girl, just holding on
I don't wanna pretend we're something, we're nothing
I've been stuck thinking 'bout her, I can't hold on (I'll be feeling)

I'm in pain, wanna put ten shots in my brain
I've been trippin' 'bout some things, can't change
Suicidal, same time I'm tame
Picture this, in bed, get a phone call
Girl that you fucked with killed herself
That was this summer when nobody helped
And ever since then, man, I hate myself
Wanna fuckin' end it, pessimistic
All wanna see me with no pot to piss in
But niggas been excited 'bout the grave I'm diggin'
Havin' conversations 'bout my haste decisions
Fuckin' sickenin'; at the same time
Memories surface through the grapevine
'Bout my uncle playin' with a slip knot
Post-traumatic stress got me fucked up
Been fucked up since the couple months they had a nigga locked up

When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?

And darling, I will be loving you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinking 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So honey, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same

Nå blir det flomvarsel her altså

Nå som fotballkarriæra mi er død
Kan jeg endelig få båten min på sjøen
Motoren gikk til helvete i Kragerø
Men alt kan repareres (Hey!)
Svir i stykker pølser på engangsgrill
Ikke mere trening, jeg tar det helt chill
Skal jeg få sommerkroppen som jeg vil
Så må jeg opereres

De har en klinikk for meg på Majorstua
De fikser meg så utrolig bra
Du kan stikke og trene noe squats
Jeg skal opereres (Hey!)

Sol, øl, smiler til kamera
Loff, smør, chillern og slapper av
Lever som aldri før
Gidder ikke trene, når jeg kan operere
Sol, øl, smiler til kamera
Loff, smør, chillern og slapper av
Lever som aldri før
Gidder ikke trene, når jeg kan operere (Det her er livet)

Now there will be a flood warning here

Now that my football career is dead
Can I finally get my boat on the lake?
The engine went to hell in Kragerø
But everything can be repaired (Hey!)
Slice sausages on a disposable grill
No more training, I'm taking it easy
Should I get the summer body I want?
Then I have to have surgery

They have a clinic for me at Majorstua
They fix me so incredibly well
You can squat and do some squats
I'm going to have surgery (Hey!)

Sun, beer, smiling for the camera
Loaf, spread, chill and relax
Live like never before
Can't be bothered to train when I can operate
Sun, beer, smiling for the camera
Loaf, spread, chill and relax
Live like never before
Don't bother working out, when I can operate (This is life)

Enjoying myself on the beach with cigars and snuff
Washes down some snot with a liter of soda
My jaw is yellow and it looks dry
But the teeth can be whitened (Discount code: 20 percent)
I have orange skin and a wrinkled face
Then top up with Botox every now and then
Started losing hair, but same
Everything can be transplanted

They have a clinic for me at Majorstua
They fix me so incredibly well
You can squat and do some squats
I'm going to have surgery (Hey!)

Sun, beer, smiling for the camera
Loaf, spread, chill and relax
Live like never before
Can't be bothered to train when I can operate
Sun, beer, smiling for the camera
Loaf, spread, chill and relax
Live like never before
Can't be bothered to train when I can operate
Imagine that I've been struggling with strength training and intervals for so many years
Yes, you look like a completely different person now
You don't look like yourself anymore
Thanks (Sure!)

Sun, beer, smiling for the camera
Loaf, spread, chill and relax
Live like never before
Can't be bothered to train when I can operate

Ey yo
Jeg er med en homie i Toscana og fyrer lange
Vi drar og handler etter flyet vårt lander
Haʼkke vært noe annet enn det var for fire år sia
Pushеr album hele jævla årstida
Jeg har vært på stranda mеd Pus helt siden morninga
Så digg at alle på mitt lag er så målretta
Ballinga strekker til Firenze helt fra Vålerenga
Vi kan se Italia, bror
Ta toget fra Napoli helt til Milano
Vi kan se Sicilia søster, dunke vin og østers når vi bryter brød
Jeg kan ta deg med til Vatikanstaten
Hvis du ser opp i taket så ser du skapelsen
Vi kan sette oss ved vannkanten
Ta en jubby i sola oss to, for

Hvis du har en drøm og kan fantasere

Hvis du setter deg mål, da er sjansen større
Det er ikke flaks, men klare tanker som styrer deg

Livet er et spill, alt skal passe inn
Du må lære deg å tolke rollen din
Nå drar du din vei, men jeg glemmer deg aldri

Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control

Grips on your waist, front way, back way

Even when I'm away

There's never much love when we go OT

I know you moved onto someone new
Hope life is beautiful
You were the light for me to find my truth
I just wanna say, thank you

Leaving to find my soul
Told her I had to go
And I know it ain't pretty
When our hearts get broke
Too young to feel this old
Watching us both turn cold
Oh, I know it ain't pretty
When two hearts get broke
Yeah, I know it ain't pretty
When two hearts get broke

I hope someday we'll sit down together
And laugh with each other about these days, these days
All our troubles, we'll lay to rest and
We'll wish we could come back to these days, these days

Reminiscing on those past days
I thought you’d end up with my last name
But that changed
And I travelled around the world
Think where you living at now?
I heard you moved to Austin
Got an apartment and settled down
And every once in a while, I start texting
Write a paragraph, but then I delete the message
Think about you like a past time
I could cry you a river, get you baptized or
I wasn't ready to act right
Used to always think I'd get you back, right
They say that things fall apart
We were gonna move to Brooklyn
You were gonna study art
Love is just a tool
To remind us who we are
And that we are not alone
When we're walking in the dark

Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook at me, feelin' me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

Pain! You made me a, you made me a

Pain! You break me down, you build me up
Believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain

Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard
Has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh

I was chokin' in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like…

Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?

Hello, sweet grief
I know you'll be the death of me
Feel like the mornin' after ecstasy
I am drownin' in an endless sea
Hello, old friend
Here's the misery that knows no end
So I'm doin' everything I can
To make sure I never love again

I wish that I did not know
Where all broken lovers go
I wish that my heart was made of stone
Yeah, if I was bulletproof (Yeah)
I'd love you black and blue (Blue)
If I was solid like a jewel

If I had a diamond heart, oh-oh
I'd give you all my love
If I was unbreakable
If I had a diamond heart, oh-oh
You could shoot me with a gun of gold
If I was unbreakable

Blue-eyed and foolish, never mind the bruises
Into the fire, breakin' through the wires
Give you all I've got (If I had a diamond heart)

Diamonds don't shatter, beautiful and battered
Into the poison, cry you an ocean
Give you all I've got

Goodbye, so long
I don't know if this is right or wrong
Am I givin' up where I belong?
'Cause every station's playin' our song
Goodbye, my love
You are everything my dreams made up

You think you can just take it back, but shit just don't work like that

Guess I'm stuck with you, and that's that

'Cause when it all falls down, then whatever

Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now

I did not believe that it would end, no
Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head

Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like

Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?

And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand new girl (Girl)

Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Well, good for you, I guess you're gettin' everything you want (Ah)
You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off (Ah)

Baby, what the fuck is up with that? (Ah)

Why, why when I know the good you do to me
It can almost seem like I'm trying to avoid it
And I feel afraid of the grace and joy you bestow on me
Wonderful, wonderful

There is a well, a source of life in my own space
Love is the name and the gaze becomes clear at the smallest glass
And every time I dare to drink from it, I become whole and clean
And I feel a twinkling light go through my marrow and bones

I'm wondering
Why don't I go for it more?
Why, why when I know the good you do to me
It can almost seem like I'm trying to avoid it
And I feel afraid of the grace and joy you bestow on me
Wonderful, wonderful

I will defy my resistance to accepting what is good
It's not a good idea to go around looking for what I've already got
Oh, oh, oh, oh

It can almost seem like I'm trying to avoid it

80,80,80,Lukas Graham,7 Years,"226 ContributorsTranslationsΕλληνικά7 Years Lyrics
Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me
""Go make yourself some friends, or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was seven years old

It was a big, big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven, smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich, so we were out to make that steady figure

Once, I was eleven years old, my daddy told me
""Go get yourself a wife, or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was eleven years old

I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once, I was twenty years old (Lukas Graham!)
You might also like
I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me, at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later
Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
I was writing 'bout everything I saw before me
Once, I was twenty years old

Soon, we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon, we'll be thirty years old

I'm still learning about life, my woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs, and I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me, some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind, my brother, I'm still sorry

Soon, I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month
Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold?
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
Soon, I'll be sixty years old
Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold?
Or will I have a lot of children who can hold me?

You broke me first

Maybe you don't like talking too much about yourself
But you shoulda told me that you were thinking 'bout someone else
You're drunk at a party or maybe it's just that your car broke down
Your phone's been off for a couple of months, so you're calling me now
I know you, you're like this
When shit don't go your way, you needed me to fix it
And like me, I did
But I ran out of every reason

Now suddenly, you're asking for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first
You broke me first

Took a while, was in denial when I first heard
That you moved on quicker than I could've ever, you know that hurt
Swear for a while, I would stare at my phone just to see your name

I'm a big girl, baby
Now why you acting so shady lately?
You don't need to babysit me
Arigato, later dude
Gotta find another you, yeah someone new
I'm about to steal a car
On my way to a random bar
I'm a Columbus, 'cause he went too far
I'm a big girl baby
Don't protect me from the big world, baby

Oh, what you trying to protect me from?
I'm just 'tryna have some fun
But when we wake in the morning, stuck in a corner
Oh, just tell me why I have to stay
I don't really like to play it safe
Arigato motherfucker
So arigato, later

I'm a big shot baby
You can't handle my outbursts, you see
Gotta let me go crazy, baby
Arigato, what's the use
Everything you got to lose, is me and you
You might also likeAll I wanna do is run
Wanna see who I become?
I'm not a housewife, never will be one
I'm a big shot baby
I'm the one who makes the big bucks baby

Oh, what you trying to protect me from?
I'm just 'tryna have some fun
But when we wake in the morning, stuck in a corner
Oh, just tell me why I have to stay
I don't really like to play it safe

I was distracted and in traffic
I didn't feel it when the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin', were you out drinkin'?
Were you in the living room, chillin', watchin' television?
It's been a year now, think I've figured out how
How to let you go and let communication die out

I know, you know, we know you weren't
Down for forever and it's fine
I know, you know, we know we weren't
Meant for each other and it's fine

But if the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it?
All our fears would be irrelevant
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
The sky'd be falling and I'd hold you tight
And there wouldn't be a reason why
We would even have to say goodbye
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right? Right?
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right? Right?

I tried to imagine your reaction
It didn't scare me when the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin', the night we went drinkin'
Stumbled in the house and didn't make it past the kitchen
Ah, it's been a year now, think I've figured out how
How to think about you without it rippin' my heart out

And I know, you know, we know you weren't
Down for forever and it's fine
I know, you know, we know we weren't
Meant for each other and it's fine

But if the world was ending, you'd come over, right?

Bought Mama a crib and a brand new wagon

Girls get loose when they hear this song
A hundred on the dash get me close to God
We don't pray for love, we just pray for cars

Milli point two just to hurt you, ah
All red Lamb' just to tease you, ah
None of these toys on lease too, ah
Made your whole year in a week too, yah
Main bitch outta your league too, ah
Side bitch outta your league too, ah
House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table, cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby, ah
You talkin' money, need a hearin' aid
You talkin' 'bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain

Bought Mama a crib and a brand new wagon

Star Trek roof in that Wraith of Khan
Girls get loose when they hear this song
A hundred on the dash get me close to God

Je pense aux quatre sorties de pot, j'pense aux quatre roues directrices
Toute ton équipe se demande : ""What the fuck ? Mais qui est ce type ?""

Glock sous ceinture Hermès pour les fumer tout en ayant du style
Tu tapes des impros dans les kermesses pendant que je suis en showcase au Crystal
Si tu veux m'faire faut pas t'louper
Je reviens du ciel, les étoiles entres elles, ne parlent que de mes derniers couplets
¡ Hola chica ! Pam-pam-pam-pam
J'veux être blindé comme les chichas les soirs d'ram'dam-dam
J'dis pas que vos mères sont qu'une bande de putes
J'dis juste que quand elles m'matent elles ont les yeux qui sentent le uc'

O la la, nå er vi her
Nye skirenn og snø på alle trær
Det daler snøfiller
Stemning på topp med raske briller
Vi går med lue, og sekk og et flagg
Sunn norsk ungdom har på riktig plagg
Vi titter bort på våre venner
Smilet går rundt for det er friluft som gjelder

Heia heia, heia heia heia
Heia, heia heia hele greia
Men det er fort å gå litt lei
Når den samme jævla svensken passerer deg
Scenen er dekket for glitter og stas
Men det opplegget her mangler stemning og fjas
Vi legger emnet litt på hylla
For skifest betyr tid for fylla

Å, o la la

O la la, now we are here
New ski slopes and snow on all trees
Snowflakes are falling
Atmosphere at its peak with fast glasses
We go with a hat, and a bag and a flag
Healthy Norwegian youth wear the right clothes
We look away from our friends
The smile goes around because it is the open air that applies

Hey hey, hey hey hey
Hey, hey hey the whole thing
But it's easy to get a little bored
When the same damn Swede passes you
The stage is covered in glitter and pomp
But the arrangement here lacks atmosphere and flair
We put the topic on the shelf for a bit
For a ski party, it means time to get drunk

Oh, oh la la

Without it, life is wasted time
Look inside your heart, and I'll look inside mine

Falling behind in what could be, oh

Where's that higher love I keep thinking of?

Never felt a feeling of comfort, oh

Love only left me alone
But I'm at one with the silence

I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one and I've been quiet for too long

I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today, I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around

And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs

Counting days, counting days
Since my love up and got lost on me
And every breath that I've been taking
Since you left feels like a waste on me
I've been holding on to hope
That you'll come back when you can find some peace
'Cause every word that I've heard spoken
Since you left feels like a hollow street

I've been told, I've been told to get you off my mind
But I hope I never lose the bruises that you left behind
Oh my lord, oh my lord, I need you by my side

There must be something in the water
'Cause every day, it's getting colder
And if only I could hold you
You'd keep my head from going under

Maybe I, maybe I'm just being blinded
By the brighter side
Of what we had because it's over
Well, there must be something in the tide

Full of pain, dropped enough tears to fill up a fuckin' bucket
Goin' for buckets, I bought a chopper
I got a big drum, it hold a hundred, ain't goin' for nothin'
I'm ready to air it out on all these niggas, I can see 'em runnin'
Just talked to my mama, she hit me on FaceTime just to check up on me and my brother
I'm really the baby, she know that her youngest son was always guaranteed to get the money (Okay, let's go)
She know that her baby boy was always guaranteed to get the loot
She know what I do, she know 'fore I run from a nigga, I'ma pull it out and shoot (Boom)

And I'll kill another nigga too

100,100,100,Cezinando,Håper du har plass,"21 ContributorsHåper Du Har Plass Lyrics
Det er ingenting som fenger lenger eller føles ut som en ekte følelse
Og det har nettopp begynt å øse ned
Så jeg håper du har plass, jeg håper du har plass til meg igjen
Om så bare en madrass som kan ligge inne på dass for min del
Jeg håper jeg får pass inn i ditt palass
Jeg kan roe meg og liste meg som om jeg gikk på glass
Jeg håper det er plass til meg et sted inne i hjertet som du arvet av din mor og meg

Jeg håper du har plass, jeg håper du har plass
Jeg kommer helt alene og ikke med noe lass
Du kan si når jeg må skjerpe meg og sette meg på plass hvis du finner et vindu til meg
Omfang meg når jeg faller eller mister meg selv og siste flammen eller gnisten
Jeg skal la deg gråte ferdig for et liv på min bekostning hvis du finner et vindu til meg

Jeg kommer hjem igjen
Hva enn som var hjemme igjen
Jeg kan'ke dra til henne igjen
Det er min skyld at det er endevendt
Så hun har ting som koker nedi kjelleren som noe hjemmebrent
Og jeg har ting i skapet og i permen
Lar det ringe to ganger før jeg legger på, så du må ringe opp og jeg ser navnet ditt på skjermen
Med et bilde av deg

Jeg skal la deg gråte ferdig for et liv på min bekostning hvis du finner et vindu til meg

Jeg har sovet ute før
Da var jeg nærmere den ekte meg
Den langt ifra den perfekte litt defekte meg
Trodde det var Jesus når de vekte meg, men jeg er lett å lure
Hele livet har hele verden vært på meg
Så jeg ga opp å få de til å forstå meg
Jeg kan lage middag, det er det samme for meg
Hva med frossen pytt-i-panne?

There is nothing that captures anymore or feels like a real emotion
And it has just started pouring down
So I hope you have room, I hope you have room for me again
If only a mattress that can lie inside the dass for me
I hope I get a pass into your palace
I can calm down and list myself as if I were walking on glass
I hope there is room for me somewhere in your heart that you inherited from your mother and me

I hope you have room, I hope you have room
I come all alone and with no load
You can tell when I need to toughen up and settle down if you find a window for me
Embrace me when I fall or lose myself and the last flame or spark
I'll let you cry for a living at my expense if you find a window for me

I'm coming home again
Whatever was back home
I can't go to her again
It's my fault that it's upside down
So she has things boiling down in the basement like something burnt at home
And I have things in the cupboard and in the binder
Lets it ring twice before I hang up so you have to call and I see your name on the screen
With a picture of you

Embrace me when I fall or lose myself and the last flame or spark
I'll let you cry for a living at my expense if you find a window for me

I've slept outside before
Then I was closer to the real me
The far from perfect slightly flawed me
Thought it was Jesus when they weighed me, but I'm easily fooled
All my life, the whole world has been on me
So I gave up trying to make them understand me
I can cook dinner, it's the same for me
How about frozen puddle-in-the-pan?

I hope you have room, I hope you have room
I come all alone and with no load
You can tell when I need to toughen up and settle down if you find a window for me
Embrace me when I fall or lose myself and the last flame or spark
I'll let you cry for a living at my expense if you find a window for me

There is nothing that captures anymore or feels like a real emotion
And it has just started pouring down
So I hope you have room, I hope you have room

My face above the water
My feet can't touch the ground
Touch the ground, and it feels like
I can see the sands on the horizon
Everytime you are not around

I'm slowly drifting away (drifting away)
Wave after wave, wave after wave
I'm slowly drifting (drifting away)
And it feels like I'm drowning
Pulling against the stream
Pulling against the stream

I wish I could make it easy
Easy to love me, love me
But still I reach, to find a way
I'm stuck here in between
I'm looking for the right words to say

I'm slowly drifting, drifting away
Wave after wave, wave after wave
I'm slowly drifting (drifting away)
And it feels like I'm drowning

Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much
And that's an issue, but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends
It was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no calls
Now you're lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
You might also like
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no call
Now I'm lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

So, baby, pull me closer

109,109,109,Justin Bieber,What Do You Mean?,"128 ContributorsTranslationsEnglishEspañolΕλληνικάWhat Do You Mean? Lyrics

What do you mean?  Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes, but you wanna  say no
What do you mean?  Hey, yeah
When you don't want me to move, but you tell me to go
What do  you mean? Oh,  what do you mean?
Said you're runnin' outta time,  what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind, what do you mean?

You’re so indecisive of what I'm sayin'
Tryna catch the beat, make up your heart
Don't know if you're happy or complainin'
Don't want for us to end, where do I start?

First you wanna go to the left, then you wanna turn right (Right)
Wanna argue all day, makin' love all night (All night)
First you're up, then you’re down, and then  between ('Tween)
Oh, I really wanna know

What do you mean?  Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes, but you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey, yeah
When you don't want me to move, but you tell me to go
What do you mean? Oh, what do you mean?

Call it love and devotion
Call it a mom's adoration, foundation
A special bond of creation, ha
For all the single moms out there
Goin' through frustration
Clean Bandit, Sean da Paul
Anne-Marie, sing, make them hear

She works the nights by the water
She's gone astray, so far away
From her father's daughter
She just wants a life for her baby
All on her own, no one will come
She's got to save him (Daily struggle)

She tells him, ""Ooh, love
No one's ever gonna hurt you, love
I'm gonna give you all of my love
Nobody matters like you"" (Stay up there, stay up there)
She tells him, ""Your life
Ain't gon' be nothin' like my life (Straight)
You're gonna grow and have a good life
I'm gonna do what I've got to do"" (Stay up there, stay up there)

Satt helt aleine, så i speilet
Jeg kan'ke si jeg kjente bakken begynte å skjelve
Men det fikk meg til å tenke
Håper alt er bra
Er du ute og drikker med noen venner, eller slapper av?
Det har gått ett år og det er ting jeg forstår nå
Men la det være over og ikke dele alt vi bar på

Jeg vet, du vet, vi vet, va'kke klar for for alltid, det er streit
Jeg vet, du vet, vi vet, va'kke ment for hverandre, det er greit

Men hvis verden raser sammen, så er dette sagt
Du kommer hit, blir over her i natt
Bare gjøre det vi gjorde før
For hvem bryr seg vel hva vi to gjør
Hvis verden raser sammen, så er dette sagt
Hvis alt går over, holder jeg deg fast
Og hvis dette er et, ""Takk for alt""
Er det deg og meg jeg ville valgt
Hvis verden raser sammen, så er dette sagt (Sagt)
Hvis verden raser sammen, så er dette sagt (Sagt)

Jeg prøvde å se deg, se deg for meg
Jeg va'kke redd sjølv om jeg kjente bakken skjelve
Men jeg tenkte:
Husker du det, vi hadde vært ute
Og vi snubla inn, kom aldri lengre enn til kjøkkenet
Og det har gått ett år, og jeg trur jeg får det til, så
Jeg kan tenke på deg, hjertet slutter ikke å slå nå

Sitting all alone, looking in the mirror
I can't say I felt the ground start to shake
But it got me thinking
Hope all is good
Are you out drinking with some friends, or relaxing?
It's been a year and there are things I understand now
But let it be over and not share everything we carried

I know, you know, we know, not ready for forever, that's fine
I know, you know, we know, not meant for each other, it's okay

But if the world is collapsing, then this is said
You come here, stay over here tonight
Just do what we did before
Because who cares what the two of us do
If the world is collapsing, then this is said
If it's all over, I'll hold you tight
And if this is one, ""Thank you for everything""
Is it you and me I would choose
If the world is collapsing, then this is said (Said)
If the world is collapsing, then this is said (Said)

I tried to see you, imagine you
I didn't wake up scared even though I felt the ground shaking
But I thought:
Do you remember, we had been out
And we stumbled in, never got further than the kitchen
And it's been a year, and I think I'm getting it, so
I can think of you, my heart won't stop beating now

I said I hate you, I was angry
I got so mad, I slammed your door
You know I really love you, baby
I didn't mean to start a war
And I know there's a line, but I crossed it
And I pray that it won't leave a scar
I said I hate you, but I'm sorry
Sometimes I wish you'd cut me off

Maybe I should think before I talk
I get emotional and words come out all wrong
Sometimes I'm more honest than I want
So maybe I should think before
Maybe next time, I'll think before I talk

I try my best to make it better (better)
I'm all out of apologies (apologies)
You know I'm not good under pressure (pressure)
Guess hurting you is hurting me
I took all that we built and I broke it
And I pray it won't tear us apart
So let me piece it back together
I know I cut you pretty deep (know I cut you pretty deep)

Maybe I'm more honest than I wanna be
So maybe I should think before
Maybe next time, I'll think before I

Say something I might regret
And I might get too far under your skin
I can't lie, I wish we could try it again
Oh I, I wish we could try it again

Maybe I should think before I talk
I get emotional and words come out all wrong
Sometimes I'm more honest than I want
So maybe I should think before

I said I hate you, I was angry
I got so mad, I slammed your door
You know I really love you, baby
I didn't mean to start a war
And I know there's a line, but I crossed it
And I pray that it won't leave a scar
I said I hate you, but I'm sorry
Sometimes I wish you'd cut me off

Maybe I should think before I talk
I get emotional and words come out all wrong
Sometimes I'm more honest than I want
So maybe I should think before
Maybe next time, I'll think before I talk

I try my best to make it better (better)
I'm all out of apologies (apologies)
You know I'm not good under pressure (pressure)
Guess hurting you is hurting me
I took all that we built and I broke it
And I pray it won't tear us apart
So let me piece it back together
I know I cut you pretty deep (know I cut you pretty deep)

Wonderin' if I could sneak out the back
Nobody's even lookin' me in my eyes

Finish my drink, say, ""Shall we dance?"" (Hell, yeah)

I am not the only traveler
Who has not repaid his debt
I've been searching for a trail to follow again
Take me back to the night we met

What the hell I'm supposed to do
And then I can tell myself
Not to ride along with you

I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Oh, take me back to the night we met

When the night was full of terrors
And your eyes were filled with tears
When you had not touched me yet

Burns half as long when it's twice as bright

I took an arrow to the heart
I never kissed a mouth that tastes like yours
Strawberries and then somethin' more
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Lipstick on my guitar
Fill up the engine, we can drive real far
Go dancin' underneath the stars
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Mmm, you got me feelin' like

I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like I'm
Like my soul's on fire, I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singin' like

Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give mе the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til thе sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
And we'll say, ""Ooh, I love it when you do it like that""

Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
Into the car
On the backseat in the moonlit dark
Wrap me up between your legs and arms
Ooh, I can't get enough
You know you could tear me apart
Put me back together and take my heart
I never thought that I could love this hard
Ooh, I can't get enough

I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (Fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)

I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)

I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see

And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""

And it feels like yesterday was a year ago

'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

It was great at the very start
Hands on each other
Couldn't stand to be far apart
Closer the better

Now we're picking fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more

Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?


Too much time, losing track of us
Where was the real?
Undefined, spiraling out of touch
Forgot how it feels

'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?

Scared to be lonely, ooh, ooh, ooh

Even when we know it's wrong
And somebody better for us all along
Tell me, how can we keep holding on?
Holding on tonight 'cause we're scared to be lonely
Even when we know it's wrong
And somebody better for us all along
Tell me, how can we keep holding on?
Holding on tonight 'cause we're scared to be lonely

It was great at the very start
Hands on each other
Couldn't stand to be far apart
Closer the better

Now we're picking fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more

Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?


Too much time, losing track of us
Where was the real?
Undefined, spiraling out of touch
Forgot how it feels

All the messed up fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
It's like we keep coming back for more

Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?

Scared to be lonely, ooh, ooh, ooh

Even when we know it's wrong
And somebody better for us all along
Tell me, how can we keep holding on?
Holding on tonight 'cause we're scared to be lonely
Even when we know it's wrong
And somebody better for us all along
Tell me, how can we keep holding on?
Holding on tonight 'cause we're scared to be lonely
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight

[Vers 1: Kevin Lauren]
Du ser meg med fire baddies
Gjemt i tåka, vi fyrer fatties
Dem vil være queen for daddy
Sippe den leanen ferdig
Rydd veien for nye goons (Goons)
Stort på grønt pluss mye shrooms
Sitter på skolen med chille tunes
Melder jeg har roen på billig brus
Stepper inn på rulling, jeg går med shank (Shank)
Kaster på no' pulver for å score bank
Det er sånn du gjør det i min hood
Kommer ut av trenchesa så blir du good
Er på en drill jeg er all in, så festen går inn til morning
Hun ringer meg vill og horny, ordnings

[Chorus: Ballinciaga]
Bade bitches de går low, de lager show, de snorter coke
Og alle gutta her har hoes, vi stacker dough, vi snorter coke

[Vers 2: Ballinciaga]
Lommelerke fult, når jeg kommer på et party
Ikke tid til tull når det kommer til no' shawties
Dama hun er cute, hun er down på noe molly
Kjenner henne godt hun er alltid på no' bra shit
Og jeg er stolt av de gutta, stolt av de gutta der
Det blir sykt, når vi turner opp, turner oppi her
Og jeg clapper ass'en, clapper shawty, bad

[Bridge: Ballinciaga]
Turn opp nå (Ah)
Det er minner for livet når jeg blir dum (Ah)
Og alle vet at natten enda ung (Ah)
Jeg banger alltid uten en kondom (Ah) (Ah)

[Chorus: Ballinciaga]
Bade bitches de går low, de lager show, de snorter coke

Hidden in the fog, we fire fatties
You will be queen for daddy
Finish sipping that lean
Clear the way for new goons (Goons)
Big on greens plus lots of shrooms
Sitting at school with chill tunes
I report that I have peace of mind on cheap soft drinks
Stepping into rolling, I go with shank (Shank)
Throwing on no' powder to score bank
That's how you do it in my hood
Get out of the trenches and you'll be good
I'm on a drill and I'm all in, so the party goes into the morning
She calls me wild and horny, arrangement

And all the guys here have hoes, we stack dough, we snort coke

Wallet full, when I come to a party
No time for nonsense when it comes to no' shawties
Girl she's cute, she's down on something molly
Know her well, she's always on no' good shit
And I'm proud of those guys, proud of those guys there
It gets sick when we turn up, turn up here

Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe

If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

I was lightning before the thunder

Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say, ""You're basic,"" they say, ""You're easy""
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smiling from the stage
While you were clapping in the nosebleeds

Måtte komme meg vekk
Til et sted der alt er bedre

Og vi reiser i kveld
Til det syvеnde fjell

Went on a blast
Because baby you are my summer tonight
It started so well
Lost but happy
Because baby you are my summer tonight

The job complained, empty days
Had to get away
To a place where everything is better
Vidda fit perfectly

And we leave tonight
To the seventh mountain
What a height difference

Uh
Yeah, yeah

When I was young, I fell in love
We used to hold hands, man, that was enough (Yeah)
Then we grew up, started to touch
Used to kiss underneath the light on the back of the bus (Yeah)
I know your daddy didn't like me much
And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one
Oh, every day, she found a way out of the window to sneak out late

She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know that we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah

We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me

Seventeen, and we got a dream to have a family
A house, and everything in between
And then, oh, suddenly, we turned twenty-three
And now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously

And now I, I'm thinking back to when I was young
Back to the day when I was falling in love

Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
And baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight

Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, singing

My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
To start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me
Run away now, run away now

Uh
Yeah, yeah

When I was young, I fell in love
We used to hold hands, man, that was enough (Yeah)
Then we grew up, started to touch
Used to kiss underneath the light on the back of the bus (Yeah)
I know your daddy didn't like me much
And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one
Oh, every day, she found a way out of the window to sneak out late

She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know that we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah

We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me

Seventeen, and we got a dream to have a family
A house, and everything in between
And then, oh, suddenly, we turned twenty-three
And now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously
We got our dead-end jobs and got bills to pay
Our old friends are now our enemies
And now I, I'm thinking back to when I was young
Back to the day when I was falling in love

He used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know where we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
And baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, singing

We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it

One, one, one, one, one

Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)

My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
You might also like
I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
(Nowhere to turn, no way)
(Nowhere to turn, no)
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
(I never learn, I never learn)

But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

En broder, han er fra steetsa
Svært få, de ser tallet 30
Du kaller livet en fest
I min hood er det aldri konfetti
Brødre er dømt for ran
Jeg var med å planla, maybe
En ting, det er sikkert, bror
5. etasje passer sin baby (Brr)
Har gått flere år, no vacation
Stått på i min organization
Før var jeg down som en basement
Men jeg fant mitt sound med litt patience
Goonsa, de liker den smaken jeg putter på grønt
De spør hvordan jeg lacer
Jeg sa det er basically oppsa vi blazer

A brother, he is from steetsa
Very few, they see the number 30
You call life a party
In my hood there is never confetti
Brothers are convicted of robbery
I was part of the planning, maybe
One thing, that's for sure, brother
5th floor looks after his baby (Brr)

Persisted in my organization
Before I was down like a basement
But I found my sound with a little patience
Goonsa, they like the flavor I put on greens
They ask how I lace

It's not good enough for me
Since I've been with you, ooh
It's not gonna work for you
Nobody can equal me (I know)
I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm fucked up
I should know how to pick up
I'm gonna catch the rhythm
While she push up against me, ooh, and she tipsy
I had enough convo for 24
I peep'd you from across the room
Pretty little body dancin' like GoGo, hey
And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone (Ooh)
Why not? A fuckin' good time never hurt nobody
I got a little drink but it's not Bacardi
If you loved the girl, then I'm so, so sorry
I gotta give it to her like we in a marriage
Oh, like we in a hurry
No, no, I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do

Feelin' like I'm fresh out; Boosie (Boosie)
If they want the drama, got the Uzi (Uzi)
Ship the whole crew to the cruise ship (Cruise)
Doin' shit you don't even see in movies (Movies)
Ride with me, ride with me, boss (Boss)
I got a hard head, but her ass soft (Soft)
She want the last name with the ring on it
'Cause I pulled out a million cash, told her plank on it

And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone
Now you wanna choose

So pick up that dress for me
Leave the rest on
Too much convo for 24 hours
When you stand next to 24 karats
She left her man at home

It was Christmas Eve, babe, in the drunk tank
An old man said to me, ""Won't see another one""
And then he sang a song, 'The Rare Old Mountain Dew'
I turned my face away and dreamed about you

Got on a lucky one, came in eighteen-to-one
I've got a feeling this year's for me and you
So, Happy Christmas, I love you, baby
I can see a better time when all our dreams come true

They've got cars big as bars, they've got rivers of gold
But the wind goes right through you, it's no place for the old
When you first took my hand on a cold Christmas Eve
You promised me Broadway was waiting for me

You were handsome, you were pretty, queen of New York City
When the band finished playing, they howled out for more
Sinatra was swinging, all the drunks, they were singing
We kissed on a corner, then danced through the night

The boys of the NYPD choir
Were singing, ""Galway Bay""
And the bells were ringing out
For Christmas Day
You might also like
You're a bum, you're a punk, you're an old slut on junk
Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed
You scumbag, you maggot, you cheap, lousy faggot
Happy Christmas, your arse, I pray God it's our last

The boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing, ""Galway Bay""
And the bells are ringing out
For Christmas Day

""I could have been someone"" Well, so could anyone
You took my dreams from me when I first found you
I kept them with me, babe, I put them with my own
Can't make it all alone, I've built my dreams around you

So that I never feel alone again

But now they've brought you away from me
I hope they didn't get your mind
Your heart is too strong anyway
We need to fetch back the time
They have stolen from us

And I want you, we can bring it on the floor
You've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it

Stoned in paradise
Shouldn't talk about it

No sun is shining anymore
The only thing I feel is pain
Caused by absence of you
Suspense controlled in my mind

Shouldn't talk about it
And I want you, we can bring it on the floor
You've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancin' on, doin' the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise
Shouldn't talk about it
Shouldn't talk about it

Coldest winter for me
No sun is shining anymore
The only thing I feel is pain
Caused by absence of you
Suspense controlled in my mind
I cannot find the way outta here
I want you by my side
So that I never feel alone again

There are days
I wake up and I pinch myself
You're with me, not someone else
And I'm scared, yeah, I'm still scared
That it's all a dream

'Cause you still look perfect as days go by
Even the worst ones, you make me smile
I'd stop the world if it gave us time

'Cause when you love someone
You open up your heart
When you love someone
You make room
If you love someone
And you're not afraid to lose 'em
You probably never loved someone like I do
You probably never loved someone like I do

When you say
You love the way I make you feel
Everything becomes so real
Don't be scared, no, don't be scared
'Cause you're all I need

I thought it'd be hard to find
The one, 'til I found you

There once was a ship that put to sea
The name of the ship was the Billy of Tea
The winds blew up, her bow dipped down
O blow, my bully boys, blow
[Chorus
Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
One day, when the tonguin' is done
We'll take our leave and go

She had not been two weeks from shore
When down on her a right whale bore
The captain called all hands and swore
He'd take that whale in tow

Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tеa and rum
One day, when the tonguin' is donе

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
""Let It Snow"" is blasting out
But I won't get in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's

True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day, I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's

True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

Oh, I wanna have him beside me, like oh-woo-oh
On the 25th, by that fireplace, oh-woo-oh
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year I've got to be smart
Oh, baby
(Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me)
If he will be, if he will be here

Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room

But I won't get in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's

True love that he thinks of

Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk to the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home, you're like a dream come true
But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know

You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time that we might
Be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swear you'd moved overseas
That's what you said when you left me

Say you need more space
What are you, an astronaut?
Got the whole universe
So what you coming 'round here for?
Said you need more air
Are you underwater now?
We're not even in that deep
Acting like you're gonna drown

We were dancing late into the day
Half asleep and half awake
When the music starts to fade
We were laying, laying in my bed
For one second, you forget
Oh, here we go again

You say you want a break, so we break up
It's a mistake, so we make up
And then we make out, you freak out
Here we go again
You say we go too fast when you're sober
Then have a glass, you're coming over
And then we make out, you freak out

It never fades away, it's staying
Your kiss like broken glass on my skin
And all the greatest loves end in violence
It's tearing up my voice, left in silence

Baby, it hit so hard, holding on to my chest
Maybe you left your mark, reminding me to forget
It doesn't matter where you are, you can keep my regret
'Cause baby, I got these scars, reminding me to forget
Reminding me, I got these scars, to forget your love
Keep reminding me, ooh, to forget your love

You were so wrong
Letting me on
As you took me down to your bed
When I came home
You were long gone
Nothing left but ashes and dust

Ooh, I'm gonna break you
Wanna shake you til you're broken down
And I go
Ooh, I'm gonna take you
And make you regret the choice you made
And I go

(I don't need that kind of love)
I don't need that kind of love
(I don't need that kind of love)
Can only watch you leave
(Can't take that kind of love)
Can't take that kind of love
Can't take that kind of love

Said she don't want
Complicating
Doesn't wanna tie herself down
Keep it open
Easy going
I just can't seem to make it work out

We were lovers for the first time
Running all the red lights
The middle finger was our peace sign, yeah
We were sipping on emotions
Smoking and inhaling every moment
It was reckless and we owned it, yeah, yeah

We were high and we were sober
We were on and we were over
We were young and now I'm older
But I'd do it all again

Getting drunk on a train track
Way back, when we tried our first cigarettes (oh)
Ten dollars was a fat stack
I'd do it all again (oh)
Bomber jacket and a snapback
Your dad's black Honda was a Maybach (oh)
""Re: Stacks"" on the playback
I'd do it all again (oh)

We were lovers on a wild ride
Speeding for the finish line
Come until the end of our time, yeah
Started off as a wildfire
Burning down the bridges to our empire

If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would pop champagne and raise a toast
To all of the queens who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancing on your own

Can't live without me, you wanna, but you can't, nah-nah-nah
Think it's funny, but honey, can't run this show on your own
I can feel my body shake, there's only so much I can take
I'll show you how a real queen behaves (Oh)

No damsel in distress, don't need to save me
Once I start breathin' fire, you can't tame me
And you might think I'm weak without a sword
But if I had one, it'd be bigger than yours

If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would pop champagne and raise a toast

Baby, you're not dancing on your own

Disobey me, then baby, it's off with your head
Gonna change it and make it a world you won't forget (Oh)

And you can tell me if I'm off
But I see it on your face
When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time
In this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop

I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me, why are we wasting time
On all your wasted cryin'
When you should be with me instead?
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can

I'll stop time for you
The second you say you'd like me to
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby, just to wake up with you
Would be everything I need and this could be so different
Tell me what you want to do

Take my hand, we'll be fine
Promise I won't let you down

Promise I'll never let you down

I won't lie to you
I know he's just not right for you
And you can tell me if I'm off
But I see it on your face
When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time
In this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop

I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me, why are we wasting time
On all your wasted cryin'
When you should be with me instead?
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can

I'll stop time for you
The second you say you'd like me to
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby, just to wake up with you
Would be everything I need and this could be so different
Tell me what you want to do

'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me, why are we wasting time
On all your wasted cryin'
When you should be with me instead?
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can

Give me a sign
Take my hand, we'll be fine
Promise I won't let you down
Just know that you don't
Have to do this alone
Promise I'll never let you down

'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me, why are we wasting time

Baby, lay on back and relax
Kick your pretty feet up on my dash
No need to go nowhere fast
Let's enjoy right here where we at
Who knows where this road is supposed to lead?
We got nothing, but time
As long as you're right here next to me
Everything's gonna be alright

If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, just let it be
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, just let it be
So won't you ride with me, ride with me?
See where this thing goes
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, if it's meant to be

I don't mean to be so uptight
But my heart's been hurt a couple times
By a couple guys that didn't treat me right
I ain't gon' lie, ain't gon' lie
'Cause I'm tired of the fake love
Show me what you're made of
Boy, make me believe
Whoa, hold up, girl, don't you know you're beautiful?

Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down
Let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down

Yeah, I guess I'm a disappointment, doin' everything I can
I don't wanna make you disappointed, it's annoying
I just wanna make you feel like everything I ever do
Was never tryna make an issue for you, but I guess the more you
Thought about everything you were never even wrong
In the first place, right? Yeah, I'ma just ignore you
Walking towards you with my head down
Lookin' at the ground, I'm embarrassed for you
Paranoia, what did I do wrong this time?
That's parents for you
Very loyal? Shoulda had my back
But you put a knife in it—my hands are full
What else should I carry for you?
I cared for you, but…

Yeah, you don't wanna make this work
You just wanna make this worse
Want me to listen to you, but you don't ever hear my words
You don't wanna know my hurt, yeah
Let me guess, you want an apology, probably
How can we keep going at a rate like this?
We can't, so I guess I'ma have to leave
Please, don't come after me
I just wanna be alone right now, I don't really wanna think at all
Go ahead, just drink it off
Both know you're gonna call tomorrow like nothing's wrong
Ain't that what you always do?
I feel like every time I talk to you, you're in an awful mood
What else can I offer you?
There's nothing left right now, I gave it all to you

Packed all my clothes and I moved out
I don't even wanna go to your house
Every time I sit on that couch
I feel like you lecture me, eventually, I bet that we
Coulda made this work
And prolly woulda figured things out
But I guess I'm a letdown
But it's cool, I checked out
Oh, you wanna be friends now?
Okay, let's put my fake face on and pretend now
Sit around and talk about the good times that didn't even happen
I mean, why are you laughing?
Must have missed that joke, let me see if I can find a reaction
No, but at least you're happy

I don't know why I run away, oh, girl
Said, I make you cry when I run away

Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
I realize that I'm much too late
And you deserve someone better

Save your tears for another day (Oh yeah)
Save your tears for another day (Yeah)

I don't know why I run away
I'll make you cry when I run away
Save your tears for another day
Ooh, girl, I said (Ah)
Save your tears for another day (Ah)

Save your tears for another day (Ah)
Save your tears for another day (Ah)147Embed",en,"{'thing', 'walked', 'lyric', 'happy', 'love', 'nana', 'dancing', 'apart', 'away', 'tear', 'realize', 'broke', 'look', 'pretended', 'wasnt', 'stay', 'better', 'told', 'couldve', 'time', 'surprise', 'contributorstranslationsрусскийtürkçeespañolportuguêspolskideutschfrançaisفارسیshqipsave', 'heart', 'save', 'saw', 'crowded', 'someone', 'cry', 'fell', 'deserve', 'run', 'made', 'girl', 'room', 'eye', 'late', 'care', 'asked', 'single', 'falling', 'second', '224', 'caught', 'mine', 'teardrop', 'past', 'back'}"
