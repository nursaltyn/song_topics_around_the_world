Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me

So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know ﻿I was lost


I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
I hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game﻿ made for everyone
And love is the prize
You might also like
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost

I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know, I didn't know, I didn't know

1,1,1,Victor Leksell,Svag,"13 ContributorsSvag Lyrics
Visa dem hur stark du är
Låt dem aldrig se dig fälla tårar
Det är så jag växte upp
Var bara en man och ta det
Allting är okej om någon frågar
Det är så det vart för mig
Och jag kan lyfta flera tusen kilo
Och jag kan ta mig över hav och land
Kan göra nästan allt de ber om

Men jag kan inte va i samma rum som dig
Utan att jag tappar andan
Och varje gång du ser på mig
Känns som att mitt hjärta stannar
Försöker spela svår och stå emot
Men du river mina murar
Jag vet inte vad du gör
Men allting som du gör, det gör mig svag

Våga släppa taget nu
Sluta vara rädd för att bli sårad
Det är så det måste va
Det är väl bara så det är
Kan ändå inte fatta det
För jag kan göra nästan allt de ber om

Men du river mina murar
Jag vet inte vad du gör
Men allting som du gör, det gör mig svag

Aldrig våga visa mig svag
Men med dig blir det en annan sak
Med dig finns inget annat val
Med dig så vill jag vara svag
Nu vill jag bara va i samma rum som dig
Och jag vågar tappa andan
Och varje gång du ser på mig
Vill jag bara att tiden stannar

Men jag kan inte va i samma rum som dig
Utan att jag tappar andan
Och varje gång du ser på mig
Känns som att mitt hjärta stannar
Försöker spela svår och stå emot
Men du river mina murar
Jag vet inte vad du gör
Men allting som du gör, det gör mig svag1Embed","13 ContributorsSvag Lyrics
Show them how strong you are
Never let them see you shed tears
That's how I grew up 
Just be a man and take it
It's all right if someone asks
That's how it was for me
And I can lift several thousand kilos
And I can cross sea and land
Can do almost anything they ask

But I can't be in the same room as you
Without losing my breath
And every time you look at me
Feels like my heart is stopping
Trying to play hard and resist
But you tear down my walls
I don't know what you do
But everything you do, it makes me weak

Dare to let go now
Stop being afraid of getting hurt
That's the way it has to be
It's just the way it is
Still can't believe it
Because I can do almost anything they ask

But everything you do, it makes me weak

Never dare to show me weakness
But with you it becomes a different matter
With you there is no other choice
With you, I want to be weak
Now I just want to be in the same room as you
And I dare to lose my breath
And every time you look at me
I just want time to stop

But I can't be in the same room as you
Without losing my breath
And every time you look at me
Feels like my heart is stopping
Trying to play hard and resist
But you tear down my walls
I don't know what you do
But everything you do, it makes me weak1Embed",sv,"{'breath', 'almost', 'dare', 'someone', 'matter', 'play', 'kilo', 'contributorssvag', 'right', 'losing', 'trying', 'wall', 'cross', 'way', 'afraid', 'show', 'lose', 'believe', 'sea', 'thousand', 'look', 'stop', 'different', 'land', 'tear', 'hard', 'grew', 'time', 'lyric', 'hurt', 'heart', 'shed', 'room', 'lift', 'ask', 'weak', 'choice', 'stopping', 'man', 'resist', 'several', 'strong', 'asks', 'weakness', 'becomes'}"

You said that we would always be
Without you I feel lost at sea
Through the darkness you'd hide with me
Like the wind we'd be wild and free

You said you'd follow me anywhere
But your eyes tell me you won't be there

I've gotta learn how to love without you
I've gotta carry my cross without you
Stuck in the middle and I'm just about to
Figure it out without you
And I'm done sitting home without you
Fuck, I'm going out without you
I'm gonna tear this city down without you
I'm goin' Bonnie and Clyde without you

A club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go (Mm)
Me and my friends at the table doin' shots
Drinkin' fast and then we talk slow (Mm)
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I'll give it a chance now (Mm)
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance and now I'm singin' like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, ""Boy, let's not talk too much""
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is fallin' too
I'm in love with your body
And last night, you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you

Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate (Mm)
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doin' okay (Mm)
And leave and get in a taxi, and kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play and I'm singin' like

7,7,7,Hov1,Hon dansar vidare i livet,"32 ContributorsHon dansar vidare i livet Lyrics
Nu står hon där med vitsippor i håret
Tänker på allt ont, allt kan bli förlåtet
Visst har mörka perioder genomsyrat året
Ser på gamla bilder, brukade va sår
Men allting jag, allting jag, allting jag var
Försvann där och då, yeah, du likaså
Som man bäddar får man ligga, ingen bädda när vi låg
Ligger lågt, där i sängen var vi en, nu är vi ba två
Från alfa till omega, vi låg nog för att hela
Men stänger av varje gång någon spelar vår sång
Det här är överlevnad, det är klart vi bytte skepnad
Och vi förlorade varann med några hundradelar
Inget jag vill ha tillbaks, det är klart inget går i kras
Det är klart, det var du
Men förevigt var aldrig för oss, hjärtat
Och det vet vi nu

Hon dansar vidare i livet
Jag sparkar backspeglar på vägen hem
Hon har allt för dyra kläder
Men hon var min

Hon sa, ""Kasta bort din blyertspenna, båda klär i bläck""
Skriver du mitt namn så kan du få mig nu direkt
Alla vet att hon är vacker men finns mer: ett intellekt
Och ingen annan toppar vårat sex
Tårarna ska spruta, inte rinna, hon sa, ""Ligga inte luta""
Så vi gråter inte längre nu i regnet på en julafton
Och alla våra smycken va i plast
Men ändå vart det dyraste jag haft
Så nästa gång vi ses kommer jag att minnas för oss båda
Och du vet att jag klipper bilar på din gata
Men diskret kommer jag att hålla på oss två i hemlighet
Och inget är försent
Så förneka oss för alltid, kommer alltid va din första
Kanske inte bästa men jag hoppas på det största
Vi kanske ses igen när vi är vuxna
Och ligger som vi låg när vi va unga

Yo
Det var så länge sen jag såg dig, hur mår du nu?
Jag hörde att du träffa nån och att ni har kul
Inte för att snoka men jag vet ju vad du gör
Alla här i staden gillar skvaller så jag hör
Lyssnar du på radio och vad tycker du om oss?
Berätta nu om världen, var det bättre än du trott?
Stockholm är ju samma, varför kommer du tillbaks?
Fan, nu är vi gamla, vet du vad?
Vägen hit va lång men inte som vi trott
Vi kollade på lägenheter där vi ville bo
Din mamma skicka hem mig, hon sa, ""Nu har jag fått nog""
Du släppte ut ditt hjärta genom fönstret som en bok
Och det var blommor under kudden, båda drömde om varann
Det sprakar nog om er, men jag vill minnas att vi brann
Du sa att vi förlora men mitt hjärta, vet du vad?
Vi båda har ju vunnit vi mår bra

Hon dansar vidare i livet
Jag sparkar backspeglar på vägen hem
Hon har allt för dyra kläder
Men hon var min
För hon har blommor där i sitt hår
Tror hon har glömt hur det var då
Men jag ska minnas för oss två
Så bara gå8Embed","32 ContributorsShe dances on in life Lyrics
Now she stands there with white spots in her hair
Thinking of all evil, all can be forgiven
Certainly, dark periods have permeated the year
Looking at old pictures, used to be sore
But everything me, everything me, everything I was
Disappeared then and there, yeah, you too
As one makes a bed, one must lie, no one made a bed when we were lying
Lies low, there in the bed we were one, now we are two
From alpha to omega, we lay enough to heal
But shuts down every time someone plays our song
This is survival, of course we changed shape
And we lost each other by a few hundredths
Nothing I want back, it's clear nothing goes wrong
Of course, it was you
But forever was never for us, heart
And we know that now

She dances on in life
I kick rearview mirrors on the way home
She has way too expensive clothes
But she was mine

She said, ""Throw away your pencil, both wear ink""
If you write my name, you can get me now directly
Everyone knows she is beautiful but there is more: an intellect
And no one else tops our six
Tears should spray, not flow, she said, ""Don't lie down""
So we no longer cry now in the rain on a Christmas Eve
And all our jewelry is made of plastic
But it was still the most expensive I've had
So next time we meet I will remember for both of us
And you know I clip cars on your street
But discreetly I will keep the two of us a secret
And nothing is too late
So deny us forever, will always be your first
Maybe not the best but I hope for the biggest
Maybe we'll see each other again when we're adults
And lie as we did when we were young

She dances on in life

Yo
It's been so long since I saw you, how are you now?
I heard you're seeing someone and having fun
Not to snoop, but I know what you're doing
Everyone here in town likes to gossip, I hear
Do you listen to the radio and what do you think of us?
Now tell me about the world, was it better than you thought?
Stockholm is the same, why do you come back?
Damn, now we're old, you know what?
The road here was long, but not as we thought
We looked at apartments where we wanted to live
Your mother send me home, she said, ""I've had enough""
You let your heart out the window like a book
And there were flowers under the pillow, both dreaming of each other
It's probably crackling about you, but I want to remember that we were on fire
You said we lose but my heart, you know what?
We've both won, we're fine

She dances on in life
I kick rearview mirrors on the way home
She has way too expensive clothes
But she was mine
Because she has flowers there in her hair
I think she has forgotten what it was like back then
But I will remember for the two of us

I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all

I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you

Nos vamo' pegando, poquito a poquito
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza

They praise me in Mitt i but hate in Expressen
Nothing that was important, slander me in the press
Pull up with a sticky, make them shut up
Go ask Blizzy, I hate being famous
Here, they burn you like sticky-icky, my friend
Andree, he's Pippi, he can handle himself
I've never been fit but you can tag home

If you ba knew, you would be quiet, ey
If you ba knew, you would be chaste
She just sucked my dick, then she gave you a kiss
Ey, akhi, double filter, he mecca on a kush
Hey, I don't want a gun in my hand
If I have to, double the stomach, go forward quickly
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth
Life in the ghetto is tough, it's true
It's me and my brother, we have to stick together
So I told my mother ""I must be a man""
May God be with us, not the sheytan
And I fear him who sees us, no one else
Ey, leave me alone, ey, my honor is sacred
And my brother with a shurda here at my gig
All I have, of course I delish
Right is right and wrong is wrong

Here, they burn you like sticky-icky, my friend
Andree, he's Pippi, he can handle himself
I've never been fit but you can tag home

Rest in peace, all brothers perish
Fully coiffed, hand on the piston
Everyone plays something until death comes
Too many souls have fallen into the concrete
If there is risk, I lose my pairs
Mecca on a twig before the pitch, sayonara
Not logging out until we're all done
Hundred men with me, burn all slippery
And everyone here is hooked like amphetamines
And aina just looking, they want to put there
Soon they plant, lie with evidence, ey
Let's just live, leave my life
Best rating, hate my skin
Louis V fabric, new every day
Link up in Rud, shoutout Hjällbo
Sixteen Ugly, 164

Ayy, ayy

I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (Star, ayy, ayy)
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta ('Sta)
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, them the shottas ('Tas)
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grrra-ta-ta-ta (Ta, pow, pow, pow, ayy, ayy)

Switch my whip, came back in black
I'm startin' sayin', ""Rest in peace to Bon Scott"" (Scott, ayy)
Close that door, we blowin' smoke
She ask me light a fire like I'm Morrison ('Son, ayy)
Act a fool on stage
Prolly leave my fuckin' show in a cop car (Car, ayy)
Shit was legendary
Threw a TV out the window of the Montage
Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn
Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryna get in
Sayin', ""I'm with the band"" (Ayy, ayy)
Now she actin' outta pocket, tryna grab up on my pants
Hundred bitches in my trailer say they ain't got a man

I've been in the Hills fuckin' superstars
Feelin' like a popstar (21, 21, 21)
Drankin' Henny, bad bitches jumpin' in the pool
And they ain't got on no bra (Bra)
Hit her from the back, pullin' on her tracks
And now she screamin' out, ""¡No más!"" (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
They like, ""Savage, why you got a 12 car garage
And you only got six cars?"" (21)
I ain't with the cakin', how you kiss that? (Kiss that?)
Your wifey say I'm lookin' like a whole snack (Big snack)
Green hundreds in my safe, I got old racks (Old racks)
L.A. bitches always askin', ""Where the coke at?"" (21, 21)
Livin' like a rockstar, smash out on a cop car
Sweeter than a Pop-Tart, you know you are not hard

(Yei Gonzalez)
Haha, allahwi

Min bror sitter på fullt med sticks som en kaktus
Kokainet här väcker upp dig som en kalldusch
Alltid tjugofyra, mannen, inte som en nattbuss
Fett starkt hasch, du kan åka på en halsfluss
Aina skickar agent, de tror James Bond
Mannen, oppsen har mens, de behöver tampong
Och det ingen abonnent om du råkar va broke
Och oj, det luktar bränt, huh, vem blev smoked?
Andas lite grann, tar din luft som en ballong
Mannen, som en sportman, kokainet, den är strong
Bara kontant, ingen swish eller sånt
Litar inte på nån bank, dockar i en skokartong
Jag hade på mig bandana, black hoodie (Black hoodie)
Min bror är tusengubbe, inte hundring (Inte hundring)
Du blir lämnad med ett hål som ett donut, ugly money
Men mina fucking pengar, de fick en glow-up
Stashet gick i puberteten, den blev thick
Aina sätter på blå för jag sitter på vitt
Svär, du ska lyssna om min broder säger ""Sitt""
Mannen, ring ambulansen, mina varor, de är sick (Sick, sick)

Yo, de vill rida Kazos våg (Greekazo)
Försent, tåget har redan åkt, försent
Försent, tåget har redan åkt

2019, bara vinster, det är sjukt ju
Det finns en 19 som är dämpad med ett grönljus
Vi kan fånga nitton bodies vid ett rödljus
En galen somalie med en rysk som varit tyst
En hal grek som trycker av från en tysk
Femtio lappar och jag står på scen
Man ger och tar men jag vill ha och ta ännu mer
Vilka skuldkänslor? Varje gång jag hör hans namn, jag ler
Gå ner på knä och till min tabbe du ber (Haha)
Cuz och det Greekazo, gör kaos och hamna inkasso
Hämta massor, det är min vikt nu, länge sen jag skicka femmor
Jag har en vän som lämnar större bett än bin

Ey, de vill va på min nivå (Cuz)
Yo, de vill rida Kazos våg (Greekazo)

Bitch, du är begravd, skicka Marabouchoklad
Hela Hässelby är gata, ni kan bara trottoar
För mycket prat, hat, fokus på min mat (Grr)
Pengar gör mig glad, Hässelby har låst denna stad
Aldrig varit ett besvär (Nej), jag är enkelt att ta på
Så det klart jag haft det bad, det kostar leva såhär
Tjugo-nåt och miljonär, när vi lever, lever som vi lär
Det svårt att leva som man lär, skrrt, pow

Haha, god

My brother is full of sticks like a cactus
The cocaine here wakes you up like a cold shower
Always twenty-four, man, not like a night bus
Fat strong hash, you can go on a throat flu
Aina sends agent, they think James Bond
Man, opps are on their periods, they need tampons
And no subscriber if you happen to be broke
And oops, it smells burnt, huh, who got smoked?
Breathe a little, take your air like a balloon
The man, like a sportsman, the cocaine, it is strong
Cash only, no swish or anything like that
Don't trust any bank, dolls in a shoe box
I wore the bandana, black hoodie (Black hoodie)
My brother is a centenarian, not a centenarian (Not a centenarian)
You are left with a hole like a doughnut, ugly money
But my fucking money, they got a glow-up
Stash went into puberty, it became thick
Aina puts on blue because I sit on white
Swear you'll listen if my brother says ""Sit""
Man, call the ambulance, my goods, they're sick (Sick, sick)

2019, only profits, it's crazy
There is a 19 which is dimmed with a green light
We can catch nineteen bodies at a red light
A crazy Somali with a Russian who has been silent
A slippery Greek pushing off a German
Fifty notes and I'm on stage
You give and take, but I want to have and take even more
What guilt? Every time I hear his name, I smile
Get down on your knees and to my fool you pray (Haha)
Cuz and that Greekazo, make chaos and end up debt collection
Download lots, that's my weight now, long time since I sent high fives
I have a friend who leaves bigger bites than bees

Ey, they wanna be on my level (Cuz)

Working as a company, CEO, plug talk
Money talk, man, the MAC portable so my brother taps off
Bitch, you're buried, send Marabou chocolate
The whole of Hässelby is a street, you can only walk on pavements
Too much talk, hate, focus on my food (Grr)
Money makes me happy, Hässelby has locked this city
Never been a hassle (No), I'm easy going
So of course I had it bad, it costs to live like this
Twenty-somethings and millionaires, when we live, live as we teach
The difficulty of living as you learn, skrrt, pow

And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?

And darling, I will be loving you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three

Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So honey, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do you recognise me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
""Happy Christmas,"" I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying, ""I love you,"" I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

(Happy Christmas)
Ah, ah-ah
Ooh-woah
Oh-oh

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do you recognise me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
""Happy Christmas,"" I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying, ""I love you,"" I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special, oh)
Oh, oh, baby

A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face of a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover, but you tore me apart
Ooh-ooh
Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave me away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart (I gave you my heart)
A man undercover, but you tore him apart
Maybe next year
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special

Special
Someone
Someone
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special
Who give me something in return
(I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone)
Hold my heart and watch it burn
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special
I thought you were here to stay
How could you love me for a day?
I thought you were someone special
I gave you my heart
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
You gave it away
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone

Lev nu, dö sen
Tänk inte något mer på morgondagen även om regnet bara öser
Har varit där på botten, ja, det löser sig
Det skiftar snabbt även om molnen ligger över dig
Se mig flyga, se mig dyka
Se mig glida runt rakt igenom, upp och ner
Genom tid och rum, har jag blivit dum?
Finns inga hinder nu, skiter i vem som vinner nu
Jag har inte någon tid för sånt
Måste flytta härifrån innan det blir för trångt

Jag säger, ""Som man bäddar får man ligga""
Och jag kommer aldrig bli som dem

För nu tackar jag livet och höjer mitt glas
Jag tar inget för givet, baby, du och jag
För nu tackar jag livet och ingen jävel kan hindra mig
För vem har sagt att dagar som gått kommer igen?
Lev nu, dö sen (Lev nu, dö sen)

Lev nu, skrik sen
Även om det är fattigt just nu, jag lovar du blir rik sen
Och jag snackar inte materiella saker
Det är sånt som stressar dig, håller dig vaken
Gör det som du gör bäst (Gör bäst)
Forma ditt öde, rid aldrig på någon hög häst
Se mig skratta, se mig gråta, se mig frälsa dem
Om inte det så har du aldrig riktigt älskat nån
Och jag har aldrig nån beef med folk
Mamma sa alltid till mig, ""Linda, skit i sånt""

För vem har sagt att dagar som gått kommer igen?
Lev nu dö sen, lev nu, dö sen
(Lev nu dö sen) Lev nu, dö sen
(Lev nu dö sen)

Lev nu dö sen, var dig själv
Tar de höger går du vänster
Ser du gränser, tänker jag
Kan inte leva bakom stängsel
Lev nu, dö sen, var dig själv
Tar de höger går du vänster

Jag säger, ""Som man bäddar får man ligga""
Och jag kommer aldrig bli som dem

För nu tackar jag livet och höjer mitt glas
Jag tar inget för givet, baby, du och jag
För nu tackar jag livet och ingen jävel kan hindra mig

Live now, die later
Don't think anything more about tomorrow even if the rain just pours
Been there at rock bottom, yes, it works out
It shifts quickly even if the clouds are above you
Watch me fly, watch me dive
Watch me slide around straight through, up and down
Through time and space, have I become stupid?
There are no obstacles now, who cares who wins now
I don't have time for that
Gotta move out of here before it gets too crowded

I say, ""As you make your bed, you get to lie""
And I will never be like them

For now I thank life and raise my glass
I take nothing for granted, baby, you and me
Because now I thank life and no bastard can stop me
Because who said that days gone by will come again?
Live now, die later (Live now, die later)

Live now, scream later
Even if it's poor right now, I promise you'll be rich later
And I'm not talking about material things
It's the kind of thing that stresses you out, keeps you awake
Do what you do best (Do best)
Shape your destiny, never ride any high horse
Watch me laugh, watch me cry, watch me save them
If not, you've never really loved anyone
And I never have any beef with people
Mom always told me, ""Linda, screw that""

Live now, die later, be yourself
If they take the right, you go left
Do you see limits, I think
Can't live behind fences

If they take the right, you go left

Oh, misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke

Watch the flames climb high into the night

Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside high

And if we should die tonight, we should all die together

Callin' out, Father, oh, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
Desolation comes upon the sky

And as the sky's fallin' down, it crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground, I hear my people screamin' out

I met you in the dark, you lit me up
You made me feel as though I was enough
We danced the night away, we drank too much
I held your hair back when you were throwin' up

Then, you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, ""I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest""

I knew I loved you then, but you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you, but I never showed
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old

I met you in the dark, you lit me up
You made me feel as though I was enough
We danced the night away, we drank too much
I held your hair back when you were throwin' up

Then, you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, ""I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest""

I knew I loved you then, but you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you, but I never showed
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head

Säg vad har du gett mig, jag kan inte stå nu
Ramlar runt på borden, föll omkull, men det förstår du
Alla här har sett mig, jag kan inte gå nu
Börjar tappa orden, är för full och skriker fuck you
Jag vill ha en, två, tre men jag tål nog mer
Och jag lovar dig att jag mår bra när jag ser en bar

Men jag kan inte gå, ingen fattar hur jag mår
Jag är fucked up från igår igen, vad har du gett mig?
Nåt jag inte tål, snälla säg mig var du står
Jag minns inget från igår min vän, vad har du gett mig?
Jag kan inte gå, ingen fattar hur jag mår
Jag är fucked up från igår igen, vad har du gett mig?
Nåt jag inte tål, snälla säg mig var du står
Jag minns inget från igår min vän, vad har du gett mig?
Vad gör jag nu?

Jag kan inte se om du är den som vill hjälpa mig hem
Eller vill du se mig falla igen, när du vet hur det känns
Jag kan lika gärna vara själv, så du kan lämna mig här är du snäll
För jag vill aldrig mera vara den som bara bang bang, bangar igen
Jag vil vara den som tar hela staden hem och tillbaka
Du som bad mig att följa med
Jag måste säga dig att jag snart kommer falla så hårt

Kommer aldrig klara mig utan hjälp, för

Tell me what have you given me, I can't stand now
Tumbling around on the tables, fell over, but you get the idea
Everyone here has seen me, I can't go now
Starting to lose words, is too drunk and screams fuck you
I want one, two, three but I can probably take more
And I promise you I feel good when I see a bar

But I can't go, no one understands how I feel
I'm fucked up from yesterday again, what have you given me?
Something I can't stand, please tell me where you stand
I don't remember anything from yesterday my friend, what have you given me?
I can't walk, no one understands how I feel
I'm fucked up from yesterday again, what have you given me?
Something I can't stand, please tell me where you stand
I don't remember anything from yesterday my friend, what have you given me?
What am I doing now?

I can't tell if you're the one who wants to help me home
Or do you want to see me fall again, when you know how it feels
I might as well be by myself, so you can leave me here please
Because I never want to be the one who just bang bang, bang again
I want to be the one to take the whole city home and back
You who asked me to come along
I have to tell you, I'm about to fall so hard

Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me
""Go make yourself some friends, or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was seven years old

It was a big, big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven, smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich, so we were out to make that steady figure

Once, I was eleven years old, my daddy told me
""Go get yourself a wife, or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was eleven years old

I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once, I was twenty years old (Lukas Graham!)

I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me, at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later
Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
I was writing 'bout everything I saw before me
Once, I was twenty years old

Soon, we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon, we'll be thirty years old

I'm still learning about life, my woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs, and I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me, some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind, my brother, I'm still sorry

Soon, I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month
Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold?
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
Soon, I'll be sixty years old
Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold?
Or will I have a lot of children who can hold me?

I know you want to be with me
But you don't know what you're getting into, into
No, oh, maybe I should have said that before
It gets serious, but don't dare then, because then
Would you probably go like all before you they drew
Right as soon as I showed myself and that (Eh)
Not a secret, I know
They say I'm crazy and
I feel you should know
Oh-oh, made a list so you know

One, is awake every night
And two, I drink every single shot
And three, I can be totally obsessed
And four, go to angry from laughter
At five, I hardly compromise
So six, run hide fast
Can list more because I'm complicated

Varje gång det tystnar i luren hör jag dina andetag
Känner att du känner dig kluven och jag väntar på ett svar
Kan du komma hem nu? Vi löser allting sen
Det tystnar i luren
Sitter här och räknar sekunder, försöker inse vad som sker
Du är inte min inte längre, finns det en så finns det fler
Kan inte komma hem nu, vill bara vara själv
Det tystnar i luren

Du ringer när det regnar
Du ringer bara mig när du är full
Alla mina änglar
Gråter skurar för min skull
Du ringer bara mig när du är full och dum och tjatar med mig hem
Det tystnar i luren

Var jag en idiot som försökte fylla tomrummen i dig?
Hade inte svaren du sökte, radera bilderna på mig
Du höll bara i mig, men aldrig riktigt om mig
Det tystnar i luren

Du ringer när det regnar
Du ringer bara mig när du är full
Alla mina änglar
Gråter skurar för min skull
Du ringer bara mig när du är full och dum och tjatar med mig hem
Det tystnar i luren

Det tystnar i luren

Du ringer när det regnar
Du ringer bara mig när du är full

Every time the receiver goes silent, I hear your breathing
Sensing that you feel torn and I'm waiting for an answer
Can you come home now? We'll sort everything out later
The handset goes silent
Sitting here counting seconds, trying to realize what is happening
You are not mine anymore, if there is one there are more
Can't come home now, just want to be by myself

You call when it rains
You only call me when you're drunk
All my angels
Crying bursts for me
You only call me when you're drunk and stupid and drag me home

Was I an idiot trying to fill the voids in you?
Didn't have the answers you were looking for, delete the pictures of me
You just held me, but never really about me

Och de fattar inget när jag säger, ""Ung och kåt""
Sjunger, ""Kärleken är blind"" men det är väl så det går

Hon har en rik familj men de har gangster vibes

I took a pill in Ibiza to show Avicii I was cool
And when I finally got sober, felt 10 years older
But fuck it, it was something to do
I'm living out in LA, I drive a sports car just to prove
I'm a real big baller 'cause I made a million dollars
And I spend it on girls and shoes
But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster
And be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs

I'm just a singer who already blew his shot
I get along with old timers
'Cause my name's a reminder of a pop song people forgot
And I can't keep a girl, no
'Cause as soon as the sun comes up
I cut 'em all loose and work's my excuse
But the truth is I can't open up

What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawing me in and you kicking me out
You've got my head spinning, no kidding
I can't pin you down
What's goin' on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me
But I'll be alright

My head's under water, but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you

När jag tittar in i ljuset
Ser jag pusslet som vi lagt
Och då faller alla bitarna på plats
När jag hör dem säga orden
Som de många gånger sagt
Så många gånger så man nästan tror på allt
Nä, jag tittar inte ner mer
Jag tittar upp mot himlen
Så, finns det nån här, finns du ens?
För idag ska de höra sanningen
Jag ska aldrig ta skit igen

Jag ska bara vara mig själv
Ba va, bara få va mig själv
Jag ska bara vara mig själv
Ba va, vill bara få va mig själv

De alla gånger man har väntat
På att dagen ska ta slut
Men alla orden följer ändå med en hem
Tror att man kan vänja sig
Och kanske kan stå ut
Men jag ska aldrig mer titta ner igen

When I look into the light
I see the puzzle that we put together
And then all the pieces fall into place
When I hear them say the words
As they have said many times
So many times that you almost believe everything
Nah, I'm not looking down anymore
I look up at the sky
So, is anyone here, do you even exist?
Because today they will hear the truth
I will never take shit again

I'll just be myself
Please, just let me be myself
I'll just be myself
Ba va, just want to be myself

All the times you've waited
For the day to end
But all the words still come with a home
I think you can get used to it
And maybe can stand it
But I will never look down again

Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well

Do you recall, not long ago
We would walk on the sidewalk?
Innocent, remember?
All we did was care for each other
But the night was warm
We were bold and young
All around, the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun

Longing for you to come home

We would only hold on to let go

I look up from the ground
To see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me
And I see there's something you're trying to hide
And I reach for your hand but it's cold
You pull away again
And I wonder what's on your mind
And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble and your voice begins to break
You say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's
They were my mate's
And I feel the colour draining from my face

And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be alright""

So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent
And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head
And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone
And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on
But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
But I just wanna stay

""I know you love her, but it's over, mate

So bottoms up, let's forget tonight
You'll find another and you'll be just fine
Let her go""

But nothing heals the past like time
And they can't steal
The love you're born to find
But nothing heals the past like time
And they can't steal
The love you're born to find

""I know you love her, but it's over, mate

Well, you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go

Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

But you only need the light when it's burning low

Where there's a will, there's a way, kinda beautiful
And every night has its day, so magical
And if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle
That can't be defeated
For every tyrant a tear for the vulnerable
In every lost soul the bones of a miracle
For every dreamer a dream we're unstoppable
With something to believe in

Monday left me broken
Tuesday I was through with hopin'
Wednesday my empty arms were open
Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
Thank the stars it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love

Skrattar åt hat längst bak i en Merca

Folk, de är sura
Ni är hemma, jag är ute i kylan
Räknar ba cash, alla andra ba yrar
Fråga min bror, jag fick staden att lysa
Ge dem en chans, mannen, du är hal
Jag är pappa, du ska göra allting som jag sa
Åker bilar i Dubai när jag vill utan tak
Folk de undrar vad jag var
Men det ingen fara, låt det vara så, för nu jag är tillbaks
Jag är tia, min broder, fråga tie
Mannen, du är skam som en orm utan filter
Jag är för trött, massa hundar och fittor
Jag är på pent, massa pengar och fnitter

Laughing at hate in the back of a Merca

You're at home, I'm out in the cold

Give them a chance, man, you're slippery

Driving cars in Dubai whenever I want without a roof
People they wonder what I was
But that's okay, let it be, because now I'm back

Jag smilar framför kameran, folk, under bordet

Instead of honoring me with prizes and trophies
The police know I'm capable
The correctional service moves around us like nomads
Out there I can fill premises
Out there I can put a policeman's salary on a pair of sandals
My gun has caused me to avoid a couple of scandals
I tend to change cars like people change channels
Ah, project baby with high risk factors
I miss P3 Gold, I sat with full restrictions
Not much happens under the sun
I smile in front of the camera, people, under the table

Outside of music we make hits
Soon we will go from Nike Air Max to a suit and tie
Branded thug
My life is like a verse from Troublesome '96, ey

I walk with the young and the heartless
We don't give a fuck, he's lawless
I'm abroad pumps FLAWLESS
Heartless
Baby, I'm straight from the projects
I'm just another brother making progress
Rémy Martin and good grass
Easy to say, we are fine here
You might also like
There is no avoiding my music
I know Franky would love this verse if he were alive
I'm a soldier, plus I'm a playboy
A fucking high roller, I know how to make money
Always armed, I do what I must
I blow Mary Jane, smoke like a chimney
Tell these rappers, start throwing the mics
He who wants to drive, he gets to swim with the fishes
It's hard to keep pace, I'm a strategist, I play chess
If I get a position, I hit 'em up
I always check my back, I can't be shocked
Stockholm's finest, known as Top Shottaz

Glaset är halvtomt just nu
Halvfullt om du varit här
Dagarna går men vill aldrig ta slut
Önskar jag var där du är
Gatorna ekar av dig
Minnen som alltid finns där
Allting jag ser är en film om oss två
Har fastnat i vår lilla värld

Jag ska göra en säng av rosor
Jag ska tända varenda ljus
Jag ska spela den musiken
Som du alltid brukar sjunga
Jag ska göra en säng av rosor till dig

Stockholm är gråare nu
Sommaren gick allt för fort
Nu nalkas våren och snart är du här
Längtat mer än du nog trott

Jag ska göra en säng av rosor
Jag ska tända varenda ljus
Jag ska spela den musiken
Som du alltid brukar sjunga
Jag ska göra en säng av rosor till dig

The glass is half empty right now
Half full if you've been here
The days go by but never want to end
Wish I was where you are
The streets echo with you
Memories that are always there
All I see is a movie about the two of us
Stuck in our little world

I will make a bed of roses
I will light every single candle
I will play that music
As you always sing
I will make you a bed of roses

Stockholm is grayer now
The summer went by all too quickly
Now spring is approaching and soon you will be here
Took longer than you probably thought

I will make a bed of roses
I will light every single candle
I will play that music
As you always sing
I will make you a bed of roses

Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer till our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves

And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home

Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Oh, you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were 16
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me, well, that's okay, baby
Only words bleed inside these pages

Låt aldrig hoppet försvinna
Det är mörkt nu
Men det blir ljusare igen
Tänd ett ljus för allt du tror på
För den här planeten vi bor på
Tänd ett ljus
För jordens barn

Jag såg en stjärna falla
Det var inatt när alla sov
Jag tror jag önskade
Att du var nära
För en minut sen brann den
För en sekund sen försvann den
Var det bara jag som såg?
På radion sjöng de om fred på jorden
Jag ville tro de slitna orden

Jag fick ett kort från Wyndham
Jag visste inte var det låg
Jag såg på kartan
Du är på andra sidan jorden
Men det är samma himmel
Det är samma hav och stjärnan som jag såg
Föll för alltid som vi drömmer
Föll för att vi aldrig glömmer

Tänd ett ljus och låt det brinna
Låt aldrig hoppet försvinna
Det är mörkt nu
Men det blir ljusare igen

I saw a star fall
It was last night when everyone was asleep

A second ago it disappeared
Was it just me who saw?

Vet precis vad hon gör när hon smeker din kind
Du svävar fram aldrig förr så lätt
Säg har du sett nån så fin
Om du ser henne försök låta bli
Du faller som ett sommarregn
Du spenderar några dagar I hennes säng
Intalar dig själv att det här går lätt
Säg har du sett nån så fin
Men om du ser henne försök låta bli
Men hon svänger som en samba-takt
Och du sväljer din galla med självförakt
Du blir tom som efter en ensam kärleksakt
Säg har du sett Josefin
Om du ser henne försök låta bli

Given you some time, maybe it has to end?

I thought you understood when you listen to my song
You heard every word, yet you choose to go
Do you want to get here before we fall apart?
Before it's too late, or we'll leave it here

I know where I'm going, but you're not sure
I know this will calm me down eventually
But nothing is good, you are waiting for someone else

I've been hearin' symphonies
Before, all I heard was silence
A rhapsody for you and me
And every melody is timeless
Life was stringin' me along
Then you came and you cut me loose
Was solo, singin' on my own
Now I can't find the key without you

And now your song is on repeat
And I'm dancin' on to your heartbeat
And when you're gone, I feel incomplete
So, if you want the truth

I just wanna be part of your symphony
Will you hold me tight and not let go?
Symphony
Like a love song on the radio
Will you hold me tight and not let go?

I'm sorry if it's all too much
Every day you're here, I'm healin'
And I was runnin' outta luck

And that's an issue, but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends
It was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

And four years, no calls

And I-I-I can't stop

So, baby, pull me closer

I thought that I'd been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now, I need someone to breathe me back to life

Got a feeling that I'm goin' under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needin' stitches
Trippin' over myself, aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needin' stitches

Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart, cold to the touch

Vem skulle hjälpa mig uthärda livet här ute?
Vem skulle ge mig den kraften som jag måste få?
Vem skulle trösta mig? Jag är så liten på jorden
Om du inte fanns till. Vad skulle jag göra då?

Utan dig är jag en spillra på ett mörkt och stormigt hav
Du måste finnas, du måste.  Hur kan du då överge mig?
Jag vore ingenstans

Vem skulle känna min ånger och sedan förlåta?
Friden i själen. Ja, vem skulle skänka mig den
Vem skullе så ta emot mig till slut efter dödеn?
Om du inte fanns till. Vem tog hand om mig sen?

Jag är ett proffs på mörka dagar
Så jävla trygg i smuts och damm
Det kanske låter som jag alltid klagar
Men du är likadan
Jag mår bäst när hela Stockholm regnar
När kyrkklockor ringer ut i moll
Om jag bara hade lite pengar
Som om det spelar roll

Får jag gömma mig hos dig ett tag
Tills allt känns lite bättre?

Så if I lose my mind och vill hoppa från balkongen
Kommer du fånga mig då?
Vi kan dra nånstans och bara dansa med vår ångest
Kan inte ångra nåt ändå

Jag håller i dig så du nästan blöder
Men du har sagt att det är helt okej
Ja, du förstår mig

So damn safe in dirt and dust
It might sound like I'm always complaining

When church bells ring out in minor
If only I had some money
As if it matters

Can I hide with you for a while?
Until everything feels a little better?

So if I lose my mind and want to jump from the balcony
Will you catch me then?

Can't regret anything though

Du var varje sommarnatt
En utefest i Hornstullsstrand
Jag tänker på dig nu ibland
Och undrar hur det blev med allt
Jag skulle ringa om jag hann
Men tappade bort ditt efternamn
Jag är vid bänken där vi satt
Och ristar över våra namn

Okej, what's up, vad händer?
Jag har varit i alla länder
Sett solen, månen, regnbågen samtidigt
Så vad händer?
För jag är samma jag, som sett dig vara på hemmafest
Och sett dig röka två cigg sen, som du alltid gjorde efter sex
Så, får jag lov, som vi dansade på ett sommarlov?
Bruka tänka att det var med dig
Så när jag dansar har jag blundat hårt
Men, säg en sista gång, vi båda har ju träffat nån
Och jag vart nära på att skaffa barn och det hände mer än en gång, yeah
När livet kommer kring, har jag varit bra på att ta ingenting
Har kommit över dig så många gånger att jag stått på knä, givit bort en ring
Ångrar mig, sen ger bort en till
Inte för att det var fel på nån

You were every summer night
An outdoor party in Hornstullsstrand
I think about you now sometimes
And wondering how it all turned out
I would call if I could
But lost your last name
I'm at the bench where we sat
And carve over our names

Okay, what's up, what's going on?
I have been to every country
See the sun, the moon, the rainbow at the same time
So what is happening?
Because I'm the same me who saw you at a house party
And saw you smoke two cigarettes later, like you always did after sex
So, may I, like we danced on a summer vacation?
Used to think it was with you
So when I dance, I have closed my eyes tightly
But, say one last time, we've both met someone
And I came close to having a baby and it happened more than once, yeah
When life comes around, I've been good at taking nothing
Got over you so many times I got down on one knee, gave away a ring
Regrets, then gives away another one
Not because it was anyone's fault
The problem was from the start that you weren't one of them

This is the puzzle of life when the right pieces have fallen
Would be looking for summer cottage when red leaves have fallen
So what life puzzle has you figured out, honey?
I'm laughing through all the tears now, at your order
Before everything here is deserted
Hornstull, we're over
You were everything I wanted, but nothing I needed
I was everything they wanted me to be, because only you know I bleed
All for your sake
It was you, Hornstull
I won't be the pretty one
Nor be the beautiful one
But I will always be the one, the one who always makes you laugh
So bye, bye
Here is everything you would get
I'm burning the bench where we sat, so let me go

I think about you now sometimes
And wondering how it all turned out
I would call if I could
But lost your last name

I had a dream
We were sipping whiskey neat
Highest floor, The Bowery
And I was high enough
Somewhere along the lines
We stopped seeing eye to eye
You were staying out all night
And I had enough

No, I don't wanna know
Where you been or where you're goin'
But I know I won't be home
And you'll be on your own

Who's gonna walk you
Through the dark side of the morning?
Who's gonna rock you
When the sun won't let you sleep?
Who's waking up to drive you home
When you're drunk and all alone?
Who's gonna walk you
Through the dark side of the morning?

Alla verkar veta vem jag är
I alla fall dom gånger jag gör fel
Alla känner mig förutom jag
Jag som knappt bestämt vem jag vill va
Fin och ful och allting däremellan
Aldrig mer, men kanske en gång till
Jag vill ha det ofta, ha det sällan
Jag vet vad jag vill, jag vet ingenting

Känns som jag är gjord utav sand
Jag bygger högt och rasar ibland
Hittar mig nån helt annanstans
Där jag kan börja om, starkare imorrn
Känns som jag är gjord utav sand
Jag bygger mina murar för hand
River dom och testar mig fram
Så jag kan börja om, större nästa gång

Just när jag tror jag har hittat hem
Ska jag packa väskorna igen
Jag vill inte ha någonting för lätt
Måste våga trampa lite snett
Stark och svag och allting däremellan
Aldrig mer, men kanske en gång till
Jag har inget val, jag måste välja
Jag vet vad jag vill, jag vet ingenting

Everyone seems to know who I am
At least the times I make mistakes
Everyone knows me except me
Me who barely decided who I want to be
Nice and ugly and everything in between
Never again, but maybe one more time
I want it often, have it rarely
I know what I want, I know nothing

Feels like I'm made of sand
I build high and crash sometimes
Find me somewhere completely different
Where I can start over, stronger tomorrow
Feels like I'm made of sand
I build my walls by hand
Tear them up and test me out
So I can start over, bigger next time

Just when I think I've found home
Shall I pack my bags again?
I don't want anything too easy
Must dare to tread a little crookedly
Strong and weak and everything in between
Never again, but maybe one more time
I have no choice, I have to choose
I know what I want, I know nothing

Vet att du inte är bra för mig
Tror jag behöver dig ändå
Vi träffas, har sex i bland
Du ringer ditt ex i bland, vafan händer?
Båda vet nog att vi träffar andra
Men vi blundar när vi gör det med varandra
Tar emot när du ber mig att stanna
Går jag hem så ringer du till någon annan
Kan inte, får inte sakna dig
Ändå är det dig jag tänker på
Såklart det blir fel i bland
Speciellt när vi ser varann, med nån annan
Du vill ha nåt som håller i längden
Men du vet att vi gjorde det bättre
Går därifrån för jag kan inte se dig

Nu står vi här, hur fan gör vi nu?
När alla vår lögner är slut
Och det vi håller på med är sjukt
Men ingen annan rör mig som du
Nej, ingen annan rör mig som du

Jag vill inte ta på dig, va med dig
Jag vill bara ta på dig, va med mig
Lilla baby, känns det ensamt nu?
Jag kan ångra ibland att vi fucka ur
Vi ser inte solen
Ingen sand mellan tårna
Ingen fucking semester
Men vi vill inte jobba
Det känns som vi går där med ångest
Tillsammans och väntar på sommar'n
Vem bryr sig om vintern, om våren, om hösten?
Det funkar på sommar'n
Vi bråkar, vi skriker, vi knullar, vi blundar
Tillsammans och somnar

Är att jag inte känner som du

Know you're no good for me
I think I need you anyway
We meet, have sex in between
You call your ex in between, what the hell is going on?
Both probably know we're seeing other people
But we close our eyes when we do it with each other
Accept when you ask me to stay
If I go home, you call someone else
Can't, can't miss you
Still, it's you I'm thinking about
Of course there will be mistakes in between
Especially when we see each other, with someone else
You want something that will last
But you know we did better
Leaving because I can't see you

Now we stand here, what the hell do we do now?
When all our lies are over
And what we are doing is sick
But no one else touches me like you
No, no one else touches me like you

I don't want to touch you, what with you
I just want to touch you, come with me
Little baby, feeling lonely now?
I can regret sometimes that we fuck off
We don't see the sun
No sand between your toes
No fucking vacation
But we don't want to work
It feels like we go there with anxiety
Together and waiting for summer
Who cares about winter, about spring, about autumn?
It works in the summer
We fight, we scream, we fuck, we close our eyes
Together and falling asleep
But when will we wake up?

Min bleka kind är svart av smink
Hör hela huset sova tungt
Finns inget jag behöver som är nån annanstans
Jag skulle kunna dö nu, med kinden mot din hals
Jag reser mig ur våran säng
Lämnar dig sovande, min vän
Jag smyger över golvet, ser solen stiga upp
I samma stund så vet jag att allting har ett slut

Allt är för bra nu
Går runt i T-shirt och är trött
Sitter på pianot mellan flaskor, glas och fimpar
Blundar tills jag skymtar lyckan och jag vet
Allt är för bra nu
Allt är bra nu

Festen har dött för längesen
Soffan har blivit till en säng
Jag lånar någons stövlar i storlek fyrtiofem
Går ut igenom dörren och där är sommaren
I gräset sover någon än
Ser ganska obekvämt ut men
Jag knäpper några bilder och skrattar för mig själv
I samma stund så vet jag att allting har ett slut

My pale cheek is black with makeup
Hear the whole house sound asleep
There is nothing I need that is somewhere else
I could die now, with my cheek against your neck
I get up from our bed
Leaving you sleeping, my friend
I sneak across the floor, watch the sun rise
At the same moment, I know that everything has an end

Everything is too good now
Walking around in a T-shirt and being tired
Sitting on the piano among bottles, glasses and farts
Closing my eyes until I glimpse happiness and I know
Everything is too good now
Everything is good now

The party died a long time ago
The sofa has become a bed
I'm borrowing someone's size forty-five boots
Walk out the door and there is summer
Someone is still sleeping in the grass
Looks pretty uncomfortable though
I snap a few pictures and laugh to myself

Ooh, I can't get enough
You know you could tear me apart
Put me back together and take my heart
I never thought that I could love this hard
Ooh, I can't get enough
Mmm, you got me feelin' like

I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like I'm
Like my soul's on fire, I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singin' like

Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
And we'll say, ""Ooh, I love it when you do it like that""
And when you're close up, give me the shivers

I know you moved onto someone new
Hope life is beautiful
You were the light for me to find my truth
I just wanna say, thank you

Leaving to find my soul
Told her I had to go
And I know it ain't pretty
When our hearts get broke
Too young to feel this old
Watching us both turn cold
Oh, I know it ain't pretty
When two hearts get broke
Yeah, I know it ain't pretty
When two hearts get broke

I hope someday we'll sit down together
And laugh with each other about these days, these days
All our troubles, we'll lay to rest and
We'll wish we could come back to these days, these days

Oh, I know, I know

Three years of ups and downs
Nothing to show for it now
And I know it ain't pretty when the fire burns out
Calling me when I'm drunk, remind me of what I've done
And I know it ain't pretty when you're trying to move on, yeah

I hope someday we'll sit down together
And laugh with each other about these days, these days
All our troubles, we'll lay to rest and

To these days, these days, oh

Cigarettes in the ashtray
Reminiscing on those past days
I thought you’d end up with my last name
But that changed
And I travelled around the world
Think where you living at now?
I heard you moved to Austin
Got an apartment and settled down
And every once in a while, I start texting
Write a paragraph, but then I delete the message
Think about you like a past time
I could cry you a river, get you baptized or
I wasn't ready to act right
Used to always think I'd get you back, right
They say that things fall apart
We were gonna move to Brooklyn
You were gonna study art
Love is just a tool
To remind us who we are
And that we are not alone
When we're walking in the dark
I hope someday we'll sit down together
And laugh with each other about these days, these days
All our troubles, we'll lay to rest and
We'll wish we could come back to these days, these days

Jag trodde änglarna fanns bara, bara i himmelen
Jag trodde änglarna fanns bara, bara i himmelen
Men det var innan jag mötte dig
Nu har jag en ängel här hos mig

Det var en helt vanlig dag
Men just den dan mötte jag
Den jag trodde aldrig fanns
I min värld någonstans

Jag trodde änglarna fanns bara, bara i himmelen
Jag trodde änglarna fanns bara, bara i himmelen
Men det var innan jag mötte dig
Nu har jag en ängel här hos mig

Over grensa møtte je
For å finne sjelefred
Og nå føler jeg meg hel
Du er min tvillingsjel

I thought angels only existed, only in heaven
I thought angels only existed, only in heaven
But that was before I met you
Now I have an angel here with me

It was a perfectly normal day
But that particular day I met
The one I thought never existed
In my world somewhere

I thought angels only existed, only in heaven
I thought angels only existed, only in heaven
But that was before I met you
Now I have an angel here with me

Across the border met you
To find peace of mind
And now I feel whole
You are my twin soul

Oh, woah, oh
Oh, oh

You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we will make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothing to prove
You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been working at a convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
We won't have to drive too far
Just across the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way
You might also like
So I remember we were driving, driving in your car
The speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
And I, I had a feeling that I could be someone
Had a feeling that I could be someone

You see, my old man's got a problem
He lives with the bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
I say, his body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did
You got a fast car
And we go cruising to entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way

So I remember we were driving, driving in your car
The speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk

And I, I had a feeling that I belonged

89,89,89,Hov1,Barn av vår tid,"35 ContributorsTranslationsEnglishBarn av vår tid Lyrics
De vill ha mer än en miljon på banken
Alla röstar rött men hatar ändå skatten
Ingen vill bestämma men alla vill ha makten
Några bor i stan men de kallar det för trakten
Jag är likadan men jag sätter mina chanser
Ingen kommer in, ""Nej, va? Jag känner vakten""
Inget är försent men försöker vara tapper
Dricker bara rent, ingen mjölk i mitt kaffe
Min kompis är förlorad, han har snortat upp en årslön
Nu står svarta bilar utanför honom på natten
Alla går med cykelbyxor nu på festivaler
Alla jagar följare men vem ska leda packet?
Är jag bättrе själv? Kör för fort bakom ratten
Kysst varenda tjej snart i Stockholm som är vackеr
Kan knappt gå ut, måste se mig över axeln
Hela stan vaknar innan jag har gått och lagt mig

Jag är ett barn av vår tid, skulle jag bryta mig fri
Var att bo i andra hand mitt enda alternativ
Jag bodde uppe hos nån, nästan som kollektiv
Och våra grannar från Italien, de drack för mycket vin
Står med fötterna på, känner marken är hård
Ångrar att jag inte drack varannan vatten igår
Men vad spelar det för roll nu när det regnar on the Southside?
Nu hör jag grannen spela Primetime

Jag har en vän som hävdar att han vet vad kärlek är
Men han prenumererade på klamydiabrev
Och varje onsdag gick han ut och då med säkerhet
Så vakna han upp varje torsdag utan—
Här har ingen känt nån men
Alla är din bästa vän
Tills de kastar dig till gamarna
För att hugga dig i ryggen sen
Men alla vill va VD, ingen vill till BB
Alla skriver ""Horungebarn"" i sitt CV
Alla vill va äkta, pojkarna gör snedsteg
Någon köper sex och han gråter ut i TV

Jag är ett barn av vår tid, är fylld av idioti
Jag kanske skjuter upp en skola eller tar jag mitt liv
Jag kanske reser iväg för att rena min själ
Och jag skiter i det ni kallar koldioxid
Och jag letar ibland, jag blir smetad ibland
Jag borde flytta någonstans där ingen kunde mitt namn
Så vad spelar det för roll nu när det regnar on the Westside?
Det kommer alltid va det best life

Ingen vill ju upp men jobb är inte valfritt
Alla vill bli fulla men ingen vill bli bakis
Alla vill bo stort men inte stort i Bagis
Alla vill bli stjärnor men ingen vill va känd
Här vill ingen leva men ingen som vill dö
Ingen vill gå in om de måste stå i kö
Ingen som vill jobba för nån men ha en lön
Minst lika stor som en bankdirektör
De går till samma ställen, varje helg, det samma fester
De knullar samma folk och ringer till varandra efter
Och deras jobb är att de åker på betald semester
Med samma folk de pratar illa om på toaletten
Låt mig förklara en sak, du har så bra ideal
När alla kollar är du fenomenal
Behandlar vännen ifrån orten som en accessoar
Och sjunger n-ordet på festen när du festar privat
De gillar ketamin och kokain och massa tjack
Har ADHD men de kallar det för superkraft
De talar ut om det och plötsligt får de bokkontrakt
Det måste vara svårt att kriga för va relevant
För alla hugger alla här till vänster och det går
Så respekt till er som pluggar komvux eller KTH
Ingen kommer rädda världen för att vinsten är för låg
Så de kapitaliserar på sin dotter eller son

Jag är ett barn av vår tid, tar ett lån på kredit
Jag köper riktigt dyra kläder och belånar min bil
Jag kanske sviker en vän för att få gå på event
Fläta håret och jag ser inte nån problematik
Står med fötterna på, känner marken är hård
Jag vill inte ha nåt barn men bangar ändå kondom
Så i samarbete med varenda jävel som ni känner
Borde ni checka era vänner
Ingen vill ge upp men ingen som vill jobba
Sitter i direktsändning, pratar ut med torskar
Killarna gör gang signs fast de bor i Bromma
Den här går ut till Sverige, välkommen till Stockholm
Här dansar vi till kvinnoförnedrande musik
De cancelar nog sin mamma ifall det ger trafik
De pratar med polisen men låtsas va en G
Jag skäms för vem jag är, jag är ett barn av vår tid4Embed","35 ContributorsTranslationsEnglishChildren of our time Lyrics
They want more than a million in the bank
Everyone votes red but still hates the tax
No one wants to decide but everyone wants the power
Some live in town but they call it the area
I'm the same but I take my chances
Nobody comes in, ""No, huh? I know the guard""
Nothing is late but try to be brave
Only drink straight, no milk in my coffee
My friend is lost, he has snorted up a year's salary
Now black cars stand outside him at night
Everyone wears cycling pants now at festivals
Everyone is chasing followers but who will lead the pack?
Am I better myself? Driving too fast behind the wheel
Kiss every single girl in Stockholm soon who is beautiful
Can hardly go out, have to look over my shoulder
The whole town wakes up before I've gone to bed

I am a child of our time, I would break free
Where to live second hand my only option
I lived upstairs with someone, almost as a collective
And our neighbors from Italy, they drank too much wine
Standing with feet on, feels the ground is hard
Regret not drinking every other water yesterday
But what does it matter now that it's raining on the Southside?
Now I hear the neighbor playing Primetime
You might also like
I have a friend who claims he knows what love is
But he subscribed to chlamydia letters
And every Wednesday he went out and then with certainty
So he wakes up every Thursday without—
No one here has known anyone but
Everyone is your best friend
Until they throw you to the vultures
To stab you in the back later
But everyone wants to be CEO, no one wants to be BB
Everyone writes ""Horungebarn"" in their CV
Everyone wants to be real, the boys slip up
Someone buys sex and he cries on TV

I am a child of our time, full of idiocy
Maybe I'll put off school or I'll kill myself
I might travel away to cleanse my soul
And I don't care about what you call carbon dioxide
And I search sometimes, I get smeared sometimes
I should move somewhere where no one knew my name
So what does it matter now that it's raining on the Westside?
It will always be the best life

Nobody wants to quit, but work is not optional
Everyone wants to get drunk, but no one wants to get drunk
Everyone wants to live big but not big in Bagis
Everyone wants to be a star, but no one wants to be famous
No one wants to live here, but no one wants to die
No one wants to go in if they have to stand in line
No one wants to work for someone but have a salary
At least as big as a bank manager
They go to the same places, every weekend, the same parties
They fuck the same people and call each other after
And their job is to go on paid vacation
With the same people they talk bad about in the toilet
Let me explain one thing, you have such good ideals
When everyone's checking, you're phenomenal
Treats the friend from the resort as an accessory
And singing the n-word at the party when you're partying privately
They like ketamine and cocaine and lots of shit
Has ADHD but they call it a superpower
They talk about it and suddenly they get a book contract
It must be hard to fight to be relevant
Because everyone cuts here to the left and it works
So respect to those of you studying komvux or KTH
No one will save the world because the profit is too low
So they capitalize on their daughter or son

I am a child of our time, take a loan on credit
I buy really expensive clothes and mortgage my car
I might let a friend down to go to an event
Braid the hair and I don't see any problems
Standing with feet on, feels the ground is hard
I don't want to have any children, but still bang a condom
So in collaboration with every single bastard you know
You should check your friends
No one wants to give up but no one wants to work
Sitting on live broadcast, talking to cods
The guys make gang signs even though they live in Bromma
This one goes out to Sweden, welcome to Stockholm
Here we dance to music that degrades women
They probably cancel their mother if it brings traffic
They talk to the police but pretend to be a G

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look at the five and ten
It's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

A pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

Sure it's Christmas once more5Embed","42 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçeIt’s Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas Lyrics

Ah
Jag blir din hiphop, är du min R&B?
Yeah

50 hade tjugoen frågor, jag har hundra
Vem är du till att börja med, och varför just jag?
I got ninety-nine problems som inte går att lösa på ett tag
Kan det va mitt sätt att va?
Min bakgrund? Är det för att jag rappar?
Du är en bra tjej från en bra familj så håll dig till bra grabbar
Jag förstår dig på ett sätt, det ändå komplicerat
De säger motsatsen attraherar
Jag ska inte ljuga, du är attraktiv
Du har ett leende som går att vakna upp till varje dag
Men kommer den va kvar när du inser
Hur mycket bullshit jag vaknar upp till varje dag?
Jag vet du gör musik, ditt namn är aktuellt
Och jag hört du är begåvad, intellektuell
Vad läser du för böcker, har du någon favorit?
Du citerar Maya Angelou, gillar du poesi?

Hej, sho, hur mår du? Är det bra?
Jag känner att det är med dig jag vill va
Våra demoner verkar klicka, de har funnit en kemi
Så om jag blir din hiphop, är du min R&B?

Jag vet att de drar i dig, men du valde att dra i mig (Yeah, yeah)
Jag vet att de drar i dig, men du valde att dra i mig (Oh yeah)
Jag skulle ljuga om jag sa att jag inte dras till dig
Med dig, jag mår bra till mig (Yeah, yeah)
Jag vet att de drar i dig, men du valde att dra i mig

Vanligtvis jag brukar alltid vara han som flyr
Men du gör det svårt för mig att hålla händerna i styr
Du ser alldeles för bra ut i din klänning
Det är första gången men du känns inte som en främling
Sanningen är den, jag har inte råd med diamanter
Men däremot kan du få en massa komplimanger
Jag vet att du hört en hel del om mig
Jag är bra kille, baby, de har fel om mig
Ey, får jag bjuda dig på middag eller nåt?
Det blir alltid bra stämning när man äter något gott
Eller vi kan bara promenera mellan husen
Fan, lite frisk luft skulle göra susen

Sho, hur mår du? Är det bra?
Jag känner att det är med dig jag vill va
Våra demoner verkar klicka, de har funnit en kemi
Så om jag blir din hiphop, är du min R&B?
Jag vet att de drar i dig, men du valde att dra i mig (Yeah, yeah)

Ah
I'll be your hip hop, you my R&B?
Yeah

50 had twenty one questions, I have a hundred
Who are you to begin with, and why me?
I got ninety-nine problems that cannot be solved for a while
Could it be my way of being?
My background? Is it because I rap?
You are a good girl from a good family so stick to good guys
I understand you in a way, it's still complicated
They say opposites attract
I'm not going to lie, you're attractive
You have a smile that you can wake up to every day
But it will remain when you realize
How much bullshit do I wake up to every day?
I know you make music, your name is current
And I heard you are talented, intellectual
What kind of books do you read, do you have a favorite?
You quote Maya Angelou, do you like poetry?

Hi, sho, how are you? Is it good?
I feel that it is with you that I want to be
Our demons seem to click, they have found a chemistry
So if I be your hip hop, you be my R&B?

I know they pull you, but you chose to pull me (Yeah, yeah)
I know they pull you, but you chose to pull me (Oh yeah)
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't drawn to you
With you, I feel good (Yeah, yeah)
I know they pull you, but you chose to pull me

Usually I'm always the one who runs away
But you make it hard for me to keep my hands in check
You look way too good in your dress
It's the first time but you don't feel like a stranger
The truth is, I can't afford diamonds
But on the other hand, you can get a lot of compliments
I know you've heard a lot about me
I'm a good guy, baby, they got me wrong
Ey, can I take you to dinner or something?
There is always a good atmosphere when you eat something good
Or we can just walk between the houses
Heck, some fresh air would do the trick

Sho, how are you? Is it good?
I feel that it is with you that I want to be
Our demons seem to click, they have found a chemistry
So if I be your hip hop, you be my R&B?

Everybody gets high sometimes, you know
What else can we do when we're feelin' low?
So take a deep breath and let it go

And if you feel you're sinking, I will jump right over
Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know...

I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight

'Cause we all get lost sometimes, you know?

Get 'em; what it is? What it does? What it is? What it isn't?
Looking for a better way to get up outta bed
Instead of getting on the Internet
And checking on who hit me, get up
Thrift shop, pimp-strut walkin'
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Sweater game, nope, nope, y'all can't copy, yeah
Bad, moonwalking, this here is our party
My posse's been on Broadway, and we did it our way
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones
Into everything I record to it and yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit, hustlin'
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen
With the four-track, bussin'

Min första hette Erik och för honom kunde jag dö
Tills jag fick veta att han hade fyra andra
Då träffa jag Fredrik, han var snäll men alltid så hög
Han åkte dit sen för han smuggla ladd från Danmark
Så jag grät en skvätt men inte mer
Lärde mig tidigt att om det finns en så finns det fler
Jag känner ingen bitterhet, nej, så du vet

Så vill jag tacka för all ångest och dåliga hångel
Ja, tack för alla gånger som det blev så fel
Jag känner inte någon ånger för det blev ju sånger
Och fler erfarenheter som gör att jag ser
Att trots att vi nog aldrig var menade för varandra
Ja, trots att det var misstag som ledde mig hit
Så vill jag tacka för all ångest och dåliga hångel
Gör att jag nu vet
Att jag är värd så mycket mer

Andreas var så trasig, bodde på ett behandlingshem
Och jag kan ofta undra hur det gick för honom sen
Så har vi Tommy och jag hade det nog på känn
Så jag blev inte chockad när han sa han gillar män
Jag känner ingen bitterhet, nej, så du vet

Och tack till Per i synnerhet, du lärde mig att jag nu vet
Om svartsjuka och otrohet, för du var jäkligt bra på det
Jag hoppas du har mognat, reflekterat, att du växt
För du var värst av mina ex

Trots att vi nog aldrig var menade för varandra
Ja, trots att det var misstag som ledde mig hit
Så vill jag tacka för all ångest och dåliga hångel
Gör att jag nu vet
Att jag är värd så mycket merEmbed","5 ContributorsX Lyrics
My first was called Erik and I could die for him
Until I learned he had four others
Then I met Fredrik, he was kind but always so loud
He went there later because he smuggled loads from Denmark
So I cried a little but no more
Learned early that if there is one, there are more
I feel no bitterness, no, so you know

So I want to thank you for all the anxiety and bad thoughts
Yes, thanks for all the times it got so wrong
I don't feel any regret because they were songs
And more experiences that make me see
That despite the fact that we were probably never meant for each other
Yes, even though it was mistakes that led me here
So I want to thank you for all the anxiety and bad thoughts
Makes me now know
That I am worth so much more

Andreas was so broken, lived in a treatment home
And I can often wonder how things went for him afterwards
Then we have Tommy and I probably knew it
So I wasn't shocked when he said he likes men
I feel no bitterness, no, so you know

So I want to thank you for all the anxiety and bad thoughts
Yes, thanks for all the times it got so wrong
I don't feel any regret because they were songs
And more experiences that make me see

Yes, even though it was mistakes that led me here
So I want to thank you for all the anxiety and bad thoughts
Makes me now know
That I am worth so much more
So I want to thank you for that, whoa

And thanks to Per in particular, you taught me what I now know
About jealousy and infidelity, because you were damn good at it
I hope you have matured, reflected, that you have grown
Because you were the worst of my exes

Even though we were probably never meant for each other
Yes, even though it was mistakes that led me here
So I want to thank you for all the anxiety and bad thoughts
Makes me now know

Oh, alla pengar som jag haft

Och allt det dumma som jag sagt
Det vill jag inte minnas mer
Så låt oss ta ett avskedsglas

Och alla älskare jag kysst
De önskar nog jag stannat kvar
En stöter ut, en lägger vid
Och livet tar och livet ger
Jag går min väg, men stanna ni
Godnatt, må glädjen lysa er


Oh, om jag haft ännu en slant
Och en till chans att stanna kvar

And all the lovers I kiss

Det var ett tag sen jag följde av
Ville visa att jag mår bra
Tur att du inte är privat
För jag kollar ju varje dag
Mina vänner säger ""Följ med ut""
Ja, de säger ""Det behöver du""
Det kommer aldrig bli som förut
För hon blev ju din till slut

Alla blir för henne svag
Allt du nånsin velat ha
Och mycket sötare än jag
Men är hon bra för dig?
Är hon bra för dig?
Jag ser ju er ibland
När du håller hennes hand
Känns som om jag aldrig fanns
Men är hon bra för dig?
Är hon bra för dig?

Det gjorde ont när jag gjorde slut
Har aldrig gråtit så förut
När jag såg dig gå itu
Men jag är kär i en annan nu
Det är svårt att få skit från dina vänner
Men jag kan inte hjälpa hur jag känner
Jag gick vidare och jag vet det va
Kanske lite väl fort

Hur ska jag komma över dig?
Du kommer komma över mig
Vi känner samma känslor
Men inte samma sak
Jag kommer alltid älska dig
Men du vill ju inte va med mig
Faller sönder i tusen bitar

It's been a while since I followed
Wanted to show that I'm fine
Good thing you're not private
Because I check every day
My friends say ""Follow me out""
Yes, they say ""You need it""
It will never be the same
Because she became yours in the end

Everyone becomes weak to her
Everything you ever wanted
And much cuter than me
But is she good for you?
Is she good for you?
I see you sometimes
When you hold her hand
Feels like I never existed
But is she good for you?
Is she good for you?

It hurt when I finished
Never cried like that before
When I saw you go away
But I'm in love with someone else now
It's hard to get crap from your friends
But I can't help how I feel
I moved on and I know it
Maybe a little too fast

Luder, vem är det som dricker mest?
Jag kan se att du vill ha mig
Dalmål-brudar, de är alltid bäst
Rid mig som en dalahäst

För jag kan faktiskt se dig
När du rullar fram i Chevan din utan någon skam
Jag kan rida dig som i Dalarna, i skogarna, som i sagorna
För du är en riktig viking
Du och jag kan ligga nu i din bil
Hela staden, de får höra mitt skrik

Säg mig luder, vem är det som dricker mest?
Jag kan se att du vill ha mig
Dalmål-brudar, de är alltid bäst
Rid mig som en dalahäst
Säg mig fuckboy, vem är det som leker mest?
För jag kan se hur du vill ha mig
Raggare, ja de är alltid bäst
Rider dig som en dalahäst

Jag kan faktiskt se dig när du super loss
På snap-storyn, som en riktig boss
Jag vill ha dig i mitt umgänge i Borlänge
Nu rinner det, för du är ett riktigt luder
Du hukar dig ner och bara sugеr
Jag tar fram nå't, kan jag bjuder

Ride me like a valley horse

Because I can actually see you
When you roll forward in your Chevan without any shame
I can ride you like in the valleys, in the forests, like in the fairy tales
Because you are a real Viking
You and I can lie now in your car
The whole town, they'll hear my scream

Tell me bitch, who drinks the most?

Because I can see how you want me

(Hey) Once upon a younger year
When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside came out to play
(Hey) Hey, went face to face with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Made memories we knew would never fade

One day my father he told me
""Son, don't let it slip away""
He took me in his arms, I heard him say (Hey)
""When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid""

So live a life you will remember""

Jag har förlorat mig i dig
Dags att ge upp igen

Jag har förlorat mig i dig
Dags att ge upp igen
Det är dags att ge upp igen
Finns ingen som säger sanningen
Det ser snyggt ut väldigt långt ifrån
Men allt är fult på nära håll

Den vita dansösen tar betalt när hon ska dansa
Djävulen i Louis Vuitton, hon kysser mig på franska
Samvetets opium, vodkan släcker törsten
Jag spelar in i studion tills jag tappar rösten
Munnen har en kassa, deras lögner står i kö
Du vet vad som sägs om det som göms i snö
Fin på utsidorna men väldigt ful i munnen
Hon blev kär i den fula ankungen
Stressade sportbilar, 7.62 gånger trettio
Philipp Plein på Giuseppes, svaghеt för logotyper
Förr jag hade vatten övеr huvet, nu jag flyter
Som glöden på min cigarett Camorrans barn ryker
Tillitsproblem gör det svårt för han att älska
Isbitarna på klockan kan aldrig bli till vätska
Där solen aldrig skiner är vi som lyktor
Hon lämnar en brottsplats fylld med tomma hylsor

Jag har förlorat mig i dig
Dags att ge upp igen
Det är dags att ge upp igen
Finns ingen som säger sanningen
Det ser snyggt ut väldigt långt ifrån
Men allt är fult på nära håll

Jag såg några färger på himmelen
Jag är tillbaks igen
Men det är du som ligger vaken
Med demoner under sängen
Ensam med striden, ensam med orden
Kniven mot strupen, förlorar en broder
Såg alla färger du håller tillbaks
Du flyr verkligheten och vill inte vakna

Han växte upp i en tuff klimat
Ville han ha nåt, han var tvungen att ta
Det må va jobbigt, men för han det normalt
En flugas död, det är en spindels mat
Han växte upp i en tuff klimat
Ville han ha nåt, han var tvungen att ta

Det är dags att ge upp igen

I have lost myself in you
Time to give up again

I have lost myself in you
Time to give up again
It's time to give up again
There is no one who tells the truth
It looks nice from very far
But everything is ugly up close

The white dancer charges when she dances
The devil in Louis Vuitton, she kisses me in French
The opium of conscience, vodka quenches thirst
I record in the studio until I lose my voice
The mouth has a till, their lies are lined up
You know what they say about what's hidden in the snow
Nice on the outside but very ugly in the mouth
She fell in love with the ugly duckling
Stressed sports cars, 7.62 times thirty
Philipp Plein at Giuseppes, weakness for logos
Before I had water over my head, now I float
Like the embers of my cigarette Camorran's children smoke
Trust issues make it hard for him to love
The ice cubes on the watch can never turn into liquid
Where the sun never shines, we are like lanterns
She leaves a crime scene filled with empty shell casings

Time to give up again
It's time to give up again
There is no one who tells the truth
It looks nice from very far
But everything is ugly up close

I saw some colors in the sky
I'm back again
But you are the one lying awake
With demons under the bed
Alone with the battle, alone with the words
The knife to the throat, losing a brother
Saw all the colors you hold back
You escape reality and don't want to wake up

He grew up in a tough climate
If he wanted something, he had to take it
It must be hard, but he does it normally
A fly's death, it's a spider's food
He grew up in a tough climate
If he wanted something, he had to take it
It must be hard, but he does it normally
A fly's death, it's a spider's food
Lost me in you
Time to give up again
It's time to give up again
There is no one who tells the truth

'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But somethin' told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (See you in a better place)

A special bond of creation, ha

She works the nights by the water
She's gone astray, so far away
From her father's daughter
She just wants a life for her baby
All on her own, no one will come
She's got to save him (Daily struggle)

She tells him, ""Ooh, love
No one's ever gonna hurt you, love
I'm gonna give you all of my love
Nobody matters like you"" (Stay up there, stay up there)

Look around, was this what we dreamed
Dreamed, is it something, something we forgot
Forgotten, were we, a planet filled with humanity
All my life, I've been trying to ask
Ask and get an answer

It's time to start rethinking because time is running out
Out it might run out soon, and I know it will
We are building now, it will one day be what our children will have
Oh-oh, oh-oh (There is no other answer)
Oh-oh, oh-oh (The questions that I have)
Oh-oh, oh-oh (There is no other answer)
I want so badly

A belief in the future, a belief in the truth
A belief in community, sometime (Sometime), somewhere (Somewhere)
Someday

Oh tell me, oh tell me, oh tell me, oh tell me where we stand

Oh tell me, oh tell me, oh tell me, oh tell me where we stand

I walked in the corner with the body screaming dolo
Never sold a bag but look like Pablo in a photo
This gon' make 'em feel the way like Tony killed Manolo
You already know though, you already know though
I walk in the corner with the money, on my finger
She might get it popping, I might wife her for the winter
I already know, already know, nigga roses
All I need is roses

Turn up baby, turn up, when I turn it on
You know how I get too lit when I turn it on
Can't handle my behavior when I turn it on
Too fast, never ask, if the life don't last
Done been through it all
Fuck with a nigga raw, this who you wanna be
And I know you won't tell nobody nothing
And I know you won't tell nobody no

I might pull up flexing on these niggas like aerobics
I might tell her girl you cute but balling

Standing on the table, Rosé, Rosé, fuck the waters

Usually, I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today, I see our reflections clearly

You need somethin' I can never give

Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I say goodbye

Don't you ever try to do me wrong
Ännu starkare lampor har släckts för sånt
Ville ha mer än Louis Vuitton
Sprang runt i Gore-Tex, sena nätter ingen sömn
Ey, jag sa, ""Visst det är trapping"", visste redan hur det go down
Men det ännu större pris, if I make it out
They wanna pay for more
Det bevis, på det viset att vi ej som dom
Vi leva life for life, se life from a Rollie
Tiden är trap, I still wanna roll it
Långt innan centrum blev till ett väntrum
Hade drömmar om att ta mig långt

Sa till henne, ""Gumman, vi ba vänner nu
Det är slut på snacket, vi byter ämne nu""
Hon kollade på mig och sa, ""Vem är du?"" Vem fan är du?
Här det vänder snabbt
Free min broder, han som ni hann ikapp
Inte bra för miljön, mannen, ni är värre än plast
Folket här ute, de är kallare än glass
Po-polisen undrar om vi sett nåt, ingen sagt nåt
Det bland det första som man lär sig här i slummen
Vi inte som er, ni inte som oss
När vi steppar in du vet att det blir trubbel

Honestly, I never ever was like anyone, it's true

And I can start with it is common to earn black

Don't you ever try to do me wrong
Even brighter lights have been turned off for that sort of thing
Wanted more than Louis Vuitton
Ran around in Gore-Tex, late nights no sleep
Ey, I said, ""Sure it's trapping"", already knew how it go down
But the even bigger price, if I make it out
They want to pay for more
That proof, in that way, that we are not like them

I ain't tryna tell you what to do
But try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playin' by your rules
Everything look better with a view, yeah

I could never get attached
When I start to feel, I unattach
Somehow I always end up feelin' bad
Baby, I am not your dad
It's not all you want from me
I just want your company
Girl, it's obvious, elephant in the room
And we're a part of it, don't act so confused
And you love startin' it, now I'm in a mood
Now we arguin' in my bedroom

When you could be blowin' up just like my cellular?
I won't ever let a shorty go and set me up
Only thing I need to know is if you wet enough
I'm talkin' slick back, kick back, gang sippin' forties
You keep playin', not another day with you, shorty
Mismatched fits, that was way before you know me
Got a lot of love, well, you better save it for me

Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me
Don't pull up at 6 AM to cuddle with me
You know how I like it when you lovin' on me

Woo, woo
I pull up like
How you pull up, Baby? How you pull up? (Oh, oh, oh)
How you pull up? I pull up (Woo, SethInTheKitchen)

Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar? (Yeah)
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (Woo)
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me (Woo)
You better let me go the day you need me (Woo)
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (Woo)
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop

It's safe to say I earned it, ain't a nigga gave me nothin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm ready to hop out on a nigga, get to bustin'
Know you heard me say, ""You play, you lay,"" don't make me push the button
Full of pain, dropped enough tears to fill up a fuckin' bucket
Goin' for buckets, I bought a chopper
I got a big drum, it hold a hundred, ain't goin' for nothin'
I'm ready to air it out on all these niggas, I can see 'em runnin'
Just talked to my mama, she hit me on FaceTime just to check up on me and my brother
I'm really the baby, she know that her youngest son was always guaranteed to get the money (Okay, let's go)
She know that her baby boy was always guaranteed to get the loot
She know what I do, she know 'fore I run from a nigga, I'ma pull it out and shoot (Boom)
PTSD, I'm always waking up in cold sweats like I got the flu
My daughter a G, she saw me kill a nigga in front of her before the age of two
And I'll kill another nigga too
'Fore I let another nigga do somethin' to you
Long as you know that, don't let nobody tell you different
Daddy love you (Yeah, yeah)

Keep a Glocky when I ride in the Suburban

I got the mop, watch me wash 'em like detergent
And I'm ballin', that's why it's diamonds on my jersey
Slide on opps' side and flip the block back, yeah, yeah
My junior popped him and left him lopsided, yeah, yeah
We spin his block, got the rebound, Dennis Rodman
Fool me one time, you can't cross me again
Twelve hundred horsepower, I get lost in the wind
If he talkin' on the yard, the pen' dogs'll take his chin
Maybach SUV for my refugees
Buy blocks in the hood, put money in the streets
I was solo when the opps caught me at the gas station
Had it on me, thirty thousand, thought it was my last day
But they ain't even want no smoke
If I had to choose it, murder what she wrote

Det är nåt som vi tappat
Nåt jag inte förstår nu
Säger först att du skrattar
Men den sekunden så går du
Sa du skulle bli bättre
Kan ändå inte nå dig
Leker du aldrig sett mig
Ändå skriker du på mig

Du lever i din egna värld
Du svävar där bland moln
Och gömmer dina sår för mig nu
Men ge mig allting som du bär
Sluta gör det svårt
Bara låt det gå

För jag är här, så nära dig nu
Så låt min själ få bära dig nu
Säg som det är
Om du ska lämna mig nu

Det är nåt som vi tappat
Nåt jag inte förstår nu
Säger först att du skrattar
Men den sekunden så går du
Sa du skulle bli bättre
Kan ändå inte nå dig

It's something we've lost
Something I don't understand now
First say you laugh
But that second you leave
Said you would get better
Still can't reach you
Play you've never seen me
Yet you yell at me

You live in your own world
You are floating there among clouds
And hiding your wounds from me now
But give me everything that you wear
Stop making it difficult
Just let it go

Because I am here, so close to you now
So let my soul carry you now
Say it like it is
If you're going to leave me now

It's something we've lost

The only thing we care about is becoming great

We were in Stockholm for a week, wanted to get some ink
We bought the same t-shirt and thought we were cheeky
We googled spy bar, we had received grants
Thought it would be fun to get crazy in a new city
But when we were going in, ask the guard for a list
I don't understand anything, it's probably something I'm missing
I wait until he looks away then I ran into the bar
They suggest a drink (And I answer that I'll take it)

Så, ey
Låt mig vara din soldat, ey
Låt mig vara din soldat
Låt mig vara din soldat

Har du också tänkt sista gången
Och gjort samma miss om och om sen?
Har du också legat vaken hela nätter
Panik, massa press, pressat tänder?
Har du också lovat dig själv
Att imorgon tar jag tag i mig själv?
Har du också provat deras norm
Sen fattat att du inte är som dom?
Har du också satt dig i en bil
Bara kört tills du inte har bensin?
Har du också tänkt om jag flyr
Kommer allting bli bra inuti?
Har du också fattat till slut
Att den enda som kan rädda dig är du?
Du behöver inte bära allt själv
För jag har känt allt precis som du känt

Jag har sett hur den där skiten alltid tär på dig
Jag kommer kriga för din skull och finnas där för dig
När du stupar nästa gång så vill jag bära dig
Låt mig vara din soldat
Jag har sett hur den där skiten alltid tär på dig
Jag kommer kriga för din skull och finnas där för dig
När du stupar nästa gång så vill jag bära dig

Har du också kört huvudet i väggen
Så hårt att det känts som du sprängt det?
Har du också svurit att aldrig
Ge upp det du drömt och sett fram till?
Har du också stått på ditt jobb
Sen känt du är värd mer än så?
Har du också stressat ihjäl dig
För en lön som knappt gör din själ nöjd?
Jag har också tappat ibland
Och snabbt försökt komma ikapp
Jag har också sett när du faller
Och försökt bygga nytt ifrån marken
Jag har också vart nära min gräns
Så jag fattar precis hur det känns
Men jag lovar att allt kommer vända
Om vi lovar att tro på oss själva

Jag har sett hur den där skiten alltid tär på dig
Jag kommer kriga för din skull och finnas där för dig
När du stupar nästa gång så vill jag bära dig
Låt mig vara din soldat
Jag har sett hur den där skiten alltid tär på dig
Jag kommer kriga för din skull och finnas där för dig
När du stupar nästa gång så vill jag bära dig
Låt mig vara din soldat
För dem pekar, blickar in oss
Vinkar hitåt, måste bli nått
Skapar normer, väcker sorger
Bygger luftslott utav ångest
Informerar, propagerar
Ger oss manus för att leva
Så vi blundar för det skeva
Men om vi vågar kan vi segra

Jag har sett hur den där skiten alltid tär på dig
Jag kommer kriga för din skull och finnas där för dig
När du stupar nästa gång så vill jag bära dig
Låt mig vara din soldat
Jag har sett hur den där skiten alltid tär på dig

So, eh
Let me be your soldier, ey
Let me be your soldier
Let me be your soldier

Did you also think the last time
And made the same mistake over and over again?
Have you also been up all night?
Panic, lots of pressure, clenched teeth?
Have you also promised yourself
That tomorrow I will catch myself?
Have you also tried their norm
Then realized that you are not like them?
Have you also sat in a car
Just drive until you run out of gas?
Have you also thought if I run away?
Will everything be fine inside?
Have you finally figured it out too?
That the only one who can save you is you?
You don't have to carry everything yourself
Because I have felt everything just as you have felt

I've seen how that shit always eats away at you
I will fight for you and be there for you
The next time you fall, I want to carry you
Let me be your soldier

I will fight for you and be there for you
The next time you fall, I want to carry you

Have you also hit your head against the wall?
So hard it felt like you blew it?
Have you also sworn never
Give up what you dreamed and looked forward to?
Have you also been at your job?
Then felt you were worth more than that?
Have you also stressed yourself out?
For a salary that barely satisfies your soul?
I have also lost sometimes
And quickly tried to catch up
I have also seen when you fall
And tried to build new from the ground up
I have also been close to my limit
So I understand exactly how it feels
But I promise that everything will turn around
If we promise to believe in ourselves

I've seen how that shit always eats away at you
I will fight for you and be there for you
The next time you fall, I want to carry you
Let me be your soldier
I've seen how that shit always eats away at you
I will fight for you and be there for you
The next time you fall, I want to carry you
Let me be your soldier
Because they point, look into us
Waving this way, must be reached
Creates norms, raises sorrows
Building castles in the air out of anxiety
Informs, propagates
Gives us scripts to live by
So we turn a blind eye to the crookedness
But if we dare, we can win

I've seen how that shit always eats away at you
I will fight for you and be there for you
The next time you fall, I want to carry you

Made friends and lost them through the years

And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Runnin' from the law through the backfields and gettin' drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

Lately, I've been, I've been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been prayin' hard
Said no more countin' dollars, we'll be countin' stars
Yeah, we'll be countin' stars

I see this life, like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
And in my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and ye' shall find

Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told

I feel something so right doin' the wrong thing
I feel something so wrong doin' the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

Flight from Stockholm via London then holiday in Paris
Late vacation in Paris

You are miles away but still you are naked

You can't catch me
There aren't many, no
Now they call me in the middle of the night
And tell me they regret it

I can take you to Paris (Yeah)
Fashion week here in London (Woo!)
We can fly tomorrow
Because there's money in the account (Woo!)

If I woke up without ya, I don't know what I would do
Thought I could be single forever till I met you
Usually don't be fallin', be fallin', fallin' fast
You got a way of keepin' me comin' back-to-back

Was to get back at your ex lover but before you leave
Usually I would never, would never even care
Baby, I know she creepin', I feel it in the air

Every night and every day (Every day)
I try to make you stay, but your

Om ett tag kommer du komma över mig
På en sommardag, träffar du någon annan
Han är lugn han är inte ett dugg som mig
Han säger alltid rätt sak, som alla andra

Men sen drar du ett skämt och får dra det igen
Och tänker det hade Alex fattat
Han gör allting rätt men när ni kollar på Friends
Så är det tyst där vi bruka skratta

Kanske blir vi vänner någon dag
Och jag kan vara glad att du är glad
För varför ska vi se på det med sorg
Bara för vi gick varsitt håll
Om vi blev starkare, starkare

Mina vänner sa alltid det löser sig
Du kommer falla snart
För någon annan

Men att det kanske var
Värt att chansa

In a while you will get over me
On a summer day, you meet someone else
He's calm, he's nothing like me
He always says the right thing, like everyone else

But then you make a joke and have to make it again
And thinking that, Alex would have understood
He does everything right but when you watch Friends
Then it's quiet where we used to laugh

Maybe we'll be friends one day
And I can be happy that you are happy
Because why should we look at it with sadness
Just because we went our separate ways
If we got stronger, stronger

My friends always said it would work out
You will fall soon
For someone else
She was cute, maybe just a little young for me
But that maybe it was
Worth the chance

But then I made a joke and had to make it again
And thought how can she not understand
She did everything right but when we watch Friends
Then she was silent where we usually laugh

Maybe we'll be friends one day
And I can be happy that you are happy
Because why should we look at it with sadness
Just because we went our separate ways
If we got stronger, stronger

We never cared what anyone thought
And I'm so ready to feel that with someone new
But why should we look at it with sadness
Just because we went somewhere
If it made me stronger
Stronger

Enter HERMIONE, MAMILLIUS, and Ladies
HERMIONE
Take the boy to you: he so troubles me,
'Tis past enduring.
FIRST LADY
Come, my gracious lord,
Shall I be your playfellow?
MAMILLIUS
No, I'll none of you.
FIRST LADY
Why, my sweet lord?
MAMILLIUS
You'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if
I were a baby still. I love you better.
SECOND LADY
And why so, my lord?
MAMILLIUS
Not for because
Your brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say,
Become some women best, so that there be not
Too much hair there, but in a semicircle
Or a half-moon made with a pen.
SECOND LADY
Who taught you this?
MAMILLIUS
I learnt it out of women's faces. Pray now
What colour are your eyebrows?
FIRST LADY
Blue, my lord.
MAMILLIUS
Nay, that's a mock: I have seen a lady's nose
That has been blue, but not her eyebrows.
FIRST LADY
Hark ye;
The queen your mother rounds apace: we shall
Present our services to a fine new prince
One of these days; and then you'ld wanton with us,
If we would have you.
SECOND LADY
She is spread of late
Into a goodly bulk: good time encounter her!
HERMIONE
What wisdom stirs amongst you? Come, sir, now
I am for you again: pray you, sit by us,
And tell 's a tale.
MAMILLIUS
Merry or sad shall't be?
HERMIONE
As merry as you will.
MAMILLIUS
A sad tale's best for winter: I have one
Of sprites and goblins.
HERMIONE
Let's have that, good sir.
Come on, sit down: come on, and do your best
To fright me with your sprites; you're powerful at it.
MAMILLIUS
There was a man--
HERMIONE
Nay, come, sit down; then on.
MAMILLIUS
Dwelt by a churchyard: I will tell it softly;
Yond crickets shall not hear it.
HERMIONE
Come on, then,
And give't me in mine ear.
Enter LEONTES, with ANTIGONUS, Lords and others
LEONTES
Was he met there? his train? Camillo with him?
First Lord
Behind the tuft of pines I met them; never
Saw I men scour so on their way: I eyed them
Even to their ships.
LEONTES
How blest am I
In my just censure, in my true opinion!
Alack, for lesser knowledge! how accursed
In being so blest! There may be in the cup
A spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,
And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge
Is not infected: but if one present
The abhorr'd ingredient to his eye, make known
How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,
With violent hefts. I have drunk,
and seen the spider.
Camillo was his help in this, his pander:
There is a plot against my life, my crown;
All's true that is mistrusted: that false villain
Whom I employ'd was pre-employ'd by him:
He has discover'd my design, and I
Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
For them to play at will. How came the posterns
So easily open?
FIRST LORD
By his great authority;
Which often hath no less prevail'd than so
On your command.
LEONTES
I know't too well.
Give me the boy: I am glad you did not nurse him:
Though he does bear some signs of me, yet you
Have too much blood in him.
HERMIONE
What is this? sport?
LEONTES
Bear the boy hence; he shall not come about her;
Away with him! and let her sport herself
With that she's big with; for 'tis Polixenes
Has made thee swell thus.
HERMIONE
But I'ld say he had not,
And I'll be sworn you would believe my saying,
Howe'er you lean to the nayward.
LEONTES
You, my lords,
Look on her, mark her well; be but about
To say 'she is a goodly lady,' and
The justice of your hearts will thereto add
'Tis pity she's not honest: Honourable
Praise her but for this her without-door form,
Which on my faith deserves high speech, and straight
The shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands
That calumny doth use--O, I am out--
That mercy does, for calumny will sear
Virtue itself: these shrugs, these hums and ha's,
When you have said 'she's goodly,' come between
Ere you can say 'she's honest:' but be 't known,
From him that has most cause to grieve it should be,
She's an adulteress.
HERMIONE
Should a villain say so,
The most replenish'd villain in the world,
He were as much more villain: you, my lord,
Do but mistake.
LEONTES
You have mistook, my lady,
Polixenes for Leontes: O thou thing!
Which I'll not call a creature of thy place,
Lest barbarism, making me the precedent,
Should a like language use to all degrees
And mannerly distinguishment leave out
Betwixt the prince and beggar: I have said
She's an adulteress; I have said with whom:
More, she's a traitor and Camillo is
A federary with her, and one that knows
What she should shame to know herself
But with her most vile principal, that she's
A bed-swerver, even as bad as those
That vulgars give bold'st titles, ay, and privy
To this their late escape.
HERMIONE
No, by my life.
Privy to none of this. How will this grieve you,
When you shall come to clearer knowledge, that
You thus have publish'd me! Gentle my lord,
You scarce can right me throughly then to say
You did mistake.
LEONTES
No; if I mistake
In those foundations which I build upon,
The centre is not big enough to bear
A school-boy's top. Away with her! to prison!
He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty
But that he speaks.
HERMIONE
There's some ill planet reigns:
I must be patient till the heavens look
With an aspect more favourable. Good my lords,
I am not prone to weeping, as our sex
Commonly are; the want of which vain dew
Perchance shall dry your pities: but I have
That honourable grief lodged here which burns
Worse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords,
With thoughts so qualified as your charities
Shall best instruct you, measure me; and so
The king's will be perform'd!
LEONTES
Shall I be heard?
HERMIONE
Who is't that goes with me? Beseech your highness,
My women may be with me; for you see
My plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools;
There is no cause: when you shall know your mistress
Has deserved prison, then abound in tears
As I come out: this action I now go on
Is for my better grace. Adieu, my lord:
I never wish'd to see you sorry; now
I trust I shall. My women, come; you have leave.
LEONTES
Go, do our bidding; hence!
Exit HERMIONE, guarded; with Ladies
FIRST LORD
Beseech your highness, call the queen again.
ANTIGONUS
Be certain what you do, sir, lest your justice
Prove violence; in the which three great ones suffer,
Yourself, your queen, your son.
FIRST LORD
For her, my lord,
I dare my life lay down and will do't, sir,
Please you to accept it, that the queen is spotless
I' the eyes of heaven and to you; I mean,
In this which you accuse her.
ANTIGONUS
If it prove
She's otherwise, I'll keep my stables where
I lodge my wife; I'll go in couples with her;
Than when I feel and see her no farther trust her;
For every inch of woman in the world,
Ay, every dram of woman's flesh is false, If she be.
LEONTES
Hold your peaces.
FIRST LORD
Good my lord,--
ANTIGONUS
It is for you we speak, not for ourselves:
You are abused and by some putter-on
That will be damn'd for't; would I knew the villain,
I would land-damn him. Be she honour-flaw'd,
I have three daughters; the eldest is eleven
The second and the third, nine, and some five;
If this prove true, they'll pay for't:
by mine honour,
I'll geld 'em all; fourteen they shall not see,
To bring false generations: they are co-heirs;
And I had rather glib myself than they
Should not produce fair issue.
LEONTES
Cease; no more.
You smell this business with a sense as cold
As is a dead man's nose: but I do see't and feel't
As you feel doing thus; and see withal
The instruments that feel.
ANTIGONUS
If it be so,
We need no grave to bury honesty:
There's not a grain of it the face to sweeten
Of the whole dungy earth.
LEONTES
What! lack I credit?
FIRST LORD
I had rather you did lack than I, my lord,
Upon this ground; and more it would content me
To have her honour true than your suspicion,
Be blamed for't how you might.
LEONTES
Why, what need we
Commune with you of this, but rather follow
Our forceful instigation? Our prerogative
Calls not your counsels, but our natural goodness
Imparts this; which if you, or stupefied
Or seeming so in skill, cannot or will not
Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
We need no more of your advice: the matter,
The loss, the gain, the ordering on't, is all
Properly ours.
ANTIGONUS
And I wish, my liege,
You had only in your silent judgment tried it,
Without more overture.
LEONTES
How could that be?
Either thou art most ignorant by age,
Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo's flight,
Added to their familiarity,
Which was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture,
That lack'd sight only, nought for approbation
But only seeing, all other circumstances
Made up to the deed, doth push on this proceeding:
Yet, for a greater confirmation,
For in an act of this importance 'twere
Most piteous to be wild, I have dispatch'd in post
To sacred Delphos, to Apollo's temple,
Cleomenes and Dion, whom you know
Of stuff'd sufficiency: now from the oracle
They will bring all; whose spiritual counsel had,
Shall stop or spur me. Have I done well?
FIRST LORD
Well done, my lord.
LEONTES
Though I am satisfied and need no more
Than what I know, yet shall the oracle
Give rest to the minds of others, such as he
Whose ignorant credulity will not
Come up to the truth. So have we thought it good
From our free person she should be confined,
Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence
Be left her to perform. Come, follow us;
We are to speak in public; for this business
Will raise us all.
ANTIGONUS
To laughter, as I take it,
If the good truth were known.
Exeunt1Embed","5 ContributorsThe Winter’s Tale Act 2 Scene 1 LyricsSCENE I. A room in LEONTES' palace.
Enter HERMIONE, MAMILLIUS, and Ladies
HERMIONE
Take the boy to you: he so troubles me,
'Tis past enduring.
FIRST LADY
Come, my gracious lord,
Shall I be your playfellow?
MAMILLIUS
No, I'll none of you.
FIRST LADY
Why, my sweet lord?
MAMILLIUS
You'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if
I were a baby still. I love you better.
SECOND LADY
And why so, my lord?
MAMILLIUS
Not for because
Your brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say,
Become some women best, so that there be not
Too much hair there, but in a semicircle
Or a half-moon made with a pen.
SECOND LADY
Who taught you this?
MAMILLIUS
I learnt it out of women's faces. Pray now
What colour are your eyebrows?
FIRST LADY
Blue, my lord.
MAMILLIUS
Nay, that's a mock: I have seen a lady's nose
That has been blue, but not her eyebrows.
FIRST LADY
Hark ye;
The queen your mother rounds apace: we shall
Present our services to a fine new prince
One of these days; and then you'ld wanton with us,
If we would have you.
SECOND LADY
She is spread of late
Into a goodly bulk: good time encounter her!
HERMIONE
What wisdom stirs amongst you? Come, sir, now
I am for you again: pray you, sit by us,
And tell 's a tale.
MAMILLIUS
Merry or sad shall't be?
HERMIONE
As merry as you will.
MAMILLIUS
A sad tale's best for winter: I have one
Of sprites and goblins.
HERMIONE
Let's have that, good sir.
Come on, sit down: come on, and do your best
To fright me with your sprites; you're powerful at it.
MAMILLIUS
There was a man--
HERMIONE
Nay, come, sit down; then on.
MAMILLIUS
Dwelt by a churchyard: I will tell it softly;
Yond crickets shall not hear it.
HERMIONE
Come on, then,
And give't me in mine ear.
Enter LEONTES, with ANTIGONUS, Lords and others
LEONTES
Was he met there? his train? Camillo with him?
First Lord
Behind the tuft of pines I met them; never
Saw I men scour so on their way: I eyed them
Even to their ships.
LEONTES
How blest am I
In my just censure, in my true opinion!
Alack, for lesser knowledge! how accursed
In being so blest! There may be in the cup
A spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,
And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge
Is not infected: but if one present
The abhorr'd ingredient to his eye, make known
How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,
With violent hefts. I have drunk,
and seen the spider.
Camillo was his help in this, his pander:
There is a plot against my life, my crown;
All's true that is mistrusted: that false villain
Whom I employ'd was pre-employ'd by him:
He has discover'd my design, and I
Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
For them to play at will. How came the posterns
So easily open?
FIRST LORD
By his great authority;
Which often hath no less prevail'd than so
On your command.
LEONTES
I know't too well.
Give me the boy: I am glad you did not nurse him:
Though he does bear some signs of me, yet you
Have too much blood in him.
HERMIONE
What is this? sport?
LEONTES
Bear the boy hence; he shall not come about her;
Away with him! and let her sport herself
With that she's big with; for 'tis Polixenes
Has made thee swell thus.
HERMIONE
But I'ld say he had not,
And I'll be sworn you would believe my saying,
Howe'er you lean to the nayward.
LEONTES
You, my lords,
Look on her, mark her well; be but about
To say 'she is a goodly lady,' and
The justice of your hearts will thereto add
'Tis pity she's not honest: Honourable
Praise her but for this her without-door form,
Which on my faith deserves high speech, and straight
The shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands
That calumny doth use--O, I am out--
That mercy does, for calumny will sear
Virtue itself: these shrugs, these hums and ha's,
When you have said 'she's goodly,' come between
Ere you can say 'she's honest:' but be 't known,
From him that has most cause to grieve it should be,
She's an adulteress.
HERMIONE
Should a villain say so,
The most replenish'd villain in the world,
He were as much more villain: you, my lord,
Do but mistake.
LEONTES
You have mistook, my lady,
Polixenes for Leontes: O thou thing!
Which I'll not call a creature of thy place,
Lest barbarism, making me the precedent,
Should a like language use to all degrees
And mannerly distinguishment leave out
Betwixt the prince and beggar: I have said
She's an adulteress; I have said with whom:
More, she's a traitor and Camillo is
A federary with her, and one that knows
What she should shame to know herself
But with her most vile principal, that she's
A bed-swerver, even as bad as those
That vulgars give bold'st titles, ay, and privy
To this their late escape.
HERMIONE
No, by my life.
Privy to none of this. How will this grieve you,
When you shall come to clearer knowledge, that
You thus have publish'd me! Gentle my lord,
You scarce can right me throughly then to say
You did mistake.
LEONTES
No; if I mistake
In those foundations which I build upon,
The centre is not big enough to bear
A school-boy's top. Away with her! to prison!
He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty
But that he speaks.
HERMIONE
There's some ill planet reigns:
I must be patient till the heavens look
With an aspect more favourable. Good my lords,
I am not prone to weeping, as our sex
Commonly are; the want of which vain dew
Perchance shall dry your pities: but I have
That honourable grief lodged here which burns
Worse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords,
With thoughts so qualified as your charities
Shall best instruct you, measure me; and so
The king's will be perform'd!
LEONTES
Shall I be heard?
HERMIONE
Who is't that goes with me? Beseech your highness,
My women may be with me; for you see
My plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools;
There is no cause: when you shall know your mistress
Has deserved prison, then abound in tears

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""

I met her on Grafton Street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you wanna drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room, swear she was singing to me

I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write

Kanske regnar det i april eller snöar det i Prag
Eller dansar vi ihop, yeah?
(Eller dansar vi ihop yeah? Ihop, yeah)
Kanske hittar vi varann, vissa saker hann ikapp
Vissa saker sprang ifrån, yeah
(Vissa saker sprang ifrån, sprang ifrån)

Jag slängde gang signs på skolfotot som ett stort pucko
Växte upp fort och blev kvar i samma port och
Tiden sprang ikapp dig som ett sommarlov mot slutet
Jag och Katta tog festen från Café Opera till akuten
(Ta en drink med mig)
Vem kan dricka mest?
Min Sony Ericsson var wing man, skicka SMS
Det sluta alltid med 'com' som en webbadress
Och alla va som Micke Bindefeld, de hade hemmafest
Men jag var hemma mest

Tårarna i halsen
(Lite darr i rösten)
Jag satt tårarna i halsen

I minusgrader, jag försöker ta mig framåt
Menar du att det är över?
Gör vad som helst för att få det som vi hade
Vem sa att killar inte gråter?
You might also like
Eyo, vi brukade glida omkring
Ba du och jag, minns hur jag va
Dum i huvet i huvudstan
Utekvällar, Trädgården, Slaktis, Stureplan
Jag va helt ute och cykla
(Tour de France!)
Sommaren i city, gitti som en hippie
Både kär i dig och mitt sticky icky icky
Jag va fett beng och du va fett cool med de
Inte som de andra flickorna jag gick i skolan med
Jag och mina boys, vi alla var konstiga
Bakom varann var vi kalla och nonchiga
De som var som oss var de vi kallade kompisar
Gjorde skit, aldrig att vi tjallade på varann
Hängde hela truppen, allihopa dela zutten
Innan vi drog jag hämta påsen och dela upp den
Ville ta ner mig på jorden men jag va mer i luften
Försökte spela tuff men du såg igenom bluffen

För man måste vara cool
Så jag satt tårarna i halsen, yeah
För man måste vara cool
Jag satt tårarna i halsen
I minusgrader, jag försöker ta mig framåt
Menar du att de är över?
Gör vad som helst för att få det som vi hade
Vem sa att killar inte gråter?

Svarar SMS för långsamt
Hög konstant, halvdöd i Zombieland
Och även fast du var en hjälpande hand
Så var det klart att jag inte ens var hälften en man
Så förlåt, för att jag var en mothafucking douchebag
Var inte meningen av mig att vara ovärd
Har inte hittat hem än, men är på god väg
Och när jag gör det hoppas jag att du stod där
Jag mena står där och då vet jag vad cool är

Och sätter inte tårarna i halsen
No! För jag lovar, jag lovar
Jag satt tårarna i halsen

I minusgrader, jag försöker ta mig framåt
Menar du att de är över?
Gör vad som helst för att få det som vi hade

Maybe it rains in April or it snows in Prague
Or we dance together, yeah?
(Or do we dance together yeah? Together, yeah)
Maybe we'll find each other, some things caught up
Some things ran away, yeah
(Some things ran away, ran away)

I threw gang signs on the school photo like a big puck
Grew up fast and stayed in the same gate and
Time caught up with you like a summer vacation towards the end
Katta and I took the party from Café Opera to the emergency room
(Have a drink with me)
Who can drink the most?
My Sony Ericsson was wing man, send SMS
It always ends with 'com' as a web address
And everyone was like Micke Bindefeld, they had a house party
But I was at home most of the time

Tears in the throat
(Slight tremor in voice)
I had tears in my throat

In freezing temperatures, I try to move forward
Do you mean it's over?
Do whatever it takes to get what we had
Who Said Guys Don't Cry?
You might also like
Eyo, we used to slide around
You and I, remember how I was
Stupid in the hood in the capital
Evenings out, the Garden, Slaktis, Stureplan
I was completely out cycling
(Tour de France!)
Summer in the city, went like a hippie
Both in love with you and my sticky icky icky
I'm cool and you're cool with them
Not like the other girls I went to school with
Me and my boys, we were all weird
Behind each other we were cold and indifferent
Those who were like us were the ones we called friends
Did shit, never that we yelled at each other
Hanged the whole squad, all share the zutten
Before we left, I got the bag and divided it
Wanted to bring me down to earth but I was more in the air
Tried to play tough but you saw through the scam

Because you have to be cool
So I had tears in my throat, yeah
Because you have to be cool
I had tears in my throat
In freezing temperatures, I try to move forward
Do you mean they are over?
Do whatever it takes to get what we had
Who Said Guys Don't Cry?

Responds to SMS too slowly
High constant, half dead in Zombieland
And even if you were a helping hand
Then it was clear that I wasn't even half a man
So sorry, for being a mothafucking douchebag
I didn't mean to be unworthy
Haven't found home yet, but well on the way
And when I do, I hope you were standing there
I mean it's there and then I know what's cool

And don't choke the tears
Well! Because I promise, I promise
I had tears in my throat

In freezing temperatures, I try to move forward
Do you mean they are over?
Do whatever it takes to get what we had
Who said guys don't cry? 9Embed",sv,"{'wasnt', 'france', 'throat', 'tour', 'city', 'sticky', 'gate', 'whatever', 'guy', 'behind', 'tried', 'home', 'cycling', 'sorry', 'slide', 'unworthy', 'micke', 'cool', 'snow', 'ran', 'summer', 'room', 'douchebag', 'dance', 'capital', 'drink', 'rain', 'try', 'icky', 'around', 'shit', 'evening', 'way', 'slowly', 'puck', 'party', 'big', 'sony', 'address', 'photo', 'opera', 'hippie', 'scam', 'tear', 'whole', 'grew', 'took', 'lyric', 'used', 'end', 'together', 'voice', 'temperature', 'fast', 'indifferent', 'ericsson', 'left', 'promise', 'dead', 'slight', 'completely', 'choke', 'stureplan', 'half', 'hood', 'caught', 'friend', 'away', 'play', 'forward', 'gang', 'wing', 'bring', 'web', 'girl', 'prague', 'well', 'earth', 'mean', 'hope', 'standing', 'maybe', 'remember', 'saw', 'time', 'clear', 'yelled', 'zombieland', 'school', 'zutten', 'high', 'helping', 'squad', 'threw', 'katta', 'man', 'bindefeld', 'love', 'constant', 'cry', 'move', 'find', 'mothafucking', 'air', 'tough', 'freezing', 'emergency', 'everyone', 'found', 'house', 'contributorstears', 'tremor', 'thing', 'weird', 'called', 'responds', 'hanged', 'stupid', 'bag', 'slaktis', 'divided', 'sign', 'cold', 'hand', 'send', 'stayed', 'eyo', 'share', 'towards', 'vacation', 'café', 'com', 'went', 'april', 'garden', 'boy'}"

Vill du bli klippt? Jag är barber (Ching, ching, ching)

It's Christmas time
There's no need to be afraid
At Christmas time
We let in light and we banish shade

And in our world of plenty
We can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world
At Christmas time

But say a prayer
Pray for the other ones
At Christmas time it's hard
But when you're having fun

There's a world outside your window
And it's a world of dread and fear

Where the only water flowing
Is the bitter sting of tears
You might also like
And the Christmas bells that ring there
Are the clanging chimes of doom

Well tonight thank God it's them
Instead of you

And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmas time
The greatest gift they'll get this year is life (Oooh)
Where nothing ever grows, no rain or rivers flow
Do they know it's Christmas time at all?

Here's to you

Raise a glass for everyone

Here's to them

Underneath that burning sun
Do they know it's Christmas time at all?

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
""Let It Snow"" is blasting out
But I won't get in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's

True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day, I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold

Always chased money before hoes
Would sit twenty for my bro

Are there torches all the way like last year
Knows the air carries incense and oaths
Because no one makes ribs like a mother
And on the fireplace we all have our own sock
It's Christmas again and I can never get enough
And Maria, what you did makes me feel good
Thank God you didn't have an abortion
There is a river, a hundred gift cards and a fly rod
Hands full, aquavit and carols

Jag har skrivit ditt namn på en spegel med läppstift
Och jag vet det låter klyschigt
Och du har ritat ett hjärta på spegel med läppstift
Men nu faller vi helt fritt, Uh
För du sa att mitt stjärntecken var ett problem för vi båda var dragna till drama
Men jag tror inte astrologi är den saken som fick oss och dala
För du frågade om jag dör för dig
Men baby jag vill leva nu
Och det är 02:00
Och du ringer non-stop
Och vi gör det som förut

Och du kan catcha mig i sängen gör ba' grejer som hon älskar nu
You took my breath away, vill ändå aldrig andas ut

Du var min Mandy Moore, Mandy Moore
Och jag går tillbaks för ofta fast vår kärlek är på låtsas
Du min Mandy Moore
Du min Mandy Moore
Alla tårar har jag torkat när mitt hjärta blivit krossat

Jag ser bara gyllende portar
På huvudet sitter en gloria
I mina ögon så finns en historia
Den sista förloraren har nog den fulaste kronan
Så snurra min flaska igen
Sanning på sanning, det blir konsekvens
Älskar det stökiga i våran cell
Den brukar va' grå men den lyser ikväll
Och rött är så vackert
Så blodet ja' blöder det droppar i timmar ibland
Och rött är så vackert
Jag gör vad som helst

Du min Mandy Moore
Alla tårar har jag torkat när mitt hjärta blivit krossat

If we're talking 'bout someone who's never been upfront, we should be talking about you
Well I'm gonna be upfront now, I'm not over you

En akilles häl och en ängel
En explosion och min låga
Min första kyss i regnet
Och den enda som fått mig att komma
Mitt bästa sex och mitt enda ex och mitt andetag och vårt nederlag
Kritiker står där på bion idag
Recensionen är bra
Jag får gåshud när jag ser dig nu
Och hur mår du när allt är diffust?
Catcha mig för sista gången så att vi kan andas ut
Du var min Mandy Moore, Mandy Moore
Och jag går tillbaks för ofta fast vår kärlek är på låtsas
Du min Mandy Moore

I have written your name on a mirror with lipstick
And I know it sounds cliche
And you have drawn a heart on the mirror with lipstick
But now we fall completely free, Uh
Because you said my star sign was a problem because we were both drawn to drama
But I don't think astrology is the thing that got us down
Because you asked if I would die for you
But baby I want to live now
And it's 2:00 AM
And you call non-stop
And we do it as before

And you can catch me in bed doing ba' stuff that she loves now
You took my breath away, still never want to breathe out

You were my Mandy Moore, Mandy Moore
And I go back too often even though our love is pretend
You my Mandy Moore
You my Mandy Moore
I have dried all the tears when my heart was broken

I only see golden gates
On the head sits a halo
In my eyes, there is a story
The last loser probably has the ugliest crown
So spin my bottle again
Truth on truth, there will be consequence
Love the messy in our cell
It's usually gray but it lights up tonight
And red is so beautiful
So the blood does bleed, it drips for hours sometimes
And red is so beautiful

Jag har aldrig varit den som gråter
Jag skrattar bort det som gör ont
Men när du går så kommer känslor åter
Din silhuett i horisont

Jag skulle ge allt för att vara hos dig
Mina tårar bara brinner i mig

Men kommer du ihåg den första gången
Du dansa in i min famn?
Och det var eld och lågor, inga sorger
Bara två hjärtan som brann
De kan bygga murar framför mig
Jag skulle riva dem bara för dig

Jag har aldrig varit en vän av mörker
Som många gånger gått isär
Men kanske är det bara jag som söker
En börda ingen annan bär

I've never been one to cry
I laugh away what hurts
But when you leave, feelings come back
Your silhouette on the horizon

I would give anything to be with you
My tears just burn inside me

But do you remember the first time
You dance into my arms?
And there was fire and flames, no sorrows
Just two hearts that burned
They can build walls in front of me
I would tear them just for you

I have never been a friend of darkness
Which many times fell apart
But maybe it's just me looking
A burden no one else carries

I would give anything to be with you

Ooh, ooh, ooh

She knows exactly how to tantalize
She's out to get you, danger by design
Cold-blooded vixen, she don't compromise

She's somethin' mystical in colored lights
So far from typical, but take my advice
Before you play with fire, do think twice
And if you get burned, don't be surprised

Jag har sprungit flera mil, ja säkert tusen

Tagit tåget till Berlin och jag har festat hela natten
Sköljt ner lyckopillerna med heligt vatten
Men ingenting har ännu fått mig att bli hel

Djupt i flaskan
Nerför röda mattan
Trodde lyckan fanns i kändisarnas slattar
Men hur mycket jag än drack, så blev det stelt
Gick till kyrkan
Fråga prästen, bad till gud och plöjde Bibeln
Gjorde hundra lyckotester i mobilen

I have run several miles, yes probably a thousand
But I haven't been able to find it yet
Took the train to Berlin and I've been partying all night
Wash down the lucky pills with holy water
But nothing has yet made me whole
It seems so easy for those who have found home
Who found the solution
But I just can't find it
The instruction book
For those who are lost in life
The one for those who are looking for something all the time
I've looked everywhere
But I can't find it
The instruction book
I have been searching
Deep in the bottle
Down the red carpet
Thought happiness was in the slats of celebrities
But no matter how much I drank, I became stiff

Stjärnorna
Faller i natten nu
Himlarna sänker sig
Ner över Jorden
Och när stjärnans bloss
Tänder sitt ljus hos oss
Brinner en låga klar
I hela Norden

Julen är här
Och lyser frid på jorden
Glädjen är stor
I ett barns klara ögon bor den
Julen är här
I våra mörka länder
Kom låt oss ta varandras händer
När julen är här

Och jag vill
Tända en stjärna till
Den som har frusit och
Gått fel i världen
För den som inte finns hos oss
Tänder vi nu ett bloss
Brinner en låga klar
Kom hit, här är de

The stars
Falling into the night now
The heavens are lowering
Down above the Earth
And when the star flares
Lights his candle with us
Burning a flame clear
Throughout the Nordic region

Christmas is here
And shines peace on earth
The joy is great
It lives in the clear eyes of a child
Christmas is here
In our dark lands
Come let's hold each other's hands
When Christmas is here

And I want to
Light another star
The one who has frozen and
Gone wrong with the world
For those who are not with us
Let's light a flare now
Burning a flame clear
Come here, here they are

I am a calm person with tact and tone
Moderate and balanced
I am quiet and still and it takes a lot
Before I get excited
But I have a vice that keeps me stuck
In an iron grip every winter

And the sledges' sledges slink

A show is forgotten if it just shows up
Effects that you hardly expect
So give me thirty degrees cold, elves everywhere
And a forest of green firs
I want snow-laden houses, thousands of lights

I can see a better time when all our dreams come true

They've got cars big as bars, they've got rivers of gold
But the wind goes right through you, it's no place for the old
When you first took my hand on a cold Christmas Eve
You promised me Broadway was waiting for me

You were handsome, you were pretty, queen of New York City
When the band finished playing, they howled out for more
Sinatra was swinging, all the drunks, they were singing
We kissed on a corner, then danced through the night

The boys of the NYPD choir
Were singing, ""Galway Bay""

It was Christmas Eve, babe, in the drunk tank
An old man said to me, ""Won't see another one""
And then he sang a song, 'The Rare Old Mountain Dew'
I turned my face away and dreamed about you

Got on a lucky one, came in eighteen-to-one
I've got a feeling this year's for me and you
So, Happy Christmas, I love you, baby

Han hade sagt att jag var lös till sina polare
Ändå var det han som skrev på snap och bara frågade
Om jag ville komma hem till han en kväll
Men nej tack sover hellre själv
För du är inte alls mitt klientel

Han ville dricka bubbel på balkongen
Röka cigg och hålla om mig
Men jag ville bara ut å ströga
Åka femton var på Löga
Bubbel på balkongen
Röka cigg och hålla om mig
Men jag ville bara ut å ströga
Åka femton var på Löga

Hon sa till sina polare att jag var känd, en, levande legend
Hon skrev till mig på snap och fråga, får jag komma hem?
Till dig och dricka bubbel, äta 
Jag kan dansa runt en stång om du kan göra helikopter
Jag bara wow, okej, jävla vilken brud
Hon skulle komma hem till mig redan klockan sju
Och skicka några bilder från å sitta mig på kroken
När jag nappade direkt och ställde in och gå på kroken
Jag var den som stanna, gjorde det fint
Hon var den som inte ens kom hit
Nå ser jag dig på story i en bil med någon drick
En riktig jävla raggare med skägg

He had said I was loose to his pals
Still, he was the one who wrote on snap and just asked
If I wanted to come to his house one evening
But no thanks, I'd rather sleep by myself
Because you are not my clientele at all

He wanted to drink bubbles on the balcony
Smoking cigs and holding me
But I just wanted to go out for a walk
Aka fifteen was on Löga
Bubbles on the balcony
Smoking cigs and holding me
But I just wanted to go out for a walk
Aka fifteen was on Löga

She told her pals I was famous, a, living legend
She texted me on snap and asked, can I come home?
To you and drink bubbles, eat
I can dance around a pole if you can do a helicopter
I just wow, okay, damn what a chick
She was supposed to come to my house already at seven o'clock
And send me some pictures from sitting on the hook
When I immediately snapped and set and go on the hook
I was the one to stay, did fine
She was the one who didn't even come here
Now I see you on story in a car with someone to drink
A real fucking rag with a beard

It was great at the very start
Hands on each other
Couldn't stand to be far apart
Closer the better

Now we're picking fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more

Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight

Förstår att det tagit tid nu
Borde kommit över dig

Och allt vi haft förut
Har varit så in och ut
Men vet att jag håller ut, baby
För jag har sett det förr
Vi kan sväva på moln
Sväva på moln

Jag kommer aldrig ge upp tills jag har dig
Jag stannar kvar
Om allting skiter sig så vet du att jag har dig
De andra borde se upp
Ingen av dom gör dig som jag
Ingen annan får mig må som när du klär av dig

Should have gotten over you
But everything falls on me
Too hard to pass up now
Missing the way you touch me
To wake up, be next to you

And everything we had before
Been so in and out
But know I'm holding on, baby
Because I've seen it before
We can float on clouds
Soar on clouds

I will never give up until I have you
I'm staying
If everything sucks, you know I've got you
The others should watch out
None of them make you like me
No one else makes me feel the way you do when you undress

I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think

My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's comin' from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter

Vi har känt varann i 100 år
Men jag minns som att vi möttes igår
Suttit ihop sen den första gången vi sågs
Rektors expeditionen, vi var i trubbel båda två
Oooh
Snatta godis och spanade runt på toppless boobies
Sommaren lång
Smygrökte och kastade blöta papper och
Vattenballonger från din balkong
Oooh ooh oooh
De säger vi är inte bra för varann
Yei ye ye ye
Men brorsan, ingen klipper vårat band

Vi går från askan och rätt in i elden
Vi två kommer alltid va så
Om allting skiter sig, du skulle dö för mig
Som jag dör för dig
Vi går från askan och rätt in i elden
Vi två kommer alltid bestå
För at the end of the day, du skulle dö för mig
Som jag dör för dig
För dig, för dig, för dig, för dig
För dig, för dig, för dig
Jag skulle dö för dig
För at the end of the day, du skulle dö för mig

Skar oss handen när vi lova varann
Att aldrig svika, rulla sida vid sida

We have known each other for 100 years
But I remember as if we met yesterday
Been together since the first time we met
The headmaster's expedition, we were both in trouble
Oooh
Grabbing candy and snooping around on topless boobies
Summer long
Sneaky smoked and threw wet papers and
Water balloons from your balcony
Oooh ooh oooh
They say we are not good for each other
Yee yee yee
But brother, no one is cutting our ties

We walk from the ashes and right into the fire
The two of us will always be like that
If everything sucks, you'd die for me
As I die for you
We walk from the ashes and right into the fire
The two of us will always last
Because at the end of the day, you would die for me
As I die for you
For you, for you, for you, for you
For you, for you, for you

And the triangle drama was on
Even though I know she digs you a little more

To never fail, roll side by side
Can never forget have a scar in my hand

So I'll use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude

I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh, all my friends are turning green
You're the magician's assistant in their dream

Oh, oh-o-oh, and they come unstuck

Taken away to the dark side

I love you, when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat 'cause

Saw you walk inside a bar
He said somethin' to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do

Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're movin' on with someone new

'Cause, baby, you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then, I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down
Let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down

Yeah, I guess I'm a disappointment, doin' everything I can
I don't wanna make you disappointed, it's annoying
I just wanna make you feel like everything I ever do
Was never tryna make an issue for you, but I guess the more you
Thought about everything you were never even wrong
In the first place, right? Yeah, I'ma just ignore you
Walking towards you with my head down
Lookin' at the ground, I'm embarrassed for you
Paranoia, what did I do wrong this time?
That's parents for you
Very loyal? Shoulda had my back
But you put a knife in it—my hands are full
What else should I carry for you?
I cared for you, but…

You don't wanna know my hurt, yeah

How can we keep going at a rate like this?
We can't, so I guess I'ma have to leave
Please, don't come after me
I just wanna be alone right now, I don't really wanna think at all
Go ahead, just drink it off
Both know you're gonna call tomorrow like nothing's wrong
Ain't that what you always do?

What else can I offer you?

Packed all my clothes and I moved out
I don't even wanna go to your house
Every time I sit on that couch
I feel like you lecture me, eventually, I bet that we
Coulda made this work
And prolly woulda figured things out
But I guess I'm a letdown
But it's cool, I checked out
Oh, you wanna be friends now?
Okay, let's put my fake face on and pretend now
Sit around and talk about the good times that didn't even happen
I mean, why are you laughing?
Must have missed that joke, let me see if I can find a reaction
No, but at least you're happy

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Whoo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee!
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic 'cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause I'm—
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath

Could be over tomorrow, so I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losin' your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo! I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
'Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'

Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the—

Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'

Who are goin' through a struggle, feels it and relates, that's great

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Whoo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee!
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic 'cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause I'm—
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed

Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk to the way you move

'Cause you feel like home, you're like a dream come true
But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know

Thought I could leave you 'cause I felt my heart numbing
It hits so deep, I closed my eyes and I just took off running
I turned around and saw the look on your face
So I stayed, stayed

But I don't need you and you should know that, baby
It'd take a miracle for you to really try and change me
And I felt sorry for the look on your face
So I stayed, stayed
So I stayed, stayed
So I stayed, stayed

You wanna leave her, don't wanna hurt nobody
I don't believe a single word you say or that you're sorry
Why can't I say no to the look on your face?
I just stay, stay
So I stayed, stayed
So I stayed, stayed

You push me away, push me away
But I always stay, I always stay, yeah
You push me away, push me away
But I always stay, I always stay
But I always stay, I always stay, yeah
You push me away, push me away
But I always stay, I always stay, yeah
You push me away, push me away
But I always stay, I always stay
But will you, will you, will you?

So I stayed, stayed
So I stayed, stayed

Oh, why do I stay?

I, I've been keeping secrets from you, dear
There's things in me I'm scared that you might fear
It crackles in the ground
And you, you've been coming closer to the edge
Wondering what goes on in my head
And so I shut you out

And I guess that we don't mean to be falling apart
But you will always have a special place in my heart
I never wanted this to end
Can you forgive me, friend?

'Cause I fell in the hole, in the hole, in the hole
My heart was turning cold, turning cold, turning cold
I never wanted this to end
Can you forgive me, friend?

And I, I promised you that we would never change
That you and me would always stay the same
How I let you down

And I guess that we don't mean to be falling apart
But you will always have a special place in my heart
I never wanted this to end
Can you forgive me, friend?

I can swear, I can joke
I say what's on my mind
If I drink, if I smoke
I keep up with the guys
And you see me holding up my middle finger to the world
Fuck your ribbons and your pearls
'Cause I'm not just a pretty girl

I'm more than just a picture
I'm a daughter and a sister
Sometimes it's hard for me to show
That I'm more than just a rumor
Or a song on your computer
There's more to me than people know

Some days I'm broke, some days I'm rich
Some days I'm nice, some days I can be a bitch
Some days I'm strong, some days I quit
I don't let it show, but I've been through some shit

I can swear, I can joke
I say what's on my mind
If I drink, if I smoke
I keep up with the guys
And you see me holding up my middle finger to the world
Fuck your ribbons and your pearls
'Cause I'm not just a pretty girl

Some days I'm broke, some days I'm rich
