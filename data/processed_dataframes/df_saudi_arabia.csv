I wanna take you somewhere so you know I care
But it's so cold and I don't know where
I brought you daffodils in a pretty string
But they won't flower like they did last spring
And I wanna kiss you, make you feel alright
I'm just so tired to share my nights
I wanna cry and I wanna love
But all my tears have been used up

On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
Up

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

And if somebody hurts you, I wanna fight
But my hand's been broken one too many times
So I'll use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude
Words, they always win, but I know I'll lose
And I'd sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna learn to love
But all my tears have been used up
You might also like
On another love, another love

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Oh, need a love, now, my heart is thinking of)

I wanna sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna fall in love
But all my tears have been used up

On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love

Thought I found a way
Thought I found a way out (Found)
But you never go away (Never go away)
So I guess I gotta stay now

Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear

Isn't it lovely, all alone?
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home

Walking out of time
Looking for a better place (Looking for a better place)
Something's on my mind
Always in my head space

But I know someday I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near

Yeah

I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm goin' through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby

I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust

I'm like, ""Yeah, that's true"" (That's true)

Don't believe in T-H-O-T
She keep playing me dumb (Play me)
I'ma play her for fun (Uh-huh)
Y'all don't really know my mental
Let me give you the picture like stencil
Fallin' out in a drought
No flow, rain wasn't pourin' down (Pourin' down)
See, that pain was all around
See, my mode was kinda lounged
Didn't know which, which way to turn
Flow was cool but I still felt burnt
Energy up, you can feel my surge
I'ma kill everything like this purge (Ayy)
You might also like
Let's just get this straight for a second, I'ma work (Yuh)
Even if I don't get paid for progression, I'ma get it (Uh, get it)
Everything that I do is electric (Ayy)
I'ma keep it in a motion, keep it movin' like kinetic, ayy (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Put this shit in a frame, better know I don't blame
Everything that I say, man, I seen you deflate
Let me elevate, this ain't a prank
Have you walkin' on a plank, li-li-li-li-like
Both hands together, God, let me pray (Now let me pray), uh
I've been goin' right, right around, call that relay (Masked Wolf)
Pass the baton, back and I'm on
Swimmin' in the pool, Kendrick Lamar, uh (Ayy)
Want a piece of this, a piece of mine, my peace a sign
Can you please read between the lines?
My rhyme's inclined to break your spine (Spine)
They say that I'm so fine (Fine)
You could never match my grind (True)
Please do not, not waste my time (Wolf)

8,8,8,The Neighbourhood,Sweater Weather,"180 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçePortuguêsDanskРусскийPortuguêsFrançaisSweater Weather Lyrics
And all I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach but I stand
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high waisted shorts, oh

She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no

'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love the taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside, it starts to pour
You might also like
Comin' down
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about
No, no, no

'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater, woah

Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah

'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

Come on, Harry, we wanna say goodnight to you

Holdin' me back
Gravity's holdin' me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don't we leave it at that?
Nothin' to say
When everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced
And I'm the one who will stay, oh-oh-oh

You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same

Answer the phone
""Harry, you're no good alone
Why are you sitting at home on the floor?
What kind of pills are you on?""
Ringin' the bell
And nobody's coming to help

Get your soldiers, tell 'em that the break is over

Uh, need to, uh
Need to get this album done
Need a couple number onеs

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

Usually, I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today, I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road

You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I say goodbye

Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad

From the kitchen to the bathroom sink and
Your steps keep me awake

Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly

Cruise the city in a bulletproof Cadillac (Skrrt)

Nigga try to get me for my water
I'll lay his ass down, on my son, on my daughter

Lotta niggas out here playin', ain't ballin'
I done put my whole arm in the rim, Vince Carter (Yeah)
And I know probably get a key for the quarter
Shawty barely seen in double C's, I bought 'em

20,20,20,Adele,Set Fire to the Rain,"86 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolBahasa MelayuSet Fire to the Rain Lyrics

I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
Your name
You might also like
When I lay with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together, nothing is better

'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
Your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When we fell, somethin' died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time
Sometimes, I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waitin' for you
Even now, when we're already over
I can't help myself from lookin' for you

I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
Your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When we fell, somethin' died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time

We hug and, yes, we make love
And always just say goodnight (La-la-la-la-la-la)
And we cuddle, sure, I do love it
But I need your lips on mine

Can you kiss me more?
We're so young, boy, we ain't got nothin' to lose, oh-oh
It's just principle
Baby, hold me 'cause I like the way you groove, oh-oh

Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Oh, I love the taste, la-la-la-la-la-la
All on my tongue, I want it (La-la-la-la-la-la)
Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Oh, I love the taste, la-la-la-la-la-la
All on my tongue, I want it (La-la-la-la-la-la)

I, I feel like fuckin' somethin'
But we could be corny, fuck it
Sugar, I ain't no dummy, dummy
I likе to say, ""What if?"" But if
We could kiss and just cut the rubbish
Then I might bе onto somethin'
I ain't givin' you one in public
I'm givin' you hundreds, fuck it
Somethin' we just gotta get into
Sign first, middle, last on the wisdom tooth
Niggas wishin' that the pussy was a kissin' booth
Taste breakfast, lunch, and gin and juice
And that dinner just like dessert too
And when we French, refresh, give me two
When I bite that lip, come get me too
He want lipstick, lip gloss, hickeys too, huh

Found you when your heart was broke
I filled your cup until it overflowed
Took it so far to keep you close (Keep you close)
I was afraid to leave you on your own (Ooh)

I said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinkin' you could live without me
Thinkin' you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

We could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared

Put your loving hands out, baby
'Cause I'm beggin'

I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hands out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hands out, darlin'

Riding high when I was king
I played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything
I walked away, you won me then
But easy come and easy go and it would end

So anytime I bleed, you let me go
Yah, anytime I feed, you get me know
Anytime I seek, you let me know
But I planted that seed, just let me grow
I'm on my knees when I'm beggin'
'Cause I don't wanna lose you
Hey, yeah, ra-ta-ta-ta!

'Cause I'm beggin', beggin' you
Uh, put your loving hands out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you, ah
And put your loving hands out, darlin'

I need you to understand
Tried so hard to be your man
The kind of man you want in the end
Only then can I begin to live again

An empty shell, I used to be
The shadow of my life was hangin' over me
A broken man that I don't know
Won't even stand the devil's dance to win my soul

What we doin'? What we chasin'?
Why the bottom? Why the basement?
Why we got good shit, don't embrace it?
Why the feel for the need to replace me?
You're the wrong way track from the good
I want to paint a picture tellin' where we could be at
Like a heart in the best way should
You can give it away, you had it and you took the pay
But I keep walkin' on, keep openin' doors
Keep hopin' for, now the door is yours
Keep also home
'Cause I don't want to live in a broken home, girl, I'm beggin'
Mmm, yeah-yeah, yeah, I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hands out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hands out, darlin'

I'm fighting hard to hold my own
Just can't make it all alone
I'm holding on, I can't fall back
I'm just a calm, 'bout to fade to black

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (Fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""

I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see

If they knew what they said would go straight to my head

Legends never die
When the world is callin' you
Can you hear them screaming out your name?
Legends never die
They become a part of you
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness
Relentless you survive

They never lose hope
When everything's cold and the fighting's near
It's deep in their bones
They'll run into smoke when the fire is fierce

Oh, pick yourself up 'cause

Thursday, July 16, 2020
Running against the clock, but the clock hated me on 10 pm 20
Intricate day, let me say I was a little busy
Apply my family orders like a pizza man delivery
Jogging l3am kaml even I’m fat, like a machine gun
But 365 never shares or d-d-divided with me
History save!, before I get taped
I don’t wanna drop the key, I wanna be at the end a fairy tail
It’s time to spit what I’m felling on the paper
Shocking content get some sugar or bring some pepper
It took me days to write this with my flavor
I ain't got no wheels, I’m a true pro player like a faker
While I remember the girl that dated she was bhal Tayka
Evil with the makeup, then we break up
Zero percent chances like a naked, the truth rises the silence
The silence kills, Start the funeral, Bury me, invite the undertaker
I’m telling you Whenever, wherever whichever
Whoever I’m already dead inside, however
I just wanna recall the day that I stepped outside
Waddling like duck perhaps at the mid of night
Catching up a taxi Hello sir where you want to go
Please put me in avenue look at me
I called that, I struggle with that cuz I'm lonely
How this verse could be good enough if got somebody

Thinking on a clue for my puzzle to make proof
Life moves leisurely in such a sort of crossword clues
I don’t know why, why this make changes on me
Such randomly, occasionally through my moods
I guess that I’m not the only one with the same groove
Stir the water, the thirsty might show up with the same view
Take or leave it until another day
In any way, you’ll get that we’re all in the same crew
Maybe we’ll make Rendez-Vous in the heaven
For the remission of our sins just say Lahi3fu Or probably Hallelu

I see you, you see me
How pleasant, this feeling
The moment you hold me
I missed you, I'm sorry
I've given what I have
I showed you I'm growing
The ashes fall slowly
As your voice consoles me

As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss

You've been hiding them in hollowed out pianos left in the dark

Look out for yourself

For my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground
I'm searchin' to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world that was smilin' when I turned

Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us

Oh, the misery

Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y

Your words up on thе wall as you're prayin' for my fall
And the laughter in thе halls and the names that I've been called
I stack it in my mind, and I'm waitin' for the time
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic

Ready to go whenever, just let me know
The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable
I'ma tell 'em, ""Hasta luego""
They wanna plot on my trot to the top
I been outta shape, thinkin' out the box, I'm an astronaut
I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe
And it matters more because I had it not
Had I thought about wreaking havoc
On an opposition, kinda shockin' they wanted static
With precision, I'm automatic quarterback
I ain't talkin' sackin', pack it
Pack it up, I don't panic, batter-batter up
Who the baddest? It don't matter 'cause we at your throat
Everybody wants to be my enemy

We play games of love to avoid the depression
We been here before and I won't be a victim

هاك يدي فيدك نبداو التصليح

حيت راك مسلم العالم منك مرعوب
حيت راك مسلم روشيرشي مطلوب
أي عمل إجرامي للمسلم منسوب
أي تاريخ دامي على المسلم محسوب
قلهم بلي حنايا عايقين بالملعوب

ولي كتبو مخطط لكل هذ لحروب

Brother Muslim, listen well
These people want your value to be low
They want to convince the world that they are ugly
Yes, you love blood, but you love other than slaughtered
Yes, your religion is violence, yes, your book is defamation
Yes, your heart is a solution, but you want armament
Tell us what our religion needs to be clarified
The religion of Islam, peace and praise
You and I know what is right
It can be dirty and despicable to Christ
Here is my hand, so we can start repairing
This is not satisfactory and our book vaccination
Keep your head up and your heart wounded
Your way is long and upwind
Take your religion and learn and your tongue eloquent
His face all the world sang and shouted
 (X4)
I am Muslim
Tell the world I am a Muslim
And your head is high

Tell them that I am a Muslim and not a terrorist, tell them that I am a Muslim and not a suicide bomber
Tell them I'm a liar
Religion Dialak Bari Lee Fahmo upside down
When a Muslim sees you, the world is terrified of you
Hait Rak Muslim Rocherchi wanted
Any criminal act attributed to a Muslim
Any bloody history on the Muslim calculated
Tell them yes Hanaya Aaikin Balmloub
Yes, this is a movie and a written script
And those who wrote a plan for all these wars
He wanted to reach the goal in the most despicable manner
Industry enemy and hitter hitter
And the Muslim is a terrorist, right and stylist
Or they see us and shake our hearts
Nkob suicide bomber combat terrorist
Whereas I am a Muslim

Beware of the Muslim destabilizes the faith
Don't you get a trap
There is always a war, and this is a new plan
Can be sewn old and returned Bdaou Valtnvida
Bash Akhlwa your picture is necessary plot
They want to provoke you to deliver the supply
They heard the holy bash heat up the cold
He told you this is a movie. This is a drawing in a newspaper
Muslim bull and wake up from Tarqidah
We want to stay in history as a restriction
The world and the Muslim have a bitter enmity
Between a Muslim and a non-Muslim
Shiites, Sunnis, Takfir and Al Qaeda
Tlhina with each other and Bala Fnaida
Our nation is Marisha and its cure is in monotheism
And I want Nvida
Whereas I am a Muslim
 (X4)
Always keep your head up as a Muslim while you are, the world knows the best of people, tell them I am a Muslim

Tell the world I am a Muslim
And your head is high

Astro, yeah

Sun is down, freezin' cold
That's how we already know, winter's here
My dawg would probably do it for a Louis belt
That's just all he know, he don't know nothin' else
I tried to show 'em, yeah
I tried to show 'em, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Goin' on you with the pick and roll
Young La Flame, he in sicko mode

(Woo) Made this here with all the ice on in the booth
At the gate outside, when they pull up, they get me loose
Yeah, Jump Out boys, that's Nike boys, hoppin' out coupes
This shit way too big, when we pull up, give me the loot (Gimme the loot!)
Was off the Remy, had a Papoose
Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two-four hour lockdown, we made no moves
Now it's 4 AM and I'm back up poppin' with the crew
I just landed in, Chase B mixes pop like Jamba Juice
Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits
And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose

Yeah, this shit way too formal, y'all know I don't follow suit
Stacey Dash, most of these girls ain't got a clue
All of these hoes I made off records I produced
I might take all my exes and put 'em all in a group
Hit my eses, I need the bootch
'Bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo
Told her, ""Hop in, you comin' too""
In the 305, bitches treat me like I'm Uncle Luke
(Don't stop, pop that pussy!)
Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof, uh
She said, ""Where we goin'?"" I said, ""The moon""
We ain't even make it to the room
She thought it was the ocean, it's just the pool
Now I got her open, it's just the Goose
Who put this shit together? I'm the glue

Shorty FaceTimed me out the blue

Woo, woo
I pull up like
How you pull up, Baby? How you pull up? (Oh, oh, oh)
How you pull up? I pull up (Woo, SethInTheKitchen)

Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar? (Yeah)
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (Woo)
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me (Woo)
You better let me go the day you need me (Woo)
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (Woo)
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop

It's safe to say I earned it, ain't a nigga gave me nothin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm ready to hop out on a nigga, get to bustin'
Know you heard me say, ""You play, you lay,"" don't make me push the button
Full of pain, dropped enough tears to fill up a fuckin' bucket
Goin' for buckets, I bought a chopper
I got a big drum, it hold a hundred, ain't goin' for nothin'
I'm ready to air it out on all these niggas, I can see 'em runnin'
Just talked to my mama, she hit me on FaceTime just to check up on me and my brother
I'm really the baby, she know that her youngest son was always guaranteed to get the money (Okay, let's go)
She know that her baby boy was always guaranteed to get the loot
She know what I do, she know 'fore I run from a nigga, I'ma pull it out and shoot (Boom)
PTSD, I'm always waking up in cold sweats like I got the flu
My daughter a G, she saw me kill a nigga in front of her before the age of two
And I'll kill another nigga too
'Fore I let another nigga do somethin' to you
Long as you know that, don't let nobody tell you different
Daddy love you (Yeah, yeah)

Keep a Glocky when I ride in the Suburban

And I'm ballin', that's why it's diamonds on my jersey
Slide on opps' side and flip the block back, yeah, yeah
My junior popped him and left him lopsided, yeah, yeah
We spin his block, got the rebound, Dennis Rodman
Fool me one time, you can't cross me again
Twelve hundred horsepower, I get lost in the wind
If he talkin' on the yard, the pen' dogs'll take his chin
Maybach SUV for my refugees
Buy blocks in the hood, put money in the streets
I was solo when the opps caught me at the gas station
Had it on me, thirty thousand, thought it was my last day
But they ain't even want no smoke
If I had to choose it, murder what she wrote

This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels

Why am I so in love?
Why am I so in love?
Why am I so in love?
I don't know why

Steady tryin' to maintain
Same things that'll blow a bitch mind frame
My brain can't fathom what the hate say
He say, she say, how 'bout me say?
Get the Vis-a, headed to the islands A-S-A-P
What's that on my shawty wrist? That's a AP
I'm the type to save a bitch, C-A-P-E
Feelin' like ET, flyin' out of the Addy
Fuckin' on shawty, she baddie, casual convo then at it
I mean I'm better than better, maybe I'm lyin'
I'm sadder than most of y'all with the money and the freedom, nigga
What is money really worth if it ain't love?
I'ma find a perfect balance, it's gon' take time
I heard shawty still in love through the grapevine
Heard shawty still in love through the grapevine
Heard shawty in love through the grapevine

Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you

Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type

All my friends are toxic, all ambitionless
So rude and always negative
I need new friends, but it's not that quick and easy
Oh, I'm drowning, let me breathe
I'm better off all by myself
Though I'm feeling kinda empty without somebody else
Oh, I hear you crying out for help
But you never showed for me when I was ringing your cell phone
Oh, you don't know how it feels to be alone
Baby, oh, I'll make you know, I'll make you know, oh

Countin' my hours and knockin' on wood
Avoidin' my opposites, chewin' on chocolate

Be good for a minute, don't want to admit it

What a sight for sore eyes, brighter than a blue sky
She's got you mesmerized while I die

Why would you ever kiss me?
I'm not even half as pretty
You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester
But you like her better
(Wish I were Heather)

Watch as she stands with her, holding your hand
Put your arm 'round her shoulder, now I'm getting colder
But how could I hate her? She's such an angel

(Ah)

Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?
(World)
And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand new girl (Girl)

Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Well, good for you, I guess you're gettin' everything you want (Ah)
You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off (Ah)
It's like we never even happened
Baby, what the fuck is up with that? (Ah)
And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you? Well, screw that, and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do

I'm still a fan even though I was salty
Hate to see you with some other broad, know you happy
Hate to see you happy if I'm not the one drivin'

I'm so mature, I'm so mature
I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
I don't want none, I just want you
If I can't have you, no one should, I might

I might kill my ex, not the best idea
His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?
I might kill my ex, I still love him, though
Rather be in jail than alone

I get the sense that it's a lost cause
I get the sense that you might really love her
The text gon' be evidence, this text is evidence
I try to ration with you, no murders, no crime of passion
But, damn, you was out of reach
You was at the farmer's market with your perfect peach
Now I'm in amazement, playin' on my patience

My whole squad's in here, walking around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby ""The

Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia

In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (Ayy)

Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?

My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on the guy with a missile launcher

'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?

And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire

'Cause I caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her
Face in my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Cristhian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
So they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Hari Kari
'Cause e'ry Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em
Swearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (Monster)
Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets
Evil, that means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade
I'm finna kill 'em and dump all their fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me outta me
You don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
And be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you, bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable

Ugh, you're a monster

I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla
Better hit the deck like the card dealer
My whole squad's in here, walking around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby ""The
Brain"" Heenan which is probably the
Same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia
ADHD, Hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisier (Hey, hey)
In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (Ayy)
This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A
Laughing all the way to the bank, I spray flames
They cannot tame or placate the

Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled, did so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on the guy with a missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of vodka
When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a

'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
'Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long that
Even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how ya talkin' and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke, fool
I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the streetlight

We've been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We've been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise

Look at the situation they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the state
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watchin' got me chasin' dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
And my homies is down, so don't arouse my anger, fool
Death ain't nothin' but a heartbeat away
I'm livin' life do-or-die, what can I say?
I'm 23 now, but will I live to see 24?
The way things is goin', I don't know

We keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise

Power and the money, money and the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's runnin', but half of them ain't lookin'
It's goin' on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'
They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't, I guess they front
That's why I know my life is out of luck, fool

Yeah
I know sometimes
Things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey
What Daddy always tell you?
Straighten up, little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you cryin' about?
You got me

Hailie, I know you miss your Mom, and I know you miss your Dad
When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there, Daddy's wit' you in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears, Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Lainie, Uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
We're all we got in this world when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, Mama's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just somethin' we have no control over, and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream

Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright

Heh, it's funny
I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night crying
'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your Mom was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your Mama's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot
So Mama moved back on to Chalmers in the flat, one-bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre, and flew you and Mama out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Mama had to leave me
Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV
And Mama didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Mama developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house just reminiscin'
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Shh! Mama's only gone for the moment
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright

And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad! (Haha)403Embed","257 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçePortuguêsItalianoDeutschFrançaisالعربيةMockingbird Lyrics

There ain't no gold in this river
That I've been washin' my hands in forever
I know there is hope in these waters
But I can't bring myself to swim
When I am drowning in this silence
Baby, let me in
Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me

There ain't no room for things to change
When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways
You can't deny how hard I've tried
I changed who I was to put you both first
But now I give up
Go easy on mе, baby

Didn't get the chance to

Had no time to choose what I chose to do

A broken heart is all that's left
I'm still fixing all the cracks
Lost a couple of pieces when
I carried it, carried it, carried it home
I'm afraid of all I am
My mind feels like a foreign land
Silence ringing inside my head
Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home

I've spent all of the love I saved
We were always a losing game
Small-town boy in a big arcade
I got addicted to a losing game

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game

How many pennies in the slot?
Giving us up didn't take a lot
I saw the end 'fore it begun
Still I carried, I carried, I carry on

Well, you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go

Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home

Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast

Well, you only need the light when it's burning low

Naw, nana, bananana, nanananananana (Nana, ah-ah)
Alright, dada, dadadada

When I popped off then your girl gave me just a little bit of lockjaw
Baby so cold, he from the north, he from the Canada
Bankroll so low, I got nothing else that I can withdraw
Ran out the door
I shine my wrist, it go like shashasha, shashasha
I got your bitch singing, lalalala, lalala
I shine my wrist, it go like shashasha, shashasha
I got your bitch singing, lalalala, lalala
(How I stride like that)

Amex, no cap, eight hundred score
They wonder how (How I guap like that)
I rap my lyrics when I perform
They wonder how (How I stride like that)
Married to the grind, I brought my ring
I'm corny, but your girly want the dick
Modest with my jewels, but check the bank

Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up

I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

Hurt me with the word ""goodbye""?

Two trailer park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside
Two trailer park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside

Guess who's back? Back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back? Guess who's back?
Guess who's back? Guess who's back?
Guess who's back? Guess who's back?
Guess who's back
I've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to
See Marshall no more; they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (Hey!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me, so
Come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits, and get ready
'Cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, fuck you, Debbie!

'Cause it feels so empty without me

Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners, helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch!""
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, polluting the airwaves, a rebel
So just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass—you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, da-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in, and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter, I'm interesting
The best thing since wrestling, infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, ""Attention, please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents; my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?

Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You thirty-six-year-old bald-headed fag, blow me
You don't know me; you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene (Yeah)
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do Black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey!)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me

Never sold a bag but look like Pablo in a photo
This gon' make 'em feel the way like Tony killed Manolo
You already know though, you already know though
I walk in the corner with the money, on my finger
She might get it popping, I might wife her for the winter
I already know, already know, nigga roses
All I need is roses

Turn up baby, turn up, when I turn it on
You know how I get too lit when I turn it on
Can't handle my behavior when I turn it on
Too fast, never ask, if the life don't last
Done been through it all
Fuck with a nigga raw, this who you wanna be
And I know you won't tell nobody nothing
And I know you won't tell nobody no

Oh, the curtain of my heart, a spark of fire. This is my eyes from you
It is impossible to dispense with you, a look that satisfies me
In order, you will do yourself a favor, guide me, and listen
This is you, the magic of your eyes is greedy, so much in my eyes
Oh, the curtain of my heart, a spark of fire. This is my eyes from you
It is impossible to dispense with you, a look that satisfies me
In order, you will do yourself a favor, guide me, and listen
This is you, the magic of your eyes is greedy, so much in my eyes

I took care of you and you are in front of me forgetting my soul, my name and my words
This is exactly my dreams, I'm not looking and confused
And today our words are silent, tomorrow you will remain in my lap and in my house
This is what will determine it, and the moon will choose to install it
Oh, the curtain of my heart, a spark of fire. This is my eyes from you
It is impossible for me to dispense with a look that satisfies me
In order, you will do yourself a favor, guide me, and listen
This is you, the magic of your eyes, the greed of my eyes

Among people, beauty is measured if they answer your biography
And if they see your picture, then this is enough
Not clowning, gradually nostalgic, you have the magic of your difference
But I'm the one who revealed your paper, unpack it with me

Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)

Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches

Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'

Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no ""Mrs.""
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction

I can't turn my head off
Wishing these memories would fade, they never do
Turns out people lie
They said, ""Just snap your fingers""
As if it was really that easy for me to get over you

I just need time

Snappin' one, two

You're still in my heart
Snappin' three, four
Don't need you here anymore
Get out of my heart

أسئلة عايشة معايا مكملة والإجابة متأجلة
سلسلة وكل حلقة للتانية مِسَلِّمة
بلف في دايرة ومهما أبعد برجع هنا
بصيت في مرايتي لقيتها سودا ومضلمة
النفسية بعافية تعبانة، مدشملة
حطيت راسي في سجادتي حكيت لربي ع اللي جوايا
أنا أنا أنا أنا أنا شايل من زمان
أنا أنا أنا أنا في قلبي ألف سؤال
أسئلة كتير والضمير بياكل ويأنب فيا
زي الحمير حافظ طريقي ومغمي عنيا
وقعت في بير بنده وصدى صوتي مغطي عليا
صوت بيقول ممنوع وصوت يقولي إمشي ورا النية

يا أبيض يا أسود قصة حياتي وكل حكاياتي
مع إني عادي عادي أعيشها في النص رمادي
يا أبيض يا أسود قصة حياتي وكل حكاياتي
مع إني عادي عادي أعيشها في النص رمادي
يا أبيض يا أسود قصة حياتي وكل حكاياتي
مع إني عادي عادي أعيشها في النص رمادي
يا أبيض يا أسود قصة حياتي وكل حكاياتي
مع إني عادي عادي أعيشها في النص رمادي

القلب مات مع اللي فات
صرختي صوتها سكات
يأس كسرة وإحباط
طناش طناش وإستعباط
بعاد عن رب العباد
شيطان راكبني زي الجواد
درجن درجن روح هناك
أروح هناك تطلع سراب
بجري في سباق وأنا فيه متساق
والسواق بيدوس بغباء
قطيع والكل بيقول ماء ماء ماء ماء
زهقت يا ناس من النفاق والمجتمع الكداب
جريت على أقرب دولاب
عملت دماغ ودتني هناك
واللي زاد واللي غطا إتلطيت في الدنيا لطة
القطر فات وأنا في المحطة وكل يوم تتعاد اللقطة
السكر حراق وشطة والدماغ طلعت أونطة
واللي يغويك يتحكم فيك والغلطة بتجيب غلطة

Aisha Maaya's questions are complementary and the answer is deferred
A chain and every link for the second is Muslim
Blv in a circle and no matter how far back here
I looked in my mirror and found it black and dark
Psychological well-being tired, covered
I put my head in my carpet, I told God what was inside me
I, I, I, I have been carrying for a long time
I, I, I, I have a thousand questions in my heart
A lot of questions and the conscience eats and scolds me
Like donkeys, keep my way and pass out
I fell into Bir Panda and my voice echoed over me
A voice says forbidden and a voice tells me to walk behind the intention

Oh white, oh black, the story of my life and all my stories
Although I am normal, I live it in gray text
Oh white, oh black, the story of my life and all my stories
Although I am normal, I live it in gray text
Oh white, oh black, the story of my life and all my stories
Although I am normal, I live it in gray text
Oh white, oh black, the story of my life and all my stories
Although I am normal, I live it in gray text

The heart died with the past
My cry is silenced
Frustration and frustration
Tnash Tnash and frustration
Away from the Lord of the servants
Satan riding me like a horse
Dragon, spirit, there
I go there looking for a mirage
I'm running in a race and I'm in it
And drivers stomp stupidly
Flock and everyone says water water water water
I got bored, people, of hypocrisy and a lying society
I ran to the nearest wheel
I made a brain and put me there
And the one who increased and the one who covered, I had a lot in this world
The train has passed and I am at the station, and every day the snapshot is repeated
The sugar is burning and hot, and the brain turned out to be an ounce
And whoever seduces you controls you, and a mistake brings a mistake

I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today, I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around

And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do

Take you like a drug

You ask me what I'm thinking about
I tell you that I'm thinking about
Whatever you're thinking about (Ah)
Tell me somethin' then I'll forget
And you might have to tell me again
It's crazy what you do for a friend

Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you

Girl that you fucked with killed herself
That was this summer when nobody helped
And ever since then, man, I hate myself
Wanna fuckin' end it, pessimistic

Let's go below zero and hide from the sun
I'll love you forever where we'll have some fun
Yes, let's hit the North Pole and live happily
Please don't cry no tears now, it's Christmas, baby

Years ago, when I was younger
I kinda liked a girl I knew
She was mine and we were sweethearts
That was then, but then it's true

I'm in love with a fairytale
Even though it hurts
'Cause I don't care if I lose my mind
I'm already cursed


Every day, we started fighting
Every night, we fell in love
No one else could make me sadder
But no one else could lift me high above(high above)
I don't know what I was doing
When suddenly, we fell apart
Nowadays, I cannot find her
But when I do, we'll get a brand-new start

Yo, this one here goes out
To all my players out there, man
You know, that got that one good girl, dawg
That's always been there, man
Like, took all the bullshit
But then one day she can't take it no more
And decides to leave me

Yeah, I woke up in the middle of the night
And I noticed my girl wasn't by my side
Could've sworn I was dreamin'
For her I was feenin'
So I had to take a little ride
Backtrackin' on these few years
Tryin' to figure out what I do to make it go bad
‘Cause ever since my girl left me
My whole life came crashin', and I'm so…

وهقول عنك مواويل وهقول عنك حكايات
إزاي يا حبيبتي برغم البُعد مفيش بينا مسافات
قولنا هنتفارق يوم وبعدنا كده كام يوم
وبرغم البُعد ساعات برجع وبحن في يوم

وقالوا عليكي إن إنتي عينيكي قاسية ومفيش فيها مكان
يمكن حبيتي وروحتي وجيتي واتنسيتي مع الأيام
وقالوا عليكي إن إنتي عينيكي قاسية ومفيش فيها مكان
يمكن حبيتي وروحتي وجيتي واتنسيتي مع الأيام

وأنا لو على قلبي فحن عشانك فجأة ومال
وأنا مهما يقولوا بشوفك غير كل اللي اتقال
تسحرني عيونك لو قابلوني وأقول يا سلام
كان فين من بدري وجودك جمبي يا أحلى ملاك

وقالوا عليكي إن إنتي عينيكي قاسية ومفيش فيها مكان
يمكن حبيتي وروحتي وجيتي واتنسيتي مع الأيام
وقالوا عليكي إن إنتي عينيكي قاسية ومفيش فيها مكان
يمكن حبيتي وروحتي وجيتي واتنسيتي مع الأيام

وترد نجوم الليل تبعتلك السلامات

And I will say mawwal about you, and I will tell stories about you
How, my love, despite the distance, there are no distances between us
We said we will separate a day, and how many days after that
Despite the distance for hours, I will return with nostalgia in a day

And they told you that your eyes are hard and there is no place for them
My love, my soul, my presence, and my forgetfulness can happen with the days
And they told you that your eyes are hard and there is no place for them
My love, my soul, my presence, and my forgetfulness can happen with the days

And I, if on my heart, suddenly craved for you and money
And whatever they say, I see you other than all that was said
Your eyes enchant me if they meet me and say hello
Where was my early presence next to me, my sweetest angel?

And they told you that your eyes are hard and there is no place for them
My love, my soul, my presence, and my forgetfulness can happen with the days
And they told you that your eyes are hard and there is no place for them

It doesn't hurt me (Yeah, yeah, yo)

Do you wanna know, know that it doesn't hurt me? (Yeah, yeah, yo)
Do you wanna hear about the deal that I'm makin'? (Yeah, yeah, yo)

You
It's you and me

And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be runnin' up that road
Be runnin' up that hill
Be runnin' up that buildin'
Say, if I only could, oh

You don't wanna hurt me (Yeah, yeah, yo)
But see how deep the bullet lies (Yeah, yeah, yo)
Unaware, I'm tearin' you asunder (Yeah, yeah, yo)
Oh, there is thunder in our hearts (Yeah, yeah, yo)
Is there so much hate for the ones we love? (Yeah, yeah, yo)
Oh, tell me, we both matter, don't we? (Yeah, yeah, yo)

BLACKPINK, BLACKPINK
BLACKPINK, BLACKPINK

Kick in the door, waving the coco
팝콘 이나 챙겨 껴들 생각 말고
I talk that talk, runways I walk, walk
눈 감고 pop, pop 안 봐도 척
One by one, then two by two
내 손끝 툭 하나에 다 무너지는 중
가짜 쇼 치곤 화려했지
Makes no sense, you couldn't get a dollar outta me

자 오늘 밤이야
난 독을 품은 꽃
네 혼을 빼앗은 다음
Look what you made us do
천천히 널 잠재울 fire (Fire)
잔인할 만큼 아름다워
I bring the pain like

This that pink venom, this that pink venom
This that pink venom, get 'em, get 'em, get 'em
Straight to ya dome like woah, woah, woah
Straight to ya dome like ah, ah, ah
Taste that pink venom, taste that pink venom
Taste that pink venom, get 'em, get 'em, get 'em
Straight to ya dome like woah, woah, woah
Straight to ya domе like ah, ah, ah
You might also like
Black paint and ammo, got bodies like Rambo
Rеst in peace, please light up a candle, this the life of a vandal
Masked up and I'm still in CELINE
Designer crimes or it wouldn't be me (Ooh)
Diamonds shinin', drive in silence, I don't mind it, I'm riding
Flying private side by side with the pilot up in the sky
And I'm wildin', stylin' on them and there's no chance
'Cause we got bodies on bodies like this a slow dance

Don't even think about grabbing some popcorn

Close your eyes, pop, pop, pretend not to see
One by one, then two by two
It's all crumbling at the touch of my fingertips
It was gorgeous for a fake show
Makes no sense, you couldn't get a dollar outta me

I am a poisonous flower
after taking your soul

To handle all the selfish ways I'd spend my time without her
You're everything I want but I can't deal with all your lovers
You're saying I'm the one, but it's your actions that speak louder
Giving me love when you are down and need another

But I love you so (Ooh-ooh-ooh)

I got my red dress on tonight
Dancin' in the dark in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feelin' alive

Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore

Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?

We're gonna have a problem here...

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh!)
It's the return of the ""Oh, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said… nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Ha ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
""Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who,"" ""Yeah, but he's so cute though""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes—

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (Nope)
Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn about a GRAMMY?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?""
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh!)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me

I'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: ""How can kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, 'cause at the rate, I'm going, when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak

Can't take back the love that I gave you

You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last

When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true

Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable
So if you really wanna know

She just swallowed all my kids in the two-seat (Gag)

I get the breesh, then it's adiós
If I'm with your treesh, then she's giving throat
When I see police, then we getting low (When I see police)
That's another piece, that's another Zoe
Ice in the VV's, now she's down to get treeshy (Ice in the VV's)
I got all this water on me like FIJI
Bitch, I'm posted up with Hats and the Sleezys
Smokin' the Zaza, it goes straight to the māthā

Then he dancin' bachata

I gotta stick to this paper like loose leaf (Huh)
Bitch, I'm 'bout my chicken like it's a two-piece
You can have your bitch back, she a groupie
She just swallowed all my kids in the two-seat (Gag)
Swagged out
For Milly, we bringing them gats out (Gat)

They say I'm moving ruthless
And my shooters, they shootin'
I won't take her to Ruth's Chris (And my shooters, they shootin', ayy)

Hahahahaha
Tank God
Ayy, ayy

I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (Star, ayy, ayy)
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta ('Sta)
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, them the shottas ('Tas)
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grrra-ta-ta-ta (Ta, pow, pow, pow, ayy, ayy)

Switch my whip, came back in black
I'm startin' sayin', ""Rest in peace to Bon Scott"" (Scott, ayy)
Close that door, we blowin' smoke
She ask me light a fire like I'm Morrison ('Son, ayy)
Act a fool on stage
Prolly leave my fuckin' show in a cop car (Car, ayy)
Shit was legendary
Threw a TV out the window of the Montage
Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn
Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryna get in
Sayin', ""I'm with the band"" (Ayy, ayy)
Now she actin' outta pocket, tryna grab up on my pants
Hundred bitches in my trailer say they ain't got a man
And they all brought a friend (Yeah, ayy, ayy, ayy)
You might also like
I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (Star, ayy, ayy)
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta ('Sta)
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, them the shottas ('Tas)
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grrra-ta-ta-ta (Ta, pow, pow, pow)

I've been in the Hills fuckin' superstars
Feelin' like a popstar (21, 21, 21)
Drankin' Henny, bad bitches jumpin' in the pool
And they ain't got on no bra (Bra)
Hit her from the back, pullin' on her tracks
And now she screamin' out, ""¡No más!"" (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
They like, ""Savage, why you got a 12 car garage
And you only got six cars?"" (21)
I ain't with the cakin', how you kiss that? (Kiss that?)
Your wifey say I'm lookin' like a whole snack (Big snack)
Green hundreds in my safe, I got old racks (Old racks)
L.A. bitches always askin', ""Where the coke at?"" (21, 21)
Livin' like a rockstar, smash out on a cop car
Sweeter than a Pop-Tart, you know you are not hard
I done made the hot chart, 'member I used to trap hard
Livin' like a rockstar, I'm livin' like a rockstar (Ayy)
I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (Star, ayy, ayy)

عيني منها بشكل جِدي
وتقيلة مش تقلانة، إتبخّر سحري
ومش باجي على بالها ما فكرتشي
وبالي فيها بابا بالي مش ملكي (ولا باجي على بالها)
بلعب البخت (وبعدين؟)، سألتها ورفضتني
إستغربتها، أومال فين هيبتي؟
حبيبي أنا بضحك على خيبتي
يا أخي كنت على الثبات وهزّتني
واللي فات دا كان سحري
مش باجي على بالها إن جات سيرتي
أنا بالي معاها مش ملكي
قالت كلام قبل أما تشوفني
عارفني صعب ومش مفهوم
كلامي دبش ومش موزون
أو بتحب حد والبال مشغول
ما شوفتوهاش ولا حد يلومني
ملاك برئ ولا أنا مخدوع
هيا توتر ولا أنا مهزوز
أو أذاها حد والكل مرفوض

ولا إيه القصة حبيبي فيدني
اللي أذوك ياما حبيبي سيبني
أخلي اللي  جاي ورود وشموع
يتغنّالها وبصوت مسموع
ولا إيه القصة حبيبي فيدني
اللي آذوك ياما حبيبي سيبني
أنسيك ماضي كله دموع
ولا ما أقدرش أسيبك موجوع

سحرتني ولا سحرتلي

مش عايزة تجيبني بس جابتني

ونسيتني وفي قصتي حبستني

والله ووقعت، بفكر فيك كتير بالي عليك مشغول
وأنا بتصعب عليا حالي
وأنا بكتبلِك كلام معسول
بعيد عن عيني ويا عيني
مع غيري ومش مبسوط
دا أنا أضيّع عمري يا عمري
وأحبِك حب مش مشروط

لا تلاقي عندي وعود كدابة
وكبرت على ولا شئ مضمون
كلامي على قد اللي معايا
في الحب ما أستناش مردود
براحة على قلبي المكسور
اللي مشكلته إنه فيك مسحول
مين إختار اللي عينيك عملوه
دا مش ذنبي أنا صحيت محطوط
ولا إيه القصة حبيبي فيدني
اللي أذوك ياما حبيبي سيبني
أخلي اللي  جاي ورود وشموع
يتغنّالها وبصوت مسموع
ولا إيه القصة حبيبي فيدني
اللي آذوك ياما حبيبي سيبني
أنسيك ماضي كله دموع
ولا ما أقدرش أسيبك موجوع
ولا إيه القصة حبيبي فيدني
اللي أذوك ياما حبيبي سيبني
أخلي اللي  جاي ورود وشموع
يتغنّالها وبصوت مسموع
ولا إيه القصة حبيبي فيدني

Seriously, my eyes are on her
And heavy, not heavy, my magic evaporates
And I didn't come to her mind, I didn't think about it
And my mind has a daddy, my mind is not mine (I don't come to her mind)
Playing divination (and then two?), I asked her and she refused me
I surprised her, Omal, where is my prestige?
My love, I laugh at my disappointment
Brother, you were standing firm and you shook me
And what happened was magical
I don't want her to mind that my biography came
I mind with her not mine
She said the words before you see me
Do you know me, it is difficult and incomprehensible?
My words are messy and not balanced
Or you love someone with a busy mind
I didn't see it, and no one blames me
An innocent angel nor am I deceived
Come on tense and I'm not shaken
Or harmed by someone, and everyone is rejected

Or what is the story, my love?
Whoever hurts you, my love, will build
Leave the next roses and candles
He sings it out loud
Or what is the story, my love?
Whoever hurt you, my love, will build
I forget you, my past is full of tears
Nor can I leave you pained
You might also like
You charmed me or you charmed me
(You charmed me or you charmed me)
And eyes don't need to charm me
(And eyes don't need to bewitch me)
You don't want to answer me, but you answered me
(You don't want to answer me, you just answered me)
And you forgot me and in my story you locked me up

I swear I fell, I think about you a lot, I care about you busy
And I'm having a hard time right now
I am writing sweet words to you
Far from my eyes, oh my eyes
With others, I am not happy
I am wasting my life, my life
I love you unconditional love

You will not find false promises
And I grew up on nothing guaranteed
My words are as much as what is with me
In love, I don't want to return
Comfort on my broken heart
Whose problem is that Vic is enchanted
Who chose what your eyes did
This is not my fault, I woke up depressed
Or what is the story, my love?
Whoever hurts you, my love, will build
Leave the next roses and candles
He sings it out loud
Or what is the story, my love?
Whoever hurt you, my love, will build
I forget you, my past is full of tears
Nor can I leave you pained
Or what is the story, my love?
Whoever hurts you, my love, will build
Leave the next roses and candles
He sings it out loud
Or what is the story, my love?
Whoever hurt you, my love, will build
I forget you, my past is full of tears
Nor can I leave you in pain 5Embed",ar,"{'build', 'charmed', 'refused', 'divination', 'disappointment', 'omal', 'grew', 'incomprehensible', 'time', 'evaporates', 'happened', 'happy', 'lot', 'firm', 'hurt', 'past', 'surprised', 'sweet', 'angel', 'bewitch', 'busy', 'leave', 'biography', 'story', 'full', 'everyone', 'heart', 'life', 'false', 'answered', 'next', 'two', 'locked', 'right', 'rose', 'brother', 'enchanted', 'blame', 'fell', 'harmed', 'problem', 'tense', 'love', 'charm', 'answer', 'forget', 'magical', 'others', 'standing', 'deceived', 'swear', 'sings', 'mind', 'lyric', 'word', 'eye', 'daddy', 'seriously', 'pain', 'loud', 'depressed', 'care', 'far', 'chose', 'mine', 'whoever', 'contributorstranslationsenglishel', 'innocent', 'wasting', 'someone', 'comfort', 'shook', 'bakht', 'asked', 'broken', 'forgot', 'pained', 'heavy', 'magic', 'difficult', 'shaken', 'vic', 'unconditional', 'playing', 'find', 'hard', 'writing', 'laugh', 'balanced', 'tear', 'prestige', 'return', 'woke', 'messy', 'promise', 'candle', 'rejected', 'guaranteed', 'fault'}"

Brown guilty eyes and
Little white lies, yeah
I played dumb, but I always knew
That you talked to her, maybe did even worse
I kept quiet so I could keep you

And ain't it funny how you ran to her
The second that we called it quits?
And ain't it funny how you said you were friends?
Now it sure as hell don't look like it

You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah
You talked to her when we were together
Loved you at your worst, but that didn't matter
It took you two weeks to go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still a traitor

All the questions you used to avoid
Ain't it funny? Remember I brought her up

I think I, I think I finally
Found a way to forgive myself
From mistakes I made in my past
I think that's the first step, right?
You agree?

I've dug two graves for us, my dear
Can't pretend that I was perfect, leavin' you in fear
Oh, man, what a world, the things I hear
If I could act on my revenge, then, oh, would I?
Some kill, some steal, some break your heart
And you thought that I would let it go and let you walk
Well, broken hearts break bones, so break up fast
And I don't wanna let it go, so in my grave I'll rot
I've dug two graves for us, my dear
Can't pretend that I was perfect, leavin' you in fear
Oh, man, what a world, the things I hear
If I could act on my revenge, then, oh, would I?
Some kill, some steal, some break your heart
And you thought that I would let it go and let you walk
Broken hearts break bones, so break up fast
And I don't wanna let it go, so in my grave I'll rot

I take a look at my life and realize there's none left
'Cause I've been blasting and laughing so long that
Even my mamma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk
You know that's unheard of
You better watch how you talking, and where you walking
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip but I gotta loc
As they croak I see myself in the pistol smoke fool
I'm the kinda G that little homies want to be like
On my knees in the night
Saying prayers in the street light
Been spending most their lives living in the gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives living in the gangsta's paradise
They got the situation, they got me facing
I can't live a normal life
I was raised by the streets
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watching got me chasing dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loped out gangsta set trippin' banger
And my homies is down so gonna rouse my anger fool
Death ain't nothing but a heart beat away

I got black, I got white, what you want?
Hop outside a Ghost and hop up in a Phantom
I know I'm ’bout to blow, I ain't dumb
They try to take my flow, I take they ass for ransom
I know that I'm gone
They see me blowin’ up, now they say they want some
I got two twin Glocks, turn you to a dancer
I see two twin opps, leave 'em on a banner
And I got two thick thots, wanna link the gang, yeah

I got red, I got blue, what you want?
The Chanel or Balenciaga, Louis and Vuitton
She know I got the Fendi, Prada when I hit Milan
I needed me a die or rider, I need me the one
I started from the bottom, you could see the way I stunt
I want all the diamonds, I want that shit to weigh a ton
The opps, they tryna line me 'cause they hate the place I'm from
But them niggas don't know me, they just know the place I'm from
I got lots of shawties tryna pull up to my place
But you ain't want me last year, so just get up out my face
They all up in my inbox, so I know they want a taste
I know they want my downfall, lil' nigga, are you laced?

I don't wanna talk right now
I just wanna watch TV
I'll stay in the pool and drown
So I don't have to watch you leave
I put on Survivor just to watch somebody suffer
Maybe I should get some sleep
Sinking in the sofa while they all betray each other
What's the point of anything?

All of my friends are missing again
That's what happens when you fall in love
You don't have the time, you leave them all behind
You tell yourself, ""It's fine, you're just in love""

Don't know where you are right now
Did you see me on TV?
I'll try not to starve myself
Just because you're mad at me
And I'll be in denial for at least a little while
What about the plans we made?
The internet's gone wild watching movie stars on trial
While they're overturning Roe v. Wade

Sleazin' and teasin', I'm sittin' on him
All of my diamonds are drippin' on him
I met him at the bar, it was twelve or something
I ordered two more wines 'cause tonight, I want him

A little context if you care to listen
I find myself in a shit position
The man that I love sat me down last night
And he told me that it's over, dumb decision
And I don't wanna feel how my heart is rippin'
In fact, I don't wanna feel, so I stick to sippin'
And I'm out on the town with a simple mission
In my little black dress and this shit is sittin'

Just a heart broke bitch, high heels six inch
In the back of the nightclub, sippin' champagne
I don't trust any of these bitches I'm with
In the back of the taxi sniffin' cocaine
Drunk calls, drunk texts, drunk tears, drunk sex
I was lookin' for a man who was on the same page
Now it's back to the intro, back to the bar
To the Bentley, to the hotel, to my old ways

'Cause I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night
Doctor, doctor, anything, please
Doctor, doctor, have mercy on me
Take this pain away
You're askin' me my symptoms, doctor, I don't wanna feel

Toke this joint how I'm blowin' this steam
Back to my ways like 2019
Not twenty-four hours since my ex did dead it
I got a new man on me, it's about to get sweaty
Last night really was the cherry on the cake
Been some dark days lately and I'm findin' it cripplin'
Excuse my state, I'm as high as your hopes
That you'll make it to my bed, get me hot and sizzlin'
If I take a step back to see the glass half-full
At least it's the Prada two-piece that I'm trippin' in
And I'm already actin' like a dick, know what I mean?
So you might as well stick it in

Just a heart broke bitch, high heels six inch
In the back of the nightclub, sippin' champagne

I'll be naked when I leave and I was naked when I came, yeah
Out of reach, out of touch
Too numb, I don't feel no way
Toast up, so what?
Street small, but it go both ways
So, you'll run, yeah
But you'll never escape

Would you ever picture us? (Would you ever picture us?)

Every time I pull my hair
Well, it's only out of fear (Only out of fear)
That you'll find me ugly
And one day you'll disappear because
What's the point of crying?
It was nеver even lovе (It was never even love)
Did you ever want me?
Was I ever good enough? (Ever good enough?)

The perfect platform, like plats formed on king push head
I got knots, 9th, the ROC, the one you niggas should dread
If you just tunin' in, we been ahead all quarters
I'm at the point I turn down money, you niggas can't afford us
The price of my soul worth more than Michael Jackson choruses
We aimin' for the garden though we came through the florist
That's a come up, c'mon, I don't even know what the floor is
Thought I wouldn't when I would, I made a path through the forest
Like Chris Paul screamin', ""I wish that you knew God""
When the storm came I stood in the rain with metals and laughed hard
Like try me, nigga, I'm triggered, I gotta make bullet points
Album of the year, one of my greatest is my older joints
This a new one, the new ones, I really been in J's
That crib in Malibu, Flex, I really been in J's
Different circles, doordashin
""She really went commercial?"" They askin'
Yes I did, me and the homies all laughed and
No actin' nigga, as I sit on isosceles, flexin' my philosphies
Said I'd never crossover, I left them all with wobble knees
Put me in the Irving Plaza the way I went Kyrie in Brook-nam
A queen had to come and shake the shook ones, I feel like Ava Duvernay
It's time to put a wrinkle in niggas that think they shit is straight
In the words of Nip tha Great, I learned you niggas out of shape
You can't manipulate the marathon just like my nipple weight
Abreast of the situation, how y'all gon' boo Drake
Knowin' y'all wouldn't have a boo without Drake? Ha real shit
There I go again, must be smokin' that lala
Took the game by the balls and ain't have to show you my tatas
I been had respect from Jay, Big, beehive and Tata
Y'all was takin' Ls, I used them to spell Allah
That's God flow, Rakim, y'all be on that ra-ra
All cap, I called Kap, he ain't pick up receivers
Jay was kickin' game, I was open enough to receive it
Y'all was on my head, like not Rap? I can't believe it
Knowin' my moves would make sense one day, like Jason Weaver
Martin and Malcolm, Jay and Kap
Both them niggas, you know we need 'em, right?

In a relationship; save it, bitch!

Kiss my lips? Bitch, why ask?
Kiss my dick, get my cash?

That's about as far as your buddy goes
We'll be friends, I'll call you again

You don't want that, neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride, between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two?
I'd never love you enough to trust you
We just met and I just fucked you

I'd never let another chick bring me down
In a relationship; save it, bitch!
Babysit? You make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit
Girl, you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I tell a muhfuckin' slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's-her-face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass
Kiss my lips? Bitch, why ask?
Kiss my dick, get my cash?
I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out? I'll put you out
Won't get out? I'll push you out
Puss blew out, poppin' shit
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out

Do I still wish that it was you?
Perfect don't mean that it's workin'

And that's where I find a glimpse of us
And I try to fall for her touch
But I'm thinkin' of the way it was
Said I'm fine and said I moved on
I'm only here passing time in her arms
Hopin' I'll find a glimpse of us

Tell me he savors your glory
Does he laugh the way I did?
Is this a part of your story?

Maybe one day, you'll feel lonely
And in his eyes, you'll get a glimpse

Youngblood thinks there's always tomorrow
I miss your touch some nights when I'm hollow
I know you crossed a bridge that I can't follow
Since the love that you left is all that I get, I want you to know

That if I can't be close to you, I'll settle for the ghost of you
I miss you more than life (More than life)
And if you can't be next to me, your memory is ecstasy
I miss you more than life, I miss you more than life

Youngblood thinks there's always tomorrow

Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that this story ends

Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

Know that means I'll have to leave

I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

When the evening falls
And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well, it's eating me up inside
But we ran our course, we pretended we're okay
Now if we jump together, at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made

Then only for a minute

I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

I remember when I first noticed that you liked me back
We were sitting down in a restaurant, waiting for the check
We had made love earlier that day with no strings attached
But I could tell that something had changed, how you looked at me then

Kristen, come right back
I've been waiting for you
To slip back in bed
When you light the candle

And on the Lower East Side, you're dancing with me now
And I'm taking pictures of you with flowers on the wall
Think I like you best when you're dressed in black from head to toe
Think I like you best when you're just with me and no one else

Kristen, come right back
I've been waiting for you
To slip back in bed
When you light the candle

And I'm kissing you, lying in my room
Holding you until you fall asleep
And it's just as good as I knew it would be

I'm searchin' to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world that was smilin' when I turned

Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us

And the laughter in thе halls and the names that I've been called

I'm stayin' where nobody 'posed to be p-p-posted
Being a wreck of emotions
Ready to go whenever, just let me know
The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable
I'ma tell 'em, ""Hasta luego""
They wanna plot on my trot to the top
I been outta shape, thinkin' out the box, I'm an astronaut
I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe
And it matters more because I had it not
Had I thought about wreaking havoc
On an opposition, kinda shockin' they wanted static
With precision, I'm automatic quarterback
I ain't talkin' sackin', pack it
Pack it up, I don't panic, batter-batter up
Who the baddest? It don't matter 'cause we at your throat

Sunsets
We wander through a foreign town
Strangely, there's nobody else around
So you open your dress and show me your tits
On the swing set at the old playground

And when you go away, I still see you
With sunlight on your face in my rear-view

Sunsets
I wanna hear your voice
A love that nobody could destroy
Took photographs like Brautigan's book covers
That we both adored

And when you go away, I still see you
With sunlight on your face in my rear view
This always happens to me this way
Recurring visions of such sweet days

It starts with one
All I know
It's so unreal
Watch you go

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself of a time when I (I tried so hard)
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Actin' like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so (Got so far)
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me (In the end)
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when I

Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme to explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It's so unreal
You didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory

A club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go (Mm)

Drinkin' fast and then we talk slow (Mm)
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I'll give it a chance now (Mm)
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance and now I'm singin' like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead

Say, ""Boy, let's not talk too much""
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm

불꺼진 romantic all my life
내 주위는 온통 lovely day

그만 힐끗대고 말해줘요 hold me (Hold me)
다시 crying in my room
숨기고 싶어 (Say what you say, but I want it more)

Not rude, I'm just tryna be yo' dude
So what I gotta do just to see how that ass move?
So beautiful, sorry to be crude

Yo B, I'm makin' the next move
You know me, I'm nothing but just smooth
Low seats, I'm settin' the right mood
All these other rappers, they talking, they just food
Ayy, I'm talking to just you
You talking to one dude
You rockin' with one dude
And if I get it right, then I'll turn off the lights soon

Hey girl, you wanna be my world
Get showered with diamonds and some pearls?
Not trying to make you my night girl
I'ma treat you right like I'm a knight girl
Hey fam, I'm tryna be your man
Me talking to you is God's plan
No, I do not want a one night stand
Take you 'round the world, just grab on my right hand19Embed","38 ContributorsHex Lyrics
East and the west, I'm rackin' up all my bread, uh
Power on me, I'm feelin' just like a Tesla
Too much tree, the smoke is makin' my chest hurt
Girl on me, I'm thinking I should arrest her
Ayy, I'm thinking I should arrest
All night long she puttin' me to the test
Got a lot on, I'm tryna take off the rest
Cleaning up my lines, I say nothin' but the best

Hey girl, you're the cutest that I see
So bright I'm not using my visine
Gotta get it likely or I'm ending my life, see
So beautiful like outta my dreams
Hey boo, I'm hollering at you
Not rude, I'm just tryna be yo' dude
So what I gotta do just to see how that ass move?
So beautiful, sorry to be crude

We were good, we were gold
Kinda dream that can't be sold
We were right 'til we weren't
Built a home and watched it burn

Mm, I didn't wanna leave you, I didn't wanna lie
Started to cry, but then remembered I

I can buy myself flowers
Write my name in the sand
Talk to myself for hours
Say things you don't understand
I can take myself dancing
And I can hold my own hand
Yeah, I can love me better than you can

Can love me better, I can love me better, baby
Can love me better, I can love me better, baby

Paint my nails cherry-red
Match the roses that you left

I'm on a sugar crash, I ain't got no fuckin' cash
Maybe I should take a bath, cut my fuckin' brain in half
I'm not lonely, just a bit tired of this fuckin' shit
Nothin' that I write can make me feel good

Victim of the great machine, in love with everything I see
Neon lights surroundin' me, I indulge in luxury
Everything I do is wrong, 'cept for when I hit the bong
Hit the bong, hit the bo—, feel good
Feelin' shitty in my bed, didn't take my fuckin' meds
Hyperpop up in my ears, everything just disappears
Don't wanna be someone else, just don't wanna hate myself
I just don't wanna hate myself, instead I wanna feel good

I'm on a sugar crash, I ain't got no fuckin' cash
Maybe I should take a bath, cut my fuckin' brain in half
I'm not lonely, just a bit tired of this fuckin' shit
Nothin' that I write can make me feel good

Where to now?
Got the rest of my life just laid out
Got the rest of my life to fuck around
Got the rest of my life to make sound

(One, two, three, four)
Ooh, ooh

Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape

I just put my cum in her pussy, now it's wet

I used to jump off the back of the bus (Yeah), now I jump off of a jet (Yeah)
I used to tell the lil' baby, ""This us,"" then I got over the shit
I used to like her, but now that I love her
The way she was drankin' my spit
Your bitch cheatin', she under my cover, we cuddle and shit

Now shawty say she wanna suck on the tip
I'm 'bout it, baby, I want all four of your lips (I'm 'bout it)
Ex-college girl, she can suck up a ship
I eat molly and I take this bitch on a trip
Ayy, shawty, ayy, darlin', ayy, baby girl, suck my private
Close your eyes, it's just me and you and nobody
Ayy, suck it sideways, if we in public or the driveway (Hey)

You were the shadow to my light
Did you feel us?
Another star, you fade away
Afraid our aim is out of sight
Wanna see us alight

Where are you now?

Was it all in my fantasy?
Where are you now?
Were you only imaginary?

Where are you now?
Atlantis, under the sea, under the sea
Where are you now? Another dream
The monster's running wild inside of me
I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded

These shallow waters never met what I needed
I'm letting go, a deeper dive
Eternal silence of the sea
I'm breathing, alive

Но ты дура, ты дура, ты явно
В голове не мозги — это точно
Говоришь, быть хотела принцессой
У корыта разбитого снова ты стоишь
Но ты дура, ты дура, ты явно
В голове не мозги — это точно
Говоришь, быть хотела принцессой
У корыта разбитого снова ты стоишь

Вот как-то так, но никак иначе
Слезы на щеках, ты чё, дура, плачешь?
Дай угадаю, что с тобой случилось:
Пропустила сериал, простудилась?
Глаза б мои тебя не видели
Лучше бы тебя в роддоме забыли родители
Возомнила ты себя принцессой
Говоришь, что мы с тобой из разного теста
Думаешь, ты не такая, что ты необычная
Чем ты вообще можешь думать, тупица истеричная?
У тебя же вместо мозгов, как у Винни-Пуха —
Опилки, стравилки, о да, это плохо
Раскатай губу — закатай обратно
Уничтожь себя, сделай всем приятно
Хочешь повыше взлететь и на всех нагадить
Но гады сами успели на тебя нагадить
Ладно, детка, тебе спокойной ночи
Желаю тебе, чтобы всю ночь кошмары мучали
Ты заслужила это, мисс «Куриные мозги»
А я пошёл, а ты меня не ищи

Говоришь, быть хотела принцессой
У корыта разбитого снова ты стоишь

Снова тебя встретил. Как дела? Неплохо
У, да у тебя проблемы со слухом
А где твой бойфренд? Как у него дела?
Только я тогда не понял: это он или она
У тебя трубка звонит, подними, ответь
Вопросы беспонтовые, хоть ты на тот свет
Опаньки, да у тебя фонарик
И бойфренд у тебя снова  ботаник
Говорил тебе тогда — поехали со мной
Была бы щас другой, на тачке крутой
А так топчи трамвай в резиновых галошах
И вместо шубы — бабушкина телогрейка
Говоришь — я некрасивый. Говоришь — я небритый
Но и ты, извини меня, не Анджелина Джоли
А как Брэд Питт быть я и не хочу
А разве он похож на настоящего мачо?
Мне пора, дела у меня, с тобою тут стою
Я, конечно, мог тебя взять с собою
Но ты же, дура, ждёшь принца на белом коне
Удачи тебе, ха, удачи и мне
Но ты дура, ты дура, ты явно

But you are a fool, you are a fool, you are clearly
There are no brains in the head - that's for sure
You say you wanted to be a princess
At the broken trough again you stand
But you are a fool, you are a fool, you are clearly
There are no brains in the head - that's for sure
You say you wanted to be a princess
At the broken trough again you stand

Something like this, but nothing else
Tears on your cheeks, what are you, a fool, crying?
Let me guess what happened to you:
Missed the series, caught a cold?
My eyes would not see you
It would be better if your parents forgot you in the hospital
Do you think you are a princess
You say that you and I are from a different test
You think you're not that you're unusual
What are you even thinking, you dumbass hysterical?
You have instead of brains, like Winnie the Pooh -
Sawdust, bleed, oh yes, it's bad
Roll your lip - roll it back
Destroy yourself, make everyone happy
Do you want to fly higher and shit on everyone
But the bastards themselves managed to shit on you
Okay baby, goodnight to you
I wish you nightmares all night
You deserve it, Miss Chicken Brain
And I went, and you do not look for me
You might also like
But you are a fool, you are a fool, you are clearly
There are no brains in the head - that's for sure
You say you wanted to be a princess
At the broken trough again you stand
But you are a fool, you are a fool, you are clearly
There are no brains in the head - that's for sure
You say you wanted to be a princess
At the broken trough again you stand

Met you again. How are you? Not bad
Uh, yes, you have hearing problems.
Where is your boyfriend? How is he doing?
Only then I did not understand: it was he or she
Your phone is ringing, pick up, answer
Questions bespontovye, even though you are in the next world
Opanki, do you have a flashlight
And your boyfriend is a nerd again
I told you then - come with me
It would be different right now, on a cool wheelbarrow
And so trample the tram in rubber galoshes
And instead of a fur coat - grandmother's padded jacket
You say I'm ugly. You say I'm unshaven
But you, excuse me, are not Angelina Jolie
I don't want to be like Brad Pitt
But does he look like a real macho?
I have to go, I have things to do, I'm standing here with you
Of course I could take you with me
But you, fool, are waiting for the prince on a white horse
Good luck to you, ha, good luck to me too
But you are a fool, you are a fool, you are clearly
There are no brains in the head - that's for sure
You say you wanted to be a princess
At the broken trough again you stand
But you are a fool, you are a fool, you are clearly
There are no brains in the head - that's for sure
You say you wanted to be a princess
At the broken trough again you stand
But you are a fool, you are a fool, you are clearly


There are no brains in the head - that's for sure
You say you wanted to be a princess

I live inside my own world of make-believe
Kids screaming in their cradles, profanities
I see the world through eyes covered in ink and bleach
Cross out the ones who heard my cries and watched me weep

I love everything
Fire's spreading all around my room
My world’s so bright
It's hard to breathe but that's alright
Hush

Tape my eyes open to force reality (Oh no, no)
Why can’t you just let me eat my weight in glee?
I live inside my own world of make-believe
Kids screaming in their cradles, profanities
Some days I feel skinnier than all the other days
Sometimes I can't tell if my body belongs to me

Hush

Just wanna be care free lately, yeah
Just kicking up daisies
Got one too many quarters in my pockets

And she love women, she'll be gone by tomorrow

I'm a jealous boy, really feel like John Lennon
I just want real love, guess it's been a minute

Na-na, yeah

I saw you dancing in a crowded room (Uh)
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye

I don't know why I run away (Oh)
I make you cry when I run away (Oh)

Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another

Save your tears for another day (Oh)
Save your tears for another day (Mm)

Met you once under a Pisces moon
I kept my distance 'cause I know that you
Don't like when I'm with nobody else
I couldn't help it, I put you through hell

And you deserve someone better

One, two

It's been a couple months
That's just about enough time
For me to stop crying when I look at all the pictures
Now I kinda smile, I haven't felt that in a while
It's late, I hear the doorbell ringin' and it's pourin'
I open up that door, see your brown eyes at the entrance
You just wanna talk, and I can't turn away a wet dog

But, please, don't ruin this for me
Please, don't make it harder than it already is
I'm trying to get over this

I wish that you would stay in my memories
But you show up today, just to ruin things
I wanna put you in the past 'cause I'm traumatized
But you're not lettin' me do that, 'cause tonight
You're all drunk in my kitchen, curled in the fetal position
Too busy playing the victim to be listening to me when I say
""I wish that you would stay in my memories""
In my memories, stay in my memories
You might also like
Now I can't say ""Goodbye"" if you stay here the whole night
You see, it's hard to find an end to somethin'
That you keep beginning over and over again
I promise that the ending always stays the same

So, there's no good reason in make believin'
That we could ever exist again
I can't be your friend, can't be your lover
Can't be the reason we hold back each other from falling in love
With somebody other than me

I wish that you would stay in my memories
But you show up today, just to ruin things
I wanna put you in the past 'cause I'm traumatized
But you're not lettin' me do that, 'cause tonight
You're all drunk in my kitchen, curled in the fetal position
Too busy playing the victim to be listening to me when I say
""I wish that you would stay in my memories""
In my memories, stay in my memories

Since you came
I guess I'll let you stay
For as long as it takes
To grab your books and your coat
And that one good cologne
That you bought when we were fighting
'Cause it's still on my clothes, everything that I own
And it makes me feel like dying
I was barely just surviving
I wish that you would stay in my memories
But you show up today, just to ruin things
I wanna put you in the past 'cause I'm traumatized
But you're not lettin' me do that, 'cause tonight
You're all drunk in my kitchen, curled in the fetal position
Too busy playing the victim to be listening to me when I say

It was just two lovers
Sittin' in the car, listening to Blonde, fallin' for each other
Pink and orange skies, feelin' super childish, no Donald Glover
Missed call from my mother
Like, ""Where you at tonight?""
Got no alibi

I was all alone with the love of my life
She's got glitter for skin
My radiant beam in the night
I don't need no light to see you

Shine
It's your golden hour (Oh-oh-oh)
You slow down time
In your golden hour (Oh-oh-oh)

We were just two lovers
Feet up on the dash, drivin' nowhere fast, burnin' through the summer
Radio on blast, make the moment last, she got solar power
Minutes feel like hours
She knew she was the baddest
Can you even imagine fallin' like I did?
You might also like
For the love of my life
She's got glow on her face
A glorious look in her eyes
My angel of light
I was all alone with the love of my life
She's got glitter for skin
My radiant beam in the night
I don't need no light to see you

Shine
It's your golden hour (Oh-oh-oh)
You slow down time
In your golden hour (Oh-oh-oh)

Now we catch him at the chicken spot, up a couple chops
Pop that nigga with a hundred shots, ra-ta-ta-ta-ta

He thought we was gon' knuckle up, bitch, I don't box
And these niggas always talkin' shit, yadda-yadda-ya

Niggas always wanna chase clout, bitch, I am clout
Tell 'em get up out my face now 'fore I grrt

Play me like a dummy, like bitch, are you dumb?
Are you dumb, stupid, or dumb, huh?
Yeah, you got some money, but you still fuckin' ugly
Stupid, listen
When I talk, you better listen
We can make him dance, bachata
Slide over, do the cha-cha
Grrt, bah-bah
Make a nigga go adiós

Fresca, you nasty
Flame up, light it
They see me and get excited
