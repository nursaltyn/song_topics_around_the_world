Warum fickt ihr Kopf, Kopf?
Mein Kopf platzt, Gucci-Sandalen, ich trag' sie nur aus Trotz, Trotz
Trotzdem machen sie mir nach, kann's nicht glauben, lieber Gott
Gott sei Dank schützt du mich, wenn meine Wespe ma' wieder rollt
Wenn sie rollt (Brrm)
Bin auf dem Weg
Mit meinem Baby, sie sticht zu, geht besser aus dem Weg
Mit zehn PS in deine Stadt, es wird nicht angenehm
Zähl' auf meine Wespe und jetzt bringt sie euch zum Schafe zähl'n
Na-na-ne (Na-na-ne)
Eins-gegen-eins, er kriegt 'ne Bombe, ruft sein'n Bro
Aber vergisst, mein Abi boxt sein'n Abi
Cruis' mit offenen Haaren und hinter mir sitzt eine
Bitch like Barbie, Hood-Safari
Steig' auf die Speedfight, scheiß auf Kawasaki, let's go, Barbie
Kickdown, mit Siebzig auf eure Party (Brrm)

Sie machen Fotos, Taschen platzen, aber Apache bleibt gleich (Brrm)
Brudi, ich muss los, wenn die Roller wieder schrei'n (Brrm)
Reden mir von Koks und von Messerstecherei'n (Brrm)

Why are you fucking head, head?
My head is bursting, Gucci sandals, I only wear them out of defiance, defiance
Nevertheless, they imitate me, I can't believe it, dear God
Thank God you protect me when my wasp rolls again
When she rolls (Brrm)
I'm on my way
With my baby, she stabs, better get out of the way
With ten horsepower to your town, it won't be pleasant
Count on my wasp and now she'll make you count sheep
Na-na-ne (Na-na-ne)
One-on-one, he gets a bomb, call his bro
But forget, my Abi boxes his Abi
Cruis' with her hair down and one is sitting behind me
Bitch like Barbie, Hood Safari
Get on the speedfight, fuck Kawasaki, let's go, Barbie
Kickdown, seventy to your party (Brrm)

They take pictures, bags pop but Apache stay the same (Brrm)

Weil alle Jungs müssen mit
Ein bisschen Sekt für die Mädels

Kein Gesetz, keine Regeln
Lass uns Kohle verdien'n

(Don't stop, baby, you can walk through)
(Don't want, baby, think about you)
(You know that I'm never gonna lose)
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a—

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

Usually, I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today, I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but
You might also like
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I say goodbye

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Heat waves been fakin' me out

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around

I wanna take you somewhere so you know I care
But it's so cold and I don't know where
I brought you daffodils in a pretty string
But they won't flower like they did last spring
And I wanna kiss you, make you feel alright
I'm just so tired to share my nights
I wanna cry and I wanna love
But all my tears have been used up

On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
Up

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

And if somebody hurts you, I wanna fight
But my hand's been broken one too many times
So I'll use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude
Words, they always win, but I know I'll lose
And I'd sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna learn to love
But all my tears have been used up

(Happy Christmas)
Ah, ah-ah
Ooh-woah
Oh-oh

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do you recognise me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
""Happy Christmas,"" I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying, ""I love you,"" I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face of a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover, but you tore me apart

Never sold a bag but look like Pablo in a photo
This gon' make 'em feel the way like Tony killed Manolo
You already know though, you already know though
I walk in the corner with the money, on my finger
She might get it popping, I might wife her for the winter
I already know, already know, nigga roses
All I need is roses

Turn up baby, turn up, when I turn it on
You know how I get too lit when I turn it on
Can't handle my behavior when I turn it on
Too fast, never ask, if the life don't last
Done been through it all
Fuck with a nigga raw, this who you wanna be
And I know you won't tell nobody nothing
And I know you won't tell nobody no

You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?

I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand new girl (Girl)

You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Well, good for you, I guess you're gettin' everything you want (Ah)
You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off (Ah)
It's like we never even happened
Baby, what the fuck is up with that? (Ah)
And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you? Well, screw that, and screw you

Sommergewitter in mei'm Block, hör’ den Regen ganze Nacht

Meine Augen werden schwer, weil ich war zu lange wach

Letztes Jahr hatten wir nichts, aber jetzt ist es vorbei
Unsre Eltern kam'n mit zwei Taschen damals aus Türkei
Deshalb jag' ich das Papier in 'nem blauen Prada-Sweatshirt
Mein Kumpel aus Paris schreibt mir, dass man da mein'n Track hört
Stickle macht mir 'n Beat und dann mach' ich, was ich machen muss
Die Cops war’n bei RB, häng’ auf IG, hoffen, sie fassen uns
Sie kam'n alleine rein, weil seine Mama war nicht da
Sein Nachbar macht ihn’n auf – ist es überhaupt legal?
Konfigurier' mir ein'n Cayenne auf mein' alten iPhone 5
Sie hat gehört, ich werd’ erpresst, und sie fragt mich, ob es stimmt
Aber Baby, ich bin good, glaub mir, das ist alles Taf'

Summer thunderstorms on my block, hear the rain all night
I want butterfly doors and a panoramic roof
My area, my city, hear the rain all night
My eyes are getting heavy from being up too long
Summer thunderstorms on my block, hear the rain all night
I want butterfly doors and a panoramic roof
My area, my city, hear the rain all night
My eyes are getting heavy from being up too long

Last year we had nothing, but now it's over
Our parents came from Türkiye with two bags
That's why I'm chasing the paper in a blue Prada sweatshirt
My buddy from Paris writes me that you can hear my track there
Stickle makes me a beat and then I do what I have to do
The cops were at RB, hang on IG, hope they catch us
They came in alone because his mom wasn't there
His neighbor opens it - is it even legal?
Configure me a Cayenne on my old iPhone 5
She heard I'm being blackmailed and she's asking me if it's true
But baby, I'm good, believe me, that's all Taf'
And she texts me at two thirty on a warm summer night

Today the Ta7os control us because they think I'm ticking
And my team is always with me because I never forget you
Want an iced-out bottle of Saka water, VVS
And we're standing on the side of the road, greeting people we know
My couseng has a glizzy under his Casablanca shirt
My city green in summer, city boys, there are four of us
Gneisenau to Hermannplatz and we're guaranteed to press
And you meet me in my neighborhood, don't meet me in KaDeWe
Only ticked at Schlachtensee because I don't go swimming there
And you know I have no place in my heart
But I'll write to you at half past two on a warm summer night

Summer thunderstorms on my block, hear the rain all night
I want butterfly doors and a panoramic roof

A club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go (Mm)
Me and my friends at the table doin' shots
Drinkin' fast and then we talk slow (Mm)
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I'll give it a chance now (Mm)
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance and now I'm singin' like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, ""Boy, let's not talk too much""
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is fallin' too
I'm in love with your body
And last night, you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
Well, I'm in love with your body

One week in, we let the story begin
We're goin' out on our first date (Mm)
You and me are thrifty, so go all-you-can-eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate (Mm)
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doin' okay (Mm)
And leave and get in a taxi, and kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play and I'm singin' like

Girl, you know I want your love

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak

Put your loving hands out, baby
'Cause I'm beggin'

I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hands out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hands out, darlin'

Riding high when I was king
I played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything
I walked away, you won me then
But easy come and easy go and it would end

So anytime I bleed, you let me go
Yah, anytime I feed, you get me know
Anytime I seek, you let me know
But I planted that seed, just let me grow
I'm on my knees when I'm beggin'
'Cause I don't wanna lose you
Hey, yeah, ra-ta-ta-ta!

'Cause I'm beggin', beggin' you
Uh, put your loving hands out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you, ah
And put your loving hands out, darlin'

I need you to understand
Tried so hard to be your man
The kind of man you want in the end
Only then can I begin to live again

An empty shell, I used to be
The shadow of my life was hangin' over me
A broken man that I don't know
Won't even stand the devil's dance to win my soul

What we doin'? What we chasin'?
Why the bottom? Why the basement?
Why we got good shit, don't embrace it?

Riding high when I was king
I played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything
I walked away, you won me then
But easy come and easy go and it would end

So anytime I bleed, you let me go
Yah, anytime I feed, you get me know
Anytime I seek, you let me know
But I planted that seed, just let me grow
I'm on my knees when I'm beggin'
'Cause I don't wanna lose you
Hey, yeah, ra-ta-ta-ta!

Tried so hard to be your man

Only then can I begin to live again

An empty shell, I used to be
The shadow of my life was hangin' over me
A broken man that I don't know
Won't even stand the devil's dance to win my soul

What we doin'? What we chasin'?
Why the bottom? Why the basement?
Why we got good shit, don't embrace it?
Why the feel for the need to replace me?

Ayy, ayy

I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (Star, ayy, ayy)
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta ('Sta)
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, them the shottas ('Tas)
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grrra-ta-ta-ta (Ta, pow, pow, pow, ayy, ayy)

Switch my whip, came back in black
I'm startin' sayin', ""Rest in peace to Bon Scott"" (Scott, ayy)
Close that door, we blowin' smoke
She ask me light a fire like I'm Morrison ('Son, ayy)
Act a fool on stage
Prolly leave my fuckin' show in a cop car (Car, ayy)
Shit was legendary
Threw a TV out the window of the Montage
Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn
Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryna get in
Sayin', ""I'm with the band"" (Ayy, ayy)
Now she actin' outta pocket, tryna grab up on my pants
Hundred bitches in my trailer say they ain't got a man

They like, ""Savage, why you got a 12 car garage
And you only got six cars?"" (21)
I ain't with the cakin', how you kiss that? (Kiss that?)
Your wifey say I'm lookin' like a whole snack (Big snack)
Green hundreds in my safe, I got old racks (Old racks)
L.A. bitches always askin', ""Where the coke at?"" (21, 21)
Livin' like a rockstar, smash out on a cop car

Woo, woo
I pull up like
How you pull up, Baby? How you pull up? (Oh, oh, oh)
How you pull up? I pull up (Woo, SethInTheKitchen)

Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar? (Yeah)
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (Woo)
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me (Woo)
You better let me go the day you need me (Woo)
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (Woo)
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop

It's safe to say I earned it, ain't a nigga gave me nothin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm ready to hop out on a nigga, get to bustin'
Know you heard me say, ""You play, you lay,"" don't make me push the button
Full of pain, dropped enough tears to fill up a fuckin' bucket
Goin' for buckets, I bought a chopper
I got a big drum, it hold a hundred, ain't goin' for nothin'
I'm ready to air it out on all these niggas, I can see 'em runnin'
Just talked to my mama, she hit me on FaceTime just to check up on me and my brother
I'm really the baby, she know that her youngest son was always guaranteed to get the money (Okay, let's go)
She know that her baby boy was always guaranteed to get the loot
She know what I do, she know 'fore I run from a nigga, I'ma pull it out and shoot (Boom)
PTSD, I'm always waking up in cold sweats like I got the flu
My daughter a G, she saw me kill a nigga in front of her before the age of two
And I'll kill another nigga too
'Fore I let another nigga do somethin' to you
Long as you know that, don't let nobody tell you different
Daddy love you (Yeah, yeah)

Keep a Glocky when I ride in the Suburban

Slide on opps' side and flip the block back, yeah, yeah
My junior popped him and left him lopsided, yeah, yeah
We spin his block, got the rebound, Dennis Rodman
Fool me one time, you can't cross me again
Twelve hundred horsepower, I get lost in the wind
If he talkin' on the yard, the pen' dogs'll take his chin

Buy blocks in the hood, put money in the streets

Du sagst, es geht schon
Aber Baby, tut mir leid, wollt dir nicht wehtun
Mach' kein Wasser zu Wein, ich bin nicht Jesus
Doch hab' mit dir so viel vor, war noch nie so verlor'n
Wir sind so in love, dass es wehtut
Bist du nur einen Tag nicht da, dann hab' ich Sehnsucht, ja
Und ich weiß, du kommst nicht klar, wenn ich geh'n muss
Doch hab' mit dir so viel vor, war noch nie so verlor'n
Wir sind so in love, dass es wehtut
You might also like
So in love, dass es schmerzt, ja
Bin on top, doch will mehr, ja
Fühle nichts, Thilo leer, ja
Dich geh'n zu lassen ist trotzdem schwer
Unsre beste Zeit ist schon lange her
Doch trotzdem bleibst du, trotzdem weinst du
Egal, was ich tu', es ist verkehrt, ja
Ich vermiss' dich, wenn ich am Arsch bin
Ich vermiss' dich, kickt meine Panik
Doch bist du bei mir, geh' ich wieder dumm
Und treib' dich direkt in den Wahnsinn
Ich hab' Ice auf mir, ah
Doch das Einzige, was kalt ist, sind wir beide hier (Miksu)
Ja, ja (Macloud)

Ich weiß, du liebst mich und ich dich auch, ja
Du machst dir Sorgen wegen Drugs und Frau'n, ja
Ich sag', du kannst mir vertrau'n, doch weiß, du kannst es nicht
Und auch wenn Love schmerzt, ja, geb' ich sie nur an dich

Du sagst, es geht schon
Aber Baby, tut mir leid, wollt dir nicht wehtun
Mach' kein Wasser zu Wein, ich bin nicht Jesus

You say it's okay
But baby, I'm sorry, didn't mean to hurt you
Don't turn water into wine, I'm not Jesus
But I have so many plans for you, it's never been so lost
We're so in love it hurts
If you're not here for just one day, then I'm longing, yes
And I know you can't handle it when I have to go
But I have so many plans for you, it's never been so lost
We're so in love it hurts

We're so in love it hurts, ah
I don't like the way you are to me today
It was nice, now it hurts and I have to go now
Just gone, oh oh
You are the one in thousands, the one I need
Don't give me a break, take drugs and come home, yes
I lie in bed with you, but feel the emptiness here
I can't lose you, yes

You say it's okay
But baby, I'm sorry, didn't mean to hurt you
Don't turn water into wine, I'm not Jesus
But I have so many plans for you, it's never been so lost
We're so in love it hurts
If you're not here for just one day, then I'm longing, yes
And I know you can't handle it when I have to go
But I have so many plans for you, it's never been so lost

So in love that it hurts, yes
I'm on top, but want more, yes
Feel nothing, Thilo empty, yes
It's still hard to let you go
It's been a long time since our best time
But still you stay, still you cry
No matter what I do, it's wrong, yes
I miss you when I'm screwed
I miss you, kick my panic
But if you are with me, I'll go stupid again
And drive you straight insane
I've got ice on me, ah
But the only thing that's cold is the two of us here (Miksu)
Yes, yes (Macloud)

I know you love me and I love you too, yeah
You worry about drugs and women, yes
I say you can trust me, but I know you can't
And even if love hurts, yes, I only give it to you

You say it's okay
But baby, I'm sorry, didn't mean to hurt you
Don't turn water into wine, I'm not Jesus
But I have so many plans for you, it's never been so lost

And all I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach but I stand
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high waisted shorts, oh

She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no

'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love the taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside, it starts to pour

Wenn wir uns doch lieben
Warum tun wir uns weh-eh?
Ich weiß, ich hab's übertrieben
Doch will nicht, dass du geh-ehst
Du schreist mich an und ich geb' dir die Schuld
Und der Nachbar von oben wählt 110
Mann, wenn wir uns doch lieben
Warum tut es so weh-eh? (Ja, ah!)

Und wenn sie sagen, „Scheiß auf ihn, er hat 'n Schaden!“
Du kannst mich alles fragen und ich zeig' dir alle Karten
Du kannst dich auf mich verlassen, ich würd dich nie verlassen
Ja, ich wär da für dich, auch wenn dich alle hassen
Und ich würde mit dir alles teil'n, auch wenn ich wenig habe
Aber das ist keine Liebe, das ist Ehrensache
Bitches, die mich liken und mir schreiben
Ja, ich weiß, dass du das alles scheiße findest, aber es bleiben Bitches
Kein Plan, ich denke grade an dich
Ich will zeigen, was ich fühle, doch ich kann's nicht
Doch du sollst wissen, ich hab' keine böse Absicht
Deswegen schick' ich diese Nachricht

Warum tut es so weh-eh?

Bei uns ist bisschen anders, wir kenn'n uns seit dem Spielplatz
Nur wir zwei, damals schon im Jugendheim
Findest mich nicht komisch, weil ich ständig mit mir Krieg hab'
Du liebst mich, obwohl ich es am wenigsten verdient hab'
Mein Herz ist gebrochen und ich schreib's auf
Gläser fliegen, Tür'n knall'n, wenn wir fall'n und wir schrei'n laut
Deine Freundinnen, die hassen mich
Denn ich häng' besoffen in der Bar nächtelang und nehm' die Kasse mit
Weil du die ganze Nacht wartest, wenn ich draußen bin
Rauche Kippen, saufe Gin, aus den Augen, aus dem Sinn
Doch du sollst wissen, ich hab' keine böse Absicht
Deswegen schick' ich diese Nachricht

Wenn wir uns doch lieben
Warum tun wir uns weh-eh?
Ich weiß, ich hab's übertrieben
Doch will nicht, dass du geh-ehst
Du schreist mich an und ich geb' dir die Schuld
Und der Nachbar von oben wählt 110
Mann, wenn wir uns doch lieben
Warum tut es so weh-eh?
Ich vermiss', wie wir war'n
Eben war'n wir noch da
Und du lagst in mei'm Arm
Was hab'n wir getan?
Wir kommen nicht mehr klar
Warum ist es so hart?

Wenn wir uns doch lieben

If we do love each other
Why are we hurting each other-eh?
I know I overdid it
But I don't want you to go
You yell at me and I blame you
And the neighbor upstairs dials 110
Man, if we do love each other
Why does it hurt so much-eh? (yeah ah!)

And when they say, ""Fuck him, he's damaged!""
You can ask me anything and I'll show you all the cards
You can count on me, I would never leave you
Yes, I would be there for you, even if everyone hates you
And I would share everything with you, even if I don't have much
But that's not love, that's a matter of honor
Bitches who like me and text me
Yeah, I know you hate it all, but bitches stay
No plan, I'm thinking about you right now
I want to show what I feel, but I can't
But you should know that I have no bad intentions
That's why I'm sending this message

Why does it hurt so much-eh?

It's a bit different with us, we've known each other since the playground
Just the two of us, back then already in the youth home
Don't find me funny because I'm constantly at war with myself
You love me even though I least deserve it
My heart is broken and I'm writing it down
Glasses fly, doors bang when we fall and we scream loudly
Your girlfriends, they hate me
Because I hang drunk in the bar all night and take the register with me
'Cause you wait all night when I'm out
Smoke butts, sip gin, out of sight, out of mind
But you should know that I have no bad intentions
That's why I'm sending this message

If we do love each other
Why are we hurting each other-eh?
I know I overdid it
But don't want you to go-eh
You yell at me and I blame you
And the neighbor upstairs dials 110
Man, if we do love each other
Why does it hurt so much-eh?
I miss how we were
We were just there
And you lay in my arm
What have we done?
We can't get along anymore
why is it so hard

If we do love each other
Why are we hurting each other-eh?
I know I overdid it
But don't want you to go-eh
You yell at me and I blame you

Denk' mir so: „Nö, aber das Natz ist so ölig“ (Ja)
Mache weiter Schnapp, weil sie schnappen mich eh nicht (Niemals)
Stapel' so viel Batzen wie möglich (Ja)
Eins (Bam), zwei (Bam), drei Dinger Flex (Ja)
Sie zahl'n für ein Ganzes, doch kriegen 0,6 (Haha)
Direkt hier vom Hafen und niemals gestreckt (Niemals)
Mein Handy schon wieder besetzt (Brrt)

Die Taschen voll mit Geld wegen Kokain
Das Taxi wird bestellt, sie haben Bock zu zieh'n
Meine ganze Stadt betäubt von dem glänzenden Zeug
Hotpants werden feucht, komm und kauf was von mir
Flieg' auf die Bahamas wegen Kokain
Liegen flach im Wasser wie ein Krokodil
Jeder hier ist Freund von dem glänzenden Zeug

Hahahaha (La-dee-da-da-da-da-da-da)
(ahh)

Pockets full of cocaine money
The taxi is ordered, they feel like pulling it
My whole town is stunned by the shiny stuff
Hotpants get wet, come and buy something from me (Yes)
Fly to the Bahamas for cocaine
Lying flat in the water like a croc (Yeah)
Everyone here is a fan of the shiny stuff
New Benz, new gold, you need paper for that

Jaws numb, they come out of the matrix (Ah-ah)
Glasses on, because the eyes are smarties
Is sold, but nothing is used here
Make cash with the team, spend it at Atramis
Pop the joint 'cause it smells like Amnesia (Ah-ah)
Sun tans, trained like Vegeta (Ah-ah)
Five house, I'm in my favela
She dances for a gram of macarena
Yes, she does everything for me
The main thing is that I put her Natz on the table
Once and she's beaming
I analyzed them, all mathematics, yes, yes
You might also like
Pockets full of cocaine money
The taxi is ordered, they feel like pulling it
My whole town is stunned by the shiny stuff
Hotpants get wet, come and buy something from me
Fly to the Bahamas for cocaine
Lying flat in the water like a crocodile
Everybody here is a friend of the shiny stuff (Yeah)
New Benz, new gold

What a party! (bloh) rain of money falls
Stand in front of my reflection and cum on myself (Haha)
Will Ferraris (Wrmm), black, red and yellow (Yes)
Cocaine-fed instead of bread for the world, ey
So why complicated? It can also just walk
Your wife, she comes to me because she wants to smoke stones
I fixed them all like they were on a pyre
Always just enough so that no one dies, they should keep buying
When I'm there, the junkies start sweating
And I don't give a shit if they start injecting themselves
Bunker' fifty bullets in the fanny pack
I'm just out for a win again, yes

Pockets full of cocaine money
The taxi is ordered, they feel like pulling it
My whole town is stunned by the shiny stuff
Hotpants get wet, come and buy something from me
Fly to the Bahamas for cocaine
Lying flat in the water like a crocodile
Everyone here is a fan of the shiny stuff
New Benz, new gold, you need paper for that
They ask: ""Gzuz, Digga, do you need that?"" (Yes)
Think like this: ""No, but the Natz is so oily"" (Yes)
Keep snapping 'cause they ain't gonna snap me (never)
Stack as many chunks as possible (Yes)
One (Bam), two (Bam), three things Flex (Yeah)
You pay for a whole, but you get 0.6 (Haha)
Right here from the port and never stretched (Never)
My phone busy again (Brrt)

Tell me somethin', girl
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?

I'm fallin'
In all the good times, I find myself longin'
For change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryna fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?

I'm falling
In all the good times, I find myself longing
For change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us

I caught it bad yesterday
You hit me with a call to your place
Ain't been out in a while anyway
Was hopin' I could catch you throwin' smiles in my face
Romantic talkin'? You don't even have to try
You're cute enough to fuck with me tonight
Lookin' at the table, all I see is weed and white
Baby, you livin' the life, but nigga, you ain't livin' right

Cocaine and drinkin' with your friends
You live in the dark, boy, I cannot pretend
I'm not fazed, only here to sin
If Eve ain't in your garden, you know that you can

Call me when you want, call me when you need
Call me in the morning, I'll be on the way

Call me out by your name, I'll be on the way like

A sign of the times every time that I speak
A dime and a nine, it was mine every week
What a time, an incline, God was shinin' on me
Now I can't leave
And now I'm actin' hella elite
Never want the niggas that's in my league
I wanna fuck the ones I envy, I envy

Savage love (685, baby)

If I woke up without ya, I don't know what I would do
Thought I could be single forever till I met you
Usually don't be fallin', be fallin', fallin' fast
You got a way of keepin' me comin' back-to-back
I just found out, the only reason that you lovin' me
Was to get back at your ex lover but before you leave
Usually I would never, would never even care
Baby, I know she creepin', I feel it in the air

Every night and every day (Every day)
I try to make you stay, but your

Savage love
Did somebody, did somebody break your heart?
Lookin' like an angel, but your savage love
When you kiss me, I know you don't give two fucks
But I still want that

Your savage love

Mach' den Lieferwagen auf, Kugeln liegen schon im Lauf
Wallah, ich geh' über Leichen, doch nie wieder in den Bau, rrah
Im Jogginganzug von Milan
Lila in der Tasche und wir rollen im Beamer
Kunden rufen an und ich muss sie beliefern
Wahre Brüder fallen, Libanon, Ukraina – rrah, rrah!

Doch kann nicht kiffen, ich komm' grade von der Prophylaxe
Es riecht nach Olympéa Paco Rabanne

The filthy cop stops me, I didn't steal anything
Plan an escape via Holland or Poland
I've got alcohol in my blood, about sixty thousand in Levi's
And the police officer only leaves me the last fag
I'm banging antisocial, the voice, it's rough
Broken nose again, eyes purple, green and blue
Open the van, bullets are already in the barrel
Wallah, I'll walk over dead bodies, but never again in the den, rrah
In a jogging suit by Milan
Purple in the bag and we roll in the beamer
Customers call and I have to deliver to them
True brothers fall, Lebanon, Ukraina - rrah, rrah!
A hundred grams of hash in your pocket

I look up from the ground
To see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me
And I see there's something you're trying to hide
And I reach for your hand but it's cold
You pull away again
And I wonder what's on your mind
And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble and your voice begins to break
You say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's
They were my mate's
And I feel the colour draining from my face

And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be alright""

So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent
And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head
And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone
And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on
But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
But I just wanna stay

So bottoms up, let's forget tonight
You'll find another and you'll be just fine
Let her go""

But nothing heals the past like time
And they can't steal
The love you're born to find
But nothing heals the past like time
And they can't steal
The love you're born to find

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
""Let It Snow"" is blasting out
But I won't get in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's

True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day, I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold

I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today, I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around

And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you

Red lights, stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing

God, I'm so blue, know we're through
But I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone

I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today, I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around

And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you
You might also like
And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one, oh
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

Red lights, stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue, know we're through
But I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone

Obie Trice, real name, no gimmicks *record scratch*

Two trailer park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside
Two trailer park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside
(Woo!) (Ooh-ooh-ooh)

Guess who's back? Back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back? Guess who's back?
Guess who's back? Guess who's back?
Guess who's back? Guess who's back?
Guess who's back
I've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to
See Marshall no more; they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (Hey!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me, so
Come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits, and get ready
'Cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, fuck you, Debbie!

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners, helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch!""
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, polluting the airwaves, a rebel
So just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass—you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, da-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in, and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter, I'm interesting
The best thing since wrestling, infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, ""Attention, please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents; my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit-for-tat wit'
Anybody who's talking ""This shit, that shit""
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You thirty-six-year-old bald-headed fag, blow me
You don't know me; you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene (Yeah)
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do Black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey!)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy

Is the hope of Janice and Jen

Weißt du noch, als wir am Meer war'n?
Baby, wie lang ist es schon her, als
Du meintest, du wirst immer bei mir bleiben? Und das Meersalz
Hat so geglitzert auf der braunen Haut, noch mehr als
Unsre beiden Augen, weil das Leben zu uns fair war
Wir haben gefickt und der Himmel war so stern'nklar
Ich vermisse dich, vermisse ohne Schwerkraft
Mit dir rumzuschweben, der Absturz war so schmerzhaft
Ich muss mich ablenken, muss wieder Musik machen
Guck mir zu, ich füll' ab heut alleine meine Brieftasche
„Aber was schreibe ich bloß?“, frag' ich mich
Diese Wohnung ist auf einmal so groß ohne dich
Alle unsre Wünsche haben wir zerstört
Steige wieder in den Tourbus und ich riech' an deinem Shirt
Mal sehen, ob der Duft noch bleibt
Bis ich wieder aus dem Bus aussteig'

Wie kann man jemand so krass vermissen
Wie ich dich in diesem scheiß Augenblick?
Ich bin grade so krass zerrissen
Soll ich dir einfach wieder schreiben oder nicht?
Wie kann man jemand so krass vermissen

Denn mir ist klar, es wird nie mehr, wie es war
Es ist nachts, ich bin wach und ich denk' an dich

Do you remember when we were at the sea?
Baby how long has it been since
You mean you'll always stay with me? And the sea salt
It glittered so much on the brown skin, even more than
Both of our eyes, because life was fair to us
We fucked and the sky was so starry
I miss you, miss without gravity
Floating around with you, the crash was so painful
I have to distract myself, I have to start making music again
Watch me, I'll fill my wallet alone today
""But what am I writing?"" I ask myself
This apartment is suddenly so big without you
We have destroyed all our desires
Get back on the tour bus and I'll smell your shirt
Let's see if the scent stays
Until I get off the bus again

How can you miss someone so badly
Like me you in this fucking moment?
I'm so torn right now
Should I just text you again or not?

And I realize that I'm alone without you
Dark circles are reflected in my glass
I let you go like a coward
And I'm waiting for a signal
Just one last time, but that doesn't change anything
Because I know it will never be the same again
It's at night, I'm awake and I'm thinking of you

You broke me first

Maybe you don't like talking too much about yourself
But you shoulda told me that you were thinking 'bout someone else
You're drunk at a party or maybe it's just that your car broke down
Your phone's been off for a couple of months, so you're calling me now
I know you, you're like this
When shit don't go your way, you needed me to fix it
And like me, I did
But I ran out of every reason

Now suddenly, you're asking for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first
You broke me first

Took a while, was in denial when I first heard
That you moved on quicker than I could've ever, you know that hurt
Swear for a while, I would stare at my phone just to see your name
But now that it's there, I don't really know what to say

Es expandiert
Man spielt uns in Phuket, Ibiza, Budapest und es rasiert (Ahh), ahh

Ah! Wir war'n die Ersten (Ja, Mann)
Die Ersten in Deutschland, Platin der Stempel (Ja, Mann)
Plötzlich war'n Gangster am tanzen auf westafrikanischem Sample
Für sie war die Mucke nur Coco Jambo
Doch sah'n dann im Club: alle Frauen geh'n ab
Früher war'n ich und mein Kroko so broke
Heute hat Kroko ein Haus geschnappt
Schnapp, schnapp, schnapp
Ficke Prominente aus der Upperclass
Denn sie alle wollen Flaschen, Para, Schwanz
Egal, ob Camora oder Alabas
Also tanz, tanz, tanz
Noch 'n bisschen zu dem Beat für dein Snapchat
Es werden neidische Blicke geerntet
Doch es gibt kein'n Stress, du bist niemals Chef

We couldn't turn around 'til we were upside down
I'll be the bad guy now, but know I ain't too proud
I  couldn't be there even when I tried
You  don't believe it, we do this every time

Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed  the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm  waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go
I said so, I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex though, the sex though
And I still hear the echoes (The echoes)

Get 'em; what it is? What it does? What it is? What it isn't?
Looking for a better way to get up outta bed
Instead of getting on the Internet
And checking on who hit me, get up
Thrift shop, pimp-strut walkin'
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Sweater game, nope, nope, y'all can't copy, yeah
Bad, moonwalking, this here is our party
My posse's been on Broadway, and we did it our way
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones
Into everything I record to it and yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit, hustlin'
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen
With the four-track, bussin'
Halfway 'cross that city with the back (Back) pack (Pack), fat (Fat) cat (Cat), crushin'
Labels out here, now they can't tell me nothin' (Hey, hey, hey)
We give that to the people, spread it across the country (Hey, hey, hey, oh)

Go hard like I got a 808 in my heartbeat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on Shark Week, raw
Time to go off, I'm gone
Deuces, goodbye, I got a world to see
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer
Nah, I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Now, sing a song, and it goes like
Raise those hands, this is our party (Hey, hey, hey)

Wenn die andern aus dem Haus geh'n
(Miksu)
(Macloud)

Ich komm' erst nach Hause, wenn die andern aus dem Haus geh'n
Schlafrhythmus gefickt, ich seh' die Sonne immer aufgeh'n
Babe, ich bin verliebt in deine Art und in dein Ausseh'n
Kannst du mich nach Haus bring'n? Ich kann kaum noch gradeaus seh'n

Weil ich bin nachts wach, fucked up, Babe, ich weiß, du hasst das
Ich hitt' meinen Plug up, frag' ihn, ob er bisschen Hasch hat
Weiß nicht, was ich mir gedacht hab'
Ich schmeiß' alles weg, nur weil ich's selber in der Hand hab'
Ja, ich bin nachts wach, fucked up, Babe, ich weiß, du hasst das
Ich hitt' meinen Plug up, frag' ihn, ob er bisschen Hasch hat
Weiß nicht, was ich mir gedacht hab'
Ich schmeiß' alles weg, nur weil ich's selber in der Hand hab'

Ich hab' tiefe Augenringe, ja, wegen tausend Dinge
Ich glaub', ich werd' okay, auch wenn ich grade nicht so klinge
Ich hab' so viel durch, also kein Wunder, dass ich singe
Sie sagt mir, sie liebt mich und den Schmerz in meiner Stimme
Ah, ich such' die Hölle in mei'm Himmel
Ja, mein Baby scharf wie eine Klinge
Meine Sicht ist jeden Abend am verschwimm'n
Und ich glaube, da hilft vieles, aber leider keine Brille

Ich trink' den Gin, als ob es Wasser wär
Wunden viel zu tief, ja, ich glaub', da hilft kein Pflaster mehr, ah
Ich bin ziemlich voll, doch fühl' mich immer leer
Wann ich das letzte Ma' zuhaus war? Ist schon lange her

Weil ich bin nachts wach, fucked up, Babe, ich weiß, du hasst das
Ich hitt' meinen Plug up, frag' ihn, ob er bisschen Hasch hat
Weiß nicht, was ich mir gedacht hab'
Ich schmeiß' alles weg, nur weil ich's selber in der Hand hab'
Ja, ich bin nachts wach, fucked up, Babe, ich weiß, du hasst das

Weiß nicht, was ich mir gedacht hab'
Ich schmeiß' alles weg, nur weil ich's selber in der Hand hab'

Ich bin nachts wach, paff'-paff', pass' out mit der Mannschaft
Ich steig' aus dem Uber, grüß' mein'n Bruder mit ei'm Handschlag
Brauch' keinen Schlaf mehr, weil ich Träume jeden Tag jag'
Dankbar für was ist und auch kaputt von was ma' war, ja

Ich misch' Gefühle mit dem Alk und all dem andern Scheiß
Ja, sie nenn'n mich makko, obwohl ich eigentlich ganz anders heiß'
Ich bin nie da, das tut mir anders leid, ja
Und wenn ich morgen heimkomm', Baby, dann safe anders high
Weil ich bin nachts wach, fucked up, Babe, ich weiß, du hasst das

When the others leave the house
(Miksu)

I only come home when the others leave the house
Sleep rhythm fucked, I always see the sun rising
Babe, I'm in love with your style and your looks
can you take me home I can hardly see straight ahead

'Cause I'm up at night, fucked up, babe I know you hate this
I hit my plug up, ask him if he has some hash
Don't know what I was thinking
I throw everything away just because I have it in my own hands
Yeah I'm up at night, fucked up, babe I know you hate that
I hit my plug up, ask him if he has some hash
Don't know what I was thinking
I throw everything away just because I have it in my own hands

I have dark circles under my eyes, yes, because of a thousand things
I think I'll be okay, even if I don't sound like it right now
I've been through so much, so no wonder I'm singing
She tells me she loves me and the pain in my voice
Ah, I'm looking for hell in my sky
Yes, my baby sharp as a blade
My vision is blurry every evening
And I think a lot of things help, but unfortunately no glasses

I drink the gin like it's water
Wounds way too deep, yes, I think there's no band-aid to help, ah
I'm pretty full, but I always feel empty
When was the last time I was at home? It's been a long time

'Cause I'm up at night, fucked up, babe I know you hate this
I hit my plug up, ask him if he has some hash
Don't know what I was thinking
I throw everything away just because I have it in my own hands
Yeah I'm up at night, fucked up, babe I know you hate that
I hit my plug up, ask him if he has some hash
Don't know what I was thinking
I throw everything away just because I have it in my own hands

I'm up at night, puff-puff, pass out with the team
I get out of the Uber, greet my brother with a handshake
I don't need any more sleep because I chase dreams every day
Grateful for what is and also broken by what ma' was, yes

I mix feelings with the booze and all that other shit
Yes, they call me makko, although my name is actually quite different
I'm never there, I'm sorry otherwise, yes
And when I come home tomorrow, baby, then safe differently high
'Cause I'm up at night, fucked up, babe I know you hate this
I hit my plug up, ask him if he has some hash

Ja, Baby, ich glaub', ohne dich komm' ich nicht klar
Ich bin nicht nüchtern, nüchtern bin ich nicht einmal
Und ich lüg' dich an, ich glaub', ich hab' keine Wahl
Ein Schritt zurück, ich komm' nicht hinterher
Ich frag' mich, was du machst

Ich nehm' dich mit, Girl, ich nehm' dich mit zu mir nach Haus
Nur wenn du achtzehn bist, dann geb' ich dir ein'n aus
Sie ist nicht schüchtern, ja, und ihr Hintern geht aufs Haus
Ey, ja, sie splifft auch und sie hat für mich ein'n gebaut (Ey)
Mädchen komm'n, Mädchen geh'n, guck, ich dreh' (Ja, die geh'n)
Ich bin drauf, halt' mich wach, guck, ich steh' (Guck, ich dreh')
Arrogant, jung und wild bin ich eh (Bin ich eh)
Mach' den Job, hol' dis Geld und ich geh' (Und ich geh')

Ja, Baby, ich glaub', ohne dich komm' ich nicht klar
Ich bin nicht nüchtern, nüchtern bin ich nicht einmal
Und ich lüg' dich an, ich glaub', ich hab' keine Wahl
Ein Schritt zurück, ich komm' nicht hintеrher

Du willst mich mitnehm'n, komm vorbei, wеnn du dich traust
Ich bin jetzt achtzehn, nein, die schmeißen uns nicht raus
Ich bin dein Wingman, check' für Kasi eine aus
Und was für Spliffs dreh'n? Mit den Nägeln kann ich dir kein'n bau'n
Hundert Shots, Bubble-Butts, bin in jede verliebt
Oh my God, wie sie's macht, nein, wir reden nicht viel
Machen Krach ganze Nacht, sodass jeder uns sieht
Und wenn dein Girl mir gefällt, ja, dann nehm' ich mir sie

Hör' meine Lieder im Club
Kasi ist wieder ma' druff
Sie sagt: „Du siehst aus wie ein Star“
Ach, hast du das noch nicht gewusst?
Ich weiß, du kommst nicht darauf klar
Doch, was sie dir sagen, ist wahr
Für diesen Arsch musst du bezahl'n

Yes, baby, I don't think I can do without you
I'm not sober, I'm not even sober
And I lie to you, I think I have no choice
One step back, I can't keep up
I wonder what you're doing

I'll take you, girl, I'll take you to my house
I'll only buy you one if you're eighteen
She's not shy, yes, and her bum's on the house
Ey, yes, she also spliffs and she built one for me (Ey)
Girls come, girls go, look, I'm shooting (yes, they're going)
I'm on it, keep me awake, look, I'm standing (look, I'm turning)
I'm arrogant, young and wild anyway (I am anyway)
Do the job, get the money and I'll go (And I'll go)

Yes, baby, I don't think I can do without you
I'm not sober, I'm not even sober
And I lie to you, I think I have no choice
One step back, I can't keep up

I'm eighteen now, no, they won't throw us out
I'm your wingman, check out one for Kasi
And what kind of spliffs do you shoot? I can't build you one with nails
Hundred shots, bubble butts, in love with every one
Oh my god, how she does it, no, we don't talk much
Make noise all night so everyone sees us
And if I like your girl, yes, then I'll take her

Hear my songs in the club
Kasi is back at it
She says, ""You look like a star""
Oh, didn't you know that?
I know you don't get it
But what they tell you is true
You have to pay for this ass

Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow

His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)

No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot, feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
'Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long that
Even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how ya talkin' and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke, fool
I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the streetlight

We've been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We've been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise

Look at the situation they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the state
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watchin' got me chasin' dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
And my homies is down, so don't arouse my anger, fool
Death ain't nothin' but a heartbeat away
I'm livin' life do-or-die, what can I say?
I'm 23 now, but will I live to see 24?
The way things is goin', I don't know

We keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise

Power and the money, money and the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's runnin', but half of them ain't lookin'
It's goin' on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'
They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't, I guess they front
That's why I know my life is out of luck, fool

We've been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We've been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
'Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long that
Even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how ya talkin' and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke, fool
I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the streetlight

We've been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We've been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise

Look at the situation they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the state
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watchin' got me chasin' dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
And my homies is down, so don't arouse my anger, fool
Death ain't nothin' but a heartbeat away
I'm livin' life do-or-die, what can I say?
I'm 23 now, but will I live to see 24?
The way things is goin', I don't know

Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?

We've been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We've been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise

Power and the money, money and the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's runnin', but half of them ain't lookin'
It's goin' on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'
They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't, I guess they front
That's why I know my life is out of luck, fool

We've been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We've been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise

Astronaut

What you know about rollin' down in the deep?
When your brain goes numb, you can call that mental freeze
When these people talk too much, put that shit in slow motion, yeah
I feel like an astronaut in the ocean, ayy

She say that I'm cool (Damn straight)
I'm like, ""Yeah, that's true"" (That's true)
I believe in G-O-D (Ayy)
Don't believe in T-H-O-T
She keep playing me dumb (Play me)
I'ma play her for fun (Uh-huh)
Y'all don't really know my mental
Let me give you the picture like stencil
Fallin' out in a drought
No flow, rain wasn't pourin' down (Pourin' down)
See, that pain was all around
See, my mode was kinda lounged
Didn't know which, which way to turn
Flow was cool but I still felt burnt
Energy up, you can feel my surge
I'ma kill everything like this purge (Ayy)
You might also like
Let's just get this straight for a second, I'ma work (Yuh)
Even if I don't get paid for progression, I'ma get it (Uh, get it)
Everything that I do is electric (Ayy)
I'ma keep it in a motion, keep it movin' like kinetic, ayy (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Put this shit in a frame, better know I don't blame
Everything that I say, man, I seen you deflate
Let me elevate, this ain't a prank
Have you walkin' on a plank, li-li-li-li-like
Both hands together, God, let me pray (Now let me pray), uh
I've been goin' right, right around, call that relay (Masked Wolf)
Pass the baton, back and I'm on
Swimmin' in the pool, Kendrick Lamar, uh (Ayy)
Want a piece of this, a piece of mine, my peace a sign
Can you please read between the lines?
My rhyme's inclined to break your spine (Spine)
They say that I'm so fine (Fine)
You could never match my grind (True)
Please do not, not waste my time (Wolf)

Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my own life behind

While I was scheming for the masses

Now I'm smiling from the stage

I'm driving home for Christmas
Oh, I can't wait to see those faces
I'm driving home for Christmas, yeah
Well, I'm moving down that line

And it's been so long
But I will be there
I sing this song
To pass the time away
Driving in my car

Driving home for Christmas
It's gonna take some time but I'll get there

Top to toe in tailbacks
Oh, I got red lights all around
But soon there'll be a freeway, yeah
Get my feet on holy ground

Denn ich wär' heut so gern bei dir
Und ich glaub', ich fänd' es cool, wenn du mir gehörst

Yeah, baby, take my hand, I've already packed everything
Come on, let's both get out of here
Look, the jet's fueled, I've got money in the bank and plenty of seats here
And whenever you're lonely, I'll come around, you never have to be alone again
'Cause every time I see you, it makes me tick-tick-boom, like Dynamite

Aha, and all the other girls would like to be like you
Aha, because you're beautiful and dangerously smart
hey yo! And I hope that you see me
I'm in love and have no idea if you exist

But sometimes I only dream of you
Please tell me what do I have to do to make you hear me?
Because I would love to be with you today
And I think it would be cool if you were mine
I feel so alone, don't know if you exist
And no matter how loud I scream, she doesn't hear me
But she's somewhere right now and maybe she's thinking of me
Hey baby please write if you exist!

On the road every day and I see a lot of girls, but baby ey I can't find you
And there are so many girls who claim they are you, but I say, ""Hey, man, that's not true!""

Aha, and baby I wrote every song for you
Aha, but I'm alone because she doesn't see me
Aha, I hope it happens, I'm in love
But I have no idea if you exist

But sometimes I only dream of you
Please tell me what do I have to do to make you hear me?
Because I would love to be with you today
And I think it would be cool if you were mine
I feel so alone, don't know if you exist
And no matter how loud I scream, she doesn't hear me
But she's somewhere right now and maybe she's thinking of me
Hey baby please write if you exist!

Baby don't wait so long cause I don't like to be alone and every night I find my bed is too big
That's why I'd like to have you by my side, I can only think of you, man, I just can't let it go
And if you can hear me out there right now, please wait for me, I'm ready right away and I'll drive off
But if not, I'll go to bed alone and hope that I'll fall asleep again soon

Because sometimes I only dream of you
Please tell me what do I have to do to make you hear me?
Because I would love to be with you today
And I think it would be cool if you were mine

And he just smiled and gavе me a Vegemitе sandwich

If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy

Shining just the way I like

You met me at the perfect time

May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here...

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh!)
It's the return of the ""Oh, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said… nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Ha ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
""Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who,"" ""Yeah, but he's so cute though""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes—

Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!

""But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?""
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first

I'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: ""How can kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, 'cause at the rate, I'm going, when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here...

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh!)
It's the return of the ""Oh, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said… nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Ha ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
""Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who,"" ""Yeah, but he's so cute though""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes—

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (Nope)
Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn about a GRAMMY?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?""
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh!)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me

Spent my nights awake
And I wondered what I could have done

I will end up lost in confusion

Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that this story ends

Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

Now if we jump together, at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made

Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me

I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

For you, ich trag' tausend Tattoos auf der Haut

'Ne Totenkopf-Maske und 'n Sägeblatt
For you, alles voll und auch du hast 'n Platz
Damit ich nicht vergess', für wen ich's mach' (for you)

Wie alt ich bin? Digga, frag nicht
Ich mach' das hier langsam schon so lange wie mein Bart ist
War schon in den Tropen, in den Anden und der Arktis
Überall am Start, als gäb’ es irgendetwas gratis
Hin und wieder war ich dumm, nicht besonders artig
Aber sei mal ehrlich, dis war alles nicht dramatisch
Ich mein’, du kennst mich, wenn mich etwas stört, dann sag' ich’s
Doch ich sag' dir viel zu selten, „Schön, dass du da bist!“

Ich hab' 'ne Kassette aufm Arm
Was bedeutet, ich hab' meine alten Werte nicht verlor'n
Und weil mein Opa immer sagte, „Schreib dir das hinter die Löffel!“
Hab' ich heute diese Sterne hinterm Ohr
Alles, was ich gut finde, hab' ich tätowiert
Der Rest entzieht sich leider meinem Interesse
Und ja, ich gebe zu, manchmal kiffe ich zu viel
Was bedingt, dass ich so einiges vergesse
Darum schreib' ich's auf, mal in Schwarz, mal mit Farbe
Da, wo jetzt ein Herz ist, war mal 'ne Narbe
Und da steht dein Name, ich trag' ihn mit Stolz und das ist
Meine Art dir zu sagen, es ist schön, dass du da bist

For you
For you

For you, I wear a thousand tattoos on my skin
An astronaut and a saw blade
For you, everything is full and you stand on it too
So I don't forget who I'm doing it for
For you, ten thousand tattoos that I have
A skull mask and a saw blade
For you, everything is full and you have a place too
So that I don't forget who I'm doing it for (for you)

How old I am? Digga, don't ask
I've been doing this slowly for as long as my beard has been
Been to the tropics, the Andes and the Arctic
Everywhere at the start, as if there were something for free
At times I was stupid, not particularly well-behaved
But be honest, it wasn't all that dramatic
I mean, you know me, if something bothers me, then I'll say it
But I tell you far too seldom, ""Nice that you're here!""
You might also like
That's why I write it down, sometimes in black, sometimes in colour
Where there is a heart now, there used to be a scar
And there's your name, I wear it with pride and that's it
My way of saying it's nice that you're here

For you, I wear a thousand tattoos on my skin
An astronaut and a saw blade
For you, everything is full and you stand on it too
So that I don't forget who I'm doing it for
For you, ten thousand tattoos that I have
A skull mask and a saw blade
For you, everything is full and you have a place too
So that I don't forget who I'm doing it for (for you)

I have a cassette on my arm
Which means I haven't lost my old values
And because my grandfather always said, ""Write that behind your spoon!""
I have these stars behind my ears today
I have tattooed everything that I think is good
The rest unfortunately escapes my interest
And yes, I admit, sometimes I smoke weed too much
Which causes me to forget quite a few things
That's why I write it down, sometimes in black, sometimes in colour
Where there's a heart now, there used to be a scar
And there's your name, I wear it with pride and that's it
My way of saying it's nice that you're here

For you, I wear a thousand tattoos on my skin
An astronaut and a saw blade
For you, everything is full and you stand on it too
So that I don't forget who I'm doing it for
For you, ten thousand tattoos that I have
A skull mask and a saw blade
For you, everything is full and you have a place too
So that I don't forget who I'm doing it for (for you)

I was at the bottom and at the top
I drowned and flew
Have a souvenir from anywhere
Even if the tide turns again
And that all ends once
I say, ""The main thing is that you're here!"" (for you)
I was at the bottom and at the top
I drowned and flew
Have a souvenir from anywhere
Even if the tide turns again
And that all ends once
I say, ""The main thing is that you are here!""
I'll do it all for you
I wear a thousand tattoos on my skin
An astronaut and a saw blade
For you, everything is full and you stand on it too
So that I don't forget who I'm doing it for
For you, ten thousand tattoos that I have
A skull mask and a saw blade
For you, everything is full and you have a place too
So that I don't forget who I'm doing it for (for you)

Es tut mir leid, mein Leben dreht sich nur um Cannabis
Und für Stress hab' ich so 'n paar Banana Clips wie 'n Salafist (Scheiße), heh
Und während du so wie ein Penner lebst
Siehst du mich im AMG auf dreiteiligen MAEs
Uff, ya salame, die Straße hat mich lieb (Uff)
Fahr' über Rot nur aus Prinzip, bis zum Tod bleib' ich Bandit (Ja, ja)
Der Code ist 187, Bruder, Sonus macht den Beat (Sonus)

I don't know what you've been told
But time is running out, no need to take it slow
I'm stepping to you toe-to-toe
I should be scared, honey, maybe so

But I ain't worried 'bout it right now (Right now)
Keeping dreams alive, 1999, heroes
I ain't worried 'bout it right now (Right now)
Swimmin' in the floods, dancing on the clouds below

I ain't worried 'bout it
I ain't worried 'bout it (Hey)

I don't know what you've been told
But time is running out so spend it like it's gold
I'm living like I'm nine-zeros
Got no regrets even when I am broke (Yeah)
I'm at my best when I got something I'm wanting to steal
Way too busy for them problems and problems to feel (Yeah, yeah)
No stressing, just obsessing with sealing the deal
I'll take it in and let it go

Ich sitz' schon wieder in mei'm Wohnzimmer
Ich schreib' ein Lied für dich und du verdienst es wieder nicht
Nur dass ich's gleich sag: Es war echt einfach
War deine Nummer eins und ich wollt' nur, dass du bleibst
Erinnerst du dich an den Schweighöfer-Film?
Den haben wir zwei nie zu Ende geseh'n
Erinnerst du dich an den Trip nach Berlin?
Am Ende bist du dann alleine hin

Ich heb' nicht ab, wenn du mich anrufst in der Nacht
Schreib' nicht zurück, wenn du mich fragst, was ich mach'
Ich hör' nicht hin, wenn du von Tinder-Matches sprichst
Ich hoff', du hörst den Song, wenn du im Bett bei deiner Nächsten liegst
Man sieht sich immer zweimal
Und mir wär lieber keinmal, keinmal mehr
Man sieht sich immer zweimal, zweimal
Probier'n wir bitte keinmal, keinmal mehr

Wir ging'n auseinander und dann kam ein andrer
Ich ließ ihn alleine stehen, um dann zu dir zu geh'n
Und ich lösch' grad alle deine Bilder
Und die Erinnerung mit, Freunde bleiben wir nicht
Denk doch mal schnell an den Text von Poisel
Wollt' dir damit sagen, was ich von dir will
Was denkst du, was jetzt meine Mum von dir hält?

I'm sitting in my living room again
I'll write a song for you and you don't deserve it again
Just to say it right away: It was really easy
Was your number one and I just wanted you to stay
Do you remember the Schweighöfer film?
We two never saw the end of it
Do you remember the trip to Berlin?
In the end you are alone

I don't answer if you call me at night
Don't write back if you ask me what I'm doing
I don't listen when you talk about Tinder matches
I hope you hear the song when you lie in bed with your loved one
You always meet twice
And I'd rather not, not even more
You always see each other twice, twice
Let's not try it, please, never again

We broke up and then someone else came along
I left him alone to then go to you
And I'm deleting all your pictures right now

Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me

So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know ﻿I was lost


I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
I hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game﻿ made for everyone
And love is the prize

Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget

Und Babe, ich weiß, dass es passt
Zwischen uns hat's gefunkt beim ersten Mal
Auch wenn's keiner versteht
Du hast mein'n Kopf verdreht
Deine Art, wie du tanzt, im Gucci-Kleid

Und wir sind frei, nur du und ich
Ganz alle-e-ein, -llein

Cherry, cherry lady, du bist was Besondres
Eine Frau fürs Leben oder für 'ne Nacht

Und wir sind frei, nur du und ich

If all of the kings had their queens on the throne

Baby, you're not dancing on your own

Can't live without me, you wanna, but you can't, nah-nah-nah
Think it's funny, but honey, can't run this show on your own
I can feel my body shake, there's only so much I can take
I'll show you how a real queen behaves (Oh)

No damsel in distress, don't need to save me
Once I start breathin' fire, you can't tame me
And you might think I'm weak without a sword
But if I had one, it'd be bigger than yours

If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would pop champagne and raise a toast

Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So before you go

Was never the right time whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face
You might also like
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal, but this won't

So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'da known you had a storm to weather
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So before you go

Would we be better off by now
If I'da let my walls come down?
Maybe, I guess we'll never know
You know, you know

Before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'da known you had a storm to weather
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless

(Juh-Juh-Dee on the beat)
(Young Mesh macht die 808)

Wir rollen nachts, der Himmel schimmert bläulich
Apache bleibt gleich, aber heut nicht
Sie sagt mir, sie findet mich so freundlich
Sonst wär sie nicht da, denn sie ist nicht käuflich
Tret' dezent das Gaspedal und sie freut sich
Klatsch' 21 Zoll an meinen Benz dran 
Fahren durch die Stadt, offenes Fenster
Im Backstage wimmelt es nur so von Gangstern
Der DJ spielt uns „Rhythm Is a Dancer“

Polizeikontrolle, Officer, du täuschst dich
Der Wagen ist ab Werk so laut, du träumst nicht
AMG-Emblem, es steht da deutlich
Schau in die Papiere, überzeug dich
Rap-Battles auf Parkdächern, Apache zerstört
Je nach Beat wechselt Farbe des Interieurs
Bitches schauen uns zu, sie hab'n davon gehört
Bin voll besoffen, Brudi, ich bin voll auf Turn
30k an mei'm Arm, während ich Jägi-Cola trink'
So lange nachgedacht, „Soll ich sie kaufen oder nicht?“
Auch wenn das eigentlich ganz klar gegen mein'n Kodex ist
Anders verschaffst du dir keinen Respekt bei dieser Oberschicht

Rapper zittern, wenn Apache einmal Trap macht
Schöne Frau neben mir, eine Hand am Lenkrad
Sie sagt, „Lieb mich auch“, Baby, ich glaube fest dran
Hör doch auf damit, ich weiß, du machst das extra
Dein Ex verspricht dir Sachen, ich weiß, dass der Typ lügt
Zu sexy Karre, die soll'n aus dem Weg geh'n, tüt-tüt
Lass ins Hotelzimmer, da sind Pflanzen, die grün blüh'n
Lass dein'n Wecker aus, denn wir werden geweckt vom Frühstück

Überteuerte Suite, was für 'ne Frechheit
Sollte doch eigentlich gar nicht mit ihr im Bett sein
Bring mich nach Haus
Wir rollen nachts, der Himmel schimmert bläulich

(Juh-Juh-Dee on the beat)
(Young Mesh makes the 808)

We roll at night, the sky shimmers bluish
Apache stays the same, but not today
She tells me she thinks I'm so friendly
Otherwise it wouldn't be there, because it can't be bought
Kick the gas pedal discreetly and she'll be happy
Slap 21 inches on my Benz
Driving through the city, open window
The backstage is teeming with gangsters
The DJ plays us ""Rhythm Is a Dancer""

Police check, officer, you're wrong
The car is so loud from the factory, you're not dreaming
AMG emblem, it says it clearly
Look at the papers, convince yourself
Rap battles on parking decks, Apache destroyed
The color of the interior changes depending on the beat
Bitches watch us, they heard about it
I'm totally drunk, bro, I'm really on the turn
30k on my arm while I drink Jägi-Cola
Thinking for so long, ""Should I buy them or not?""
Even if that's actually quite clearly against my code
Otherwise you won't get respect from this upper class

Rappers tremble when Apache makes a trap once
Beautiful woman next to me, one hand on the wheel
She says, ""Love me too"", baby, I really believe it
Stop it, I know you're doing this extra
Your ex promises you things, I know the guy is lying
Too sexy car, they should get out of the way, do-do
Let into the hotel room, there are plants that are blooming green
Leave your alarm clock off, because we'll be woken up by breakfast

Overpriced suite, what a cheek
Shouldn't even be in bed with her
Take me home
We roll at night, the sky shimmers bluish
Apache stays the same, but not today
She tells me she thinks I'm so kind
Otherwise it wouldn't be there, because it can't be bought

Ich haue rein, meine Mama ist am wein'n
Denn sie holt uns alles, doch sich selbst holt sie ein'n Scheiß

Deshalb seid ihr Pisser nicht auf meinem Radar

Mother says no, she's not hungry
My fries are reflected in her beautiful wet eyes
I'll hit it, my mom is crying
Because she gets us everything, but she gets a shit for herself
I was way too small to take a bearing, I'm sorry
No more sorrow, no more strife, I'll soon be the one
The vodka goes ka-boom in my kafa
That's why you fuckers aren't on my radar
I'm a little hungover, watch the way you talk
From today I have a song with Sido Baba
I don't give a fuck, most people talk about borders
Kripo tick from quantities kilos, but
Deal a tenner, every day they gamble with greasy hair in Spielos afterwards
Criminal railway was once (was once)
Came home, nobody was there (was there)
I will regret nada
Because the state was never my father (No)
You're Clyde, I'm Bonnie
She says, ""You're Pablo, baby, I'm Tata""
And that's not a feature, I don't make features
Just fulfill the dream I had as a child

2002, I'm sitting in the train and traveling without a ticket
From the MV to Schöneberg to the studio
Fed up, because the pockets are empty
Grass in the blood, hate in the heart
Yes, my friend, life is a son of a bitch
The police are ringing at home again
They ask where I am and Mama says she doesn't know
But where should I be? I'm wasting my time
Five people, two kebabs, at one in the morning
I knew: either my album will go off
Or I'll be in jail soon
Either I'll get my hook soon
Or I'll kill you all
If nothing changes, the drugs won't help either
But today you can't imagine what it would be like without me
I'm the father of this rap thing
It flows in my system
Ask the juice and the backspin
I saw many come and go
And today I'm driving around with Apache
Bacardi Rum in the cup
This hip hop is my life
If you ask why I'm doing this
The sun is shining, the cell phone rings, Siggi calls

Hahaha, alright
Alright, okay
Uh, alright, okay

Return of the Mack
Get 'em; what it is? What it does? What it is? What it isn't?
Looking for a better way to get up outta bed
Instead of getting on the Internet
And checking on who hit me, get up
Thrift shop, pimp-strut walkin'
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Sweater game, nope, nope, y'all can't copy, yeah
Bad, moonwalking, this here is our party
My posse's been on Broadway, and we did it our way
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones
Into everything I record to it and yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit, hustlin'
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen
With the four-track, bussin'
Halfway 'cross that city with the back (Back) pack (Pack), fat (Fat) cat (Cat), crushin'

Mit Straßenschuh'n im Gym
Gestrecktes Kokain
Mit Speed und Aspirin
Ganzen Tag auf der Treppe vorm Ritz
Eine Zigarette zu dritt
Weil Fünfhaus ist Madrid, ey (Ahh)

Mit Minirock und Top, doch wir hab'n Hunger wie ein Tiger (Ahh)

I know you moved onto someone new
Hope life is beautiful
You were the light for me to find my truth
I just wanna say, thank you

Leaving to find my soul
Told her I had to go
And I know it ain't pretty
When our hearts get broke
Too young to feel this old
Watching us both turn cold
Oh, I know it ain't pretty
When two hearts get broke
Yeah, I know it ain't pretty
When two hearts get broke

I hope someday we'll sit down together
And laugh with each other about these days, these days
All our troubles, we'll lay to rest and
We'll wish we could come back to these days, these days

Oh, I know, I know

And I know it ain't pretty when the fire burns out
Calling me when I'm drunk, remind me of what I've done
And I know it ain't pretty when you're trying to move on, yeah

I hope someday we'll sit down together
And laugh with each other about these days, these days
All our troubles, we'll lay to rest and
We'll wish we could come back to these days, these days

To these days, these days, oh

Cigarettes in the ashtray
Reminiscing on those past days
I thought you’d end up with my last name
But that changed
And I travelled around the world
Think where you living at now?
I heard you moved to Austin
Got an apartment and settled down
And every once in a while, I start texting
Write a paragraph, but then I delete the message
Think about you like a past time
I could cry you a river, get you baptized or
I wasn't ready to act right
Used to always think I'd get you back, right
They say that things fall apart
We were gonna move to Brooklyn
You were gonna study art
Love is just a tool
To remind us who we are
And that we are not alone
When we're walking in the dark
I hope someday we'll sit down together
And laugh with each other about these days, these days
All our troubles, we'll lay to rest and
We'll wish we could come back to these days, these days

I know you moved onto someone new
Hope life is beautiful
You were the light for me to find my truth
I just wanna say, thank you

Leaving to find my soul
Told her I had to go
And I know it ain't pretty
When our hearts get broke
Too young to feel this old
Watching us both turn cold
Oh, I know it ain't pretty
When two hearts get broke
Yeah, I know it ain't pretty
When two hearts get broke

I hope someday we'll sit down together
And laugh with each other about these days, these days

Told 'em wipe a nigga nose, say slatt, slatt
I won't never sell my soul, and I can back that

Cruise the city in a bulletproof Cadillac (Skrrt)

Nigga try to get me for my water
I'll lay his ass down, on my son, on my daughter

Lotta niggas out here playin', ain't ballin'

Hearin' whispers in the night
Voices fillin' up your mind
You're like a ghost of you
You've been drownin' in the rain
Slowly savin' up the pain
So deep inside of you

See the colors of the sky
Slowly turn from black and white
A rising hope, bright as gold
Now there's nothing left to lose
So we're breakin' all the rules
And they don't know what we know

'Cause I can hear
The thunder from afar
A lightning in the dark
I can feel a fire come alive

Seh' ich keine Blocks, hab' ich Heimweh
Ich brauch’ den Dschungel, so wie Mogli
So viele Leichen war'n auf mei'm Weg
Blut an den Schuhen von Cerruti
Sie woll'n mich ficken auf dem 3g
Wenn eine Single wieder Eins geht
Baby, das auf Insta ist nicht dein Face
Wenn wir uns treffen, wird's 'n Blind Date (Ah-ah)
Krieg im Kopf wie Okinawa
Bisschen Wodka, Tropicana

Vier, fünf Frau'n, bin Polygamer

Africa-Trap à la Kofi Annan
Man hört mich im Balkan, neuf-trois, Paname
Insha bald Korea, Japan (Ahh)

Mann, viele kamen und ging'n, so wie der Sand am Meer

I can't turn my head off
Wishing these memories would fade, they never do
Turns out people lie
They said, ""Just snap your fingers""
As if it was really that easy for me to get over you

I just need time

Snappin' one, two
Where are you?
You're still in my heart
Snappin' three, four
Don't need you here anymore
Get out of my heart
'Cause I might snap

I'm writin' a song
Said, ""This is the last one""
How many last songs are left? I'm losing count
Since June 22nd
My heart's been on fire
I've been spendin' my nights in the rain tryin' to put it out

So I'm snappin' one, two
Where are you?
You're still in my heart
Snappin' three, four
Don't need you here anymore
Get out of my heart
'Cause I might snap

Oh-woah
'Cause I might snap
Oh-woah

And if one more person says, ""You should get over it""
Oh, I might stop talkin' to people before I snap, snap, snap
Oh, I might stop talkin' to people before I snap

Snappin' one, two
Where are you? (Where are you?)
You're still in my heart (Still in my heart)
Snappin' three, four
Don't need you here anymore (Need you here anymore)
Get out of my heart

Du willst keine Liebe, denn du bist Material
Du weißt, jeder Mann, der was auf sich hält, schaut dich an

Denn du tanzt wie Madonna

It may be
That the other girls slowly understand how it works
It may be
That the other girls also know how to move
But you are different, you are different
You have this aura, just like back then
You don't want love because you are material
You know every self-respecting man looks at you

Because you dance like Madonna

Soulless men are in love, Madonna
My heart was stolen, you're the thief, Madonna

Everyone is going crazy because you're like Madonna

Soulless men are in love, Madonna
My heart was stolen, you're the thief, Madonna, ah, ah-ah-ah

Life can also be simple
Such pretty women, no matter where you look
Dear God, why are you sending them to me?

It starts with one
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time, all I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, d-didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go

I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

But in the end, it doesn't even matter

I'm searchin' to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world that was smilin' when I turned

Tell you you're the greatest

And the laughter in thе halls and the names that I've been called
I stack it in my mind, and I'm waitin' for the time
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic

I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground
I'm searchin' to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world that was smilin' when I turned

Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us

Oh, the misery

And the laughter in thе halls and the names that I've been called
I stack it in my mind, and I'm waitin' for the time
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic

Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew ya

She broke your throne and she cut your hair

You said you hated the ocean, but you're surfin' now
I said I'd love you for life, but I just sold our house
We were kids at the start, I guess we're grown-ups now, mmm

But not everything works out, no

Now I'm out dancin' with strangers
You could be casually datin'
Damn, it's all changin' so fast

Oh, darlin', just dive right in and follow my lead

But, darlin', just kiss me slow

And in your eyes, you're holdin' mine

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darlin', you look perfect tonight

Well, I found a woman stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that, someday, I'll share her home

Für euch war nach mei'm ersten Wort Schluss
An der Spitze ist es einsam
Sie zahl'n den Benz von ihrem Vorschuss
Ich zahl' den Benz von meinen Einnahm'n
Wir feiern hart, zerficken Shows
Und wir lieben Risiko
Nach 22 Jahr'n hab' ich verstanden
Mein Vater wollt nicht nur kurz Kippen hol'n
Es wird langsam wieder Abend
Leg' meine kleine Schwester schlafen
Ich treibe mich rum auf der Straße
Ab und zu bricht mal 'ne Nase
Nicht aus Zucker, doch die Nächte sind kalt
Liebe ruft an, ich hab' keinen Empfang
Handy vibriert in der Hand
Kann es nicht lesen, bin wieder auf Alk

Wenn die ersten Strahlen morgens durch dein Fenster schießen
Und deine Nase kitzeln, musst du halb im Schlaf noch niesen
Sind unsre Blöcke viel zu hoch, wir könn'n es nicht genießen
Nicht mal die Sonne schafft es hier rein (La la la la la la la)

Ich hasse Gewalt
Doch manchmal muss man sie zum Spur'n bringen
Und sieht man sich mal live
Müssen sie sich durch ihre Hose auf die Schuhe pissen
Ich spiele 'ne Show in einer Arena
Du spielst in Kneipen, also Ruhe bitte
Alle Karten weg in zehn Minuten
Bitches bieten Sex an für Tourtickets
Die Rapszene ist nur ein Affenzirkus
In dem kleine Kinder gern mit Waffen hantier'n
Ich steh', wo ich steh', weil ich bin, wer ich bin
Und nicht weil hier irgendjemand Apache platziert
Ich weiß es doch selbst, ich war lange weg
Doch auch wenn ich mal ein Kinderlied droppe (La la la la la la la)
Besser verpiss dich aus meiner Relea— (Apache, la la la la)

hey

For you it was over after my first word
It's lonely at the top
You pay the Benz from your advance
I pay the Benz from my earnings
We party hard, fuck up shows
And we love risk
After 22 years I understood
My father didn't just want to fetch cigarettes
It's getting late in the evening
Put my little sister to sleep
I roam the streets
Every now and then a nose breaks
Not made of sugar, but the nights are cold
Love is calling, I have no reception
Cell phone vibrates in hand
Can't read it, back on alcohol

When the first rays shoot through your window in the morning
And tickle your nose, you still have to sneeze halfway asleep
If our blocks are too high, we can't enjoy it
Even the sun can't get in here (La la la la la la la)

But sometimes you have to bring them to Spur'n
And see you live
Do they have to piss on their shoes through their pants?

You're playing in bars, so quiet please
All cards gone in ten minutes
Bitches offer sex for tour tickets
The rap scene is just a monkey circus
In which small children like to handle weapons
I stand where I stand because I am who I am
And not because someone puts Apache here
I know it myself, I've been away for a long time
But even if I drop a children's song (La la la la la la la)
Better get the hell out of my release— (Apache, la la la la)

I come alive in the fall time, I
The competition, I don't really listen
I'm in the blue Mulsanne, bumpin' New Edition
House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table, cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby, ah
You talkin' money, need a hearin' aid
You talkin' 'bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain

I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
Let a nigga brag Pitt
Legend of the fall, took the year like a bandit
Bought Mama a crib and a brand new wagon
Now she hit the grocery shop lookin' lavish
Star Trek roof in that Wraith of Khan
Girls get loose when they hear this song
A hundred on the dash get me close to God
We don't pray for love, we just pray for cars
House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table, cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby, ah
You talkin' money, need a hearin' aid
You talkin' 'bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain

Uh
Yeah, yeah

When I was young, I fell in love
We used to hold hands, man, that was enough (Yeah)
Then we grew up, started to touch
Used to kiss underneath the light on the back of the bus (Yeah)
I know your daddy didn't like me much
And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one
Oh, every day, she found a way out of the window to sneak out late

She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know that we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah

We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me
You might also like
Seventeen, and we got a dream to have a family
A house, and everything in between
And then, oh, suddenly, we turned twenty-three
And now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously
We got our dead-end jobs and got bills to pay
Our old friends are now our enemies
And now I, I'm thinking back to when I was young
Back to the day when I was falling in love

He used to meet me on the Eastside

It's Christmas time
There's no need to be afraid
At Christmas time
We let in light and we banish shade

And in our world of plenty
We can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world
At Christmas time

But say a prayer
Pray for the other ones
At Christmas time it's hard
But when you're having fun

There's a world outside your window
And it's a world of dread and fear

Where the only water flowing
Is the bitter sting of tears
You might also like
And the Christmas bells that ring there
Are the clanging chimes of doom

Well tonight thank God it's them
Instead of you

And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmas time
The greatest gift they'll get this year is life (Oooh)
Where nothing ever grows, no rain or rivers flow
Do they know it's Christmas time at all?

Here's to you

Raise a glass for everyone

Here's to them

Underneath that burning sun
Do they know it's Christmas time at all?

Porque cuando arrancamos ya no para el tren, еh

And take a chance with me (Ba-da, ba-da)

Y si mezclamos mi cerveza y tu tequila
Hoy no hay controles de Berlín hasta Manila
Ay, tu sonrisa me parece poesía, yeah
¿Cómo te digo? ¿Cómo te digo yo?

Why don't we live? Why don't we live?
Why don't we live just a little bit?
Why don't we stay? Why don't we stay?
Why don't we (Uh)

Wake up in Manila, ride to Belize
Dive into the ocean and feel a little free
Skies of vanilla, smell it through the breeze
You could be the one, take a chance with me
Take a chance with me

Wake up in Manila, ride to Belize
Dive into the ocean and feel a little free
Skies of vanilla, smell it through the breeze
You could be the one, take a chance with me

You're runnin' circles 'round your heart (Oh, yeah)
I know it's goin' to be real dark (Oh, yeah)
I take a minute, light a spark (Oh, yeah)
We can dance until the fall
Si te vienes conmigo piénsatelo bien
Vamos a cien por hora, un poco del revés
Porque cuando arrancamos ya no para el tren, еh
Mira que te lo cuento biеn, ieh-eh

Why don't we live? Why don't we live?
Why don't we live just a little bit?
Why don't we stay? Why don't we stay?
Why don't we

Wake up in Manila, ride to Belize
Dive into the ocean and feel a little free
Skies of vanilla, smell it through the breeze

I found a love for me
Oh, darlin', just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me

'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But, darlin', just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holdin' mine

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darlin', you look perfect tonight

Well, I found a woman stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that, someday, I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
You might also like
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fightin' against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darlin', just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress, lookin' so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darlin', you look perfect tonight

No, no, no
Mm, no, no

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
We're barefoot on the grass, oh, listenin' to our favourite song
I have faith in what I see, now I know I have met
An angel in person and she looks perfect
I don't deserve this, you look perfect tonight265Embed","325 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçeEspañolPortuguêsItalianoΕλληνικάDeutschFrançaisفارسیPerfect Lyrics
