I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
You might also like
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around

For now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug

I met you in the dark, you lit me up
You made me feel as though I was enough
We danced the night away, we drank too much
I held your hair back when you were throwin' up

Then, you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, ""I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest""

I knew I loved you then, but you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you, but I never showed
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school, wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night
You might also like
When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, woah
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that every day, you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you and I hope you know
Darlin', your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far, my dear, look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me when I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till my lungs give out
I promise till death we part, like in our vows
So, I wrote this song for you, now everybody knows
That it's just you and me till we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I found a love for me
Oh, darlin', just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me

'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But, darlin', just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holdin' mine

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darlin', you look perfect tonight

Well, I found a woman stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that, someday, I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fightin' against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darlin', just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress, lookin' so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darlin', you look perfect tonight

No, no, no
Mm, no, no

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms

Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer till our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

So you can keep me

And if you hurt me, well, that's okay, baby
Only words bleed inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home

Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Oh, you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were 16
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me, well, that's okay, baby
Only words bleed inside these pages
You just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on 6th Street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
""Wait for me to come home""275Embed","159 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsΕλληνικάPhotograph Lyrics

I still remember, third of December, me in your sweater
You said it looked better on me than it did you
Only if you knew, how much I liked you
But I watch your eyes as she

Walks by
What a sight for sore eyes, brighter than a blue sky
She's got you mesmerized while I die

Why would you ever kiss me?
I'm not even half as pretty
You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester
But you like her better
(Wish I were Heather)

Watch as she stands with her, holding your hand
Put your arm 'round her shoulder, now I'm getting colder
But how could I hate her? She's such an angel
But then again, kinda wish she were dead as she

But it's so good, I've never known anybody like you
But it's so good, I've never dreamed of nobody like you

And I've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime
And I'm pretty sure that you are that love of mine

Wishin' on every one that you'd be mine, mine
And I see forever in your eyes
I feel okay when I see you smile, smile

Wishin' on dandelions all of the time
Prayin' to God that one day you'll be mine

Now my heart feel like December when somebody say your name

Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts someday, ayy-ayy

I could say I never dare
To think about you in that way
But, I would be lying
And I pretend I'm happy for you
When you find some dude to take home
But I won't deny that

In the midst of the crowds
In the shapes, in the clouds
I don't see nobody but you
In my rose-tinted dreams
Wrinkled silk on my sheets
I don't see nobody but you

Boy, you got me hooked onto something
Who could say that they saw us coming?
Tell me, do you feel the love?
Spend a summer or a lifetime with me
Let me take you to the place of your dreams
Tell me, do you feel the love?

Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here

Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear

Isn't it lovely, all alone?

Tear me to pieces, skin to bone

I fell by the wayside like everyone else
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, but I was just kidding myself

'Cause now that they're gone, all I hear are the words that I needed to say

When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal, but this won't

So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'da known you had a storm to weather
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So before you go

Was never the right time whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face

That's why when the sun's up, I'm stayin'
Still layin' in your bed, singin'

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Got all this time on our hands
Might as well cancel our plans, yeah
I could stay here for a lifetime

So, lock the door and throw out the key
Can't fight this no more, it's just you and me
And there's nothin' I, nothin' I, I can do
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
So, go ahead and drive me insane
Baby, run your mouth, I still wouldn't change
Being stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you, baby

There's nowhere we need to be, no, no, no
I'ma get to know you better
Kinda hope we're here forever
There's nobody on these streets
If you told me that the world's endin'
Ain't no other way that I can spend it

Oh, oh, oh, oh (Ooh)
Got all this time in my hands
Might as well cancel our plans (Yeah, yeah)
I could stay here forever

So, lock the door and throw out the key
Can't fight this no more, it's just you and me

Baby, run your mouth, I still wouldn't trade
Being stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you

Woah
Baby, come take all my time
Go on, make me lose my mind
We got all that we need here tonight
I lock the door (Lock the door) and throw out the key
Can't fight this no more (Can't fight this no more), it's just you and me
And there's nothin' I, nothin' I'd rather do
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
So, go ahead and drive me insane

You must think that I'm stupid
You must think that I'm a fool
You must think that I'm new to this
But I have seen this all before

I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
I'm way too good at goodbyes

Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much
And that's an issue, but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends
It was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no calls
Now you're lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover

Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner

From your roommate back in Boulder

Why you walk out my life?

I get like this every time
On these days that feel like you and me

Balloons are deflated
Guess they look lifeless like me
We miss you on your side of the bed, mmm
Still got your things here
And they stare at me like souvenirs

Said that you love me, but that'll last for never

Saat hatimu terluka
Akulah yang menemanimu
Membasuh air matamu

Namun mengapa ketika
Hatimu telah tersenyum lagi
Aku yang kau lupa

Tak sadarkah selama ini
'Ku juga selalu menginginkanmu

Mengapa sulit untuk kubisa miliki hatimu
Bahkan selama ini hadirku tak berharga untukmu
Yang terjadi kini 'ku hanya rumah persinggahanmu
Di saat kau terluka
Dan di saat semuanya reda
Kau menghilang begitu saja

Jika memang ini tak ada harapan
Mengapa aku yang harus jadi tujuan
Saat hatimu terluka
Aku yang jadi obatnya
Tanpa pernah kau hargai
Cinta dan kasih yang setulus ini

When your heart hurts
I'm the one who accompanies you
Wash your tears

But why when
Your heart has smiled again
I'm the one you forgot

Wasn't aware all this time
'I've always wanted you too

Why is it hard for me to have your heart
Even all this time my presence is worthless to you
What's happening now is that I'm just your halfway house
When you're hurt
And when it all subsides
You just disappeared

If indeed this is hopeless
Why should I be the goal
When your heart hurts
I'm the medicine
You never appreciate
This sincere love and affection

That I was the only girl you'd ever want in your life

You gave me your word, ""Don't worry 'bout her""

I look up from the ground
To see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me
And I see there's something you're trying to hide
And I reach for your hand but it's cold
You pull away again
And I wonder what's on your mind
And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble and your voice begins to break
You say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's
They were my mate's
And I feel the colour draining from my face

And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be alright""

So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent
And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head
And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone
And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on
But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
But I just wanna stay

Und hat sie geile Titten dann:

Wenn sie geil ist, dann wird sie von uns genagelt bis sie kommt
Ganz egal, ob sie jung ist oder alt
Wenn sie geil ist, dann wird sie von uns im Bungalow geknallt

Sexy Babe namens Anna auf den Cayman Islands
Ich bin auf dem Weg nach Havanna, willst du eh mit auf Segelreise
Komm, wir cruisen durch den Panama-Kanal
Und essen Ananas mit Sahne, ich spritz Anna nass mit Sahne
Ich hab die Bitch in Paris auf dem Eiffelturm gebangt
Du bist eifersüchtig, denn du hast leider keine Fans
Du hast keine kleinen Groupies, die dir Liebesbriefe schreiben
Und dich bitten: ""Kannst du mal auf dem Bikini unterschreiben""
Und ich sagte zu der Bitch ohne Waffengelaber
„Wenn du mit mir bist, kaufe ich dir ständig Sachen von Prada“
Und wenn ich sage, dass du jetzt von mir 'ne Latte kriegst
Red' ich nicht von braunen Getränken oder von Zaunelementen
Sie hat den Dick in St. Tropez gelutscht
Bei Kentucky Fried Chicken in L.A. gelutscht
Mitten in der Neighbourhood
Ich fick mit Bitches auf Jamaika in 'ner Schilfhütte
Zwei schwarze Babes und ich Homie - Milchschnitte

Und die Brötchen in der Früh ja sie warn kross
Get it? Sie hat gefickt mit 'nem Rapper
Und am nächsten Tag da nahm sie mir was mit von 'nem Bäcker
Und im Radio läuft DJ Antoine
Wir sind wieder mal in Cannes in diesem Kino da am Strand
Ich kauf' mir Sakkos aus Samt und riech nach Paco Rabanne

Oder schöne Dinge, so wie geile Weiber oder Geld
Sowie Kleider von Chanel, Kaschmir, Seide oder Pelz
Ich cock Hater weg und mache eine Reise um die Welt

Cock the bitch away

Bitches get cocked
And does she have great tits then:

Sexy babe named Anna in the Cayman Islands
I'm on my way to Havana, do you want to go sailing with me anyway?
Come on, let's cruise the Panama Canal
And eat pineapple with cream, I splash Anna wet with cream
I banged that bitch in Paris on the Eiffel Tower
You're jealous because unfortunately you don't have any fans
You don't have little groupies writing you love letters
And ask you: ""Could you sign the bikini?""
And I said no gun talk to the bitch
""When you're with me, I'll buy you Prada stuff all the time""
And if I say I'll give you a latte now
I don't talk about brown drinks or fence elements
She sucked the dick in St Tropez
Sucked at Kentucky Fried Chicken in L.A
In the middle of the neighborhood
I fuck with bitches in Jamaica in a reed hut
Two black babes and me homie - milk cut

And the rolls in the morning, yes, they were crispy
Get it? She fucked with a rapper
And the next day she took me something from a baker
And DJ Antoine is playing on the radio
We are again in Cannes in this cinema on the beach
I buy velvet jackets and smell like Paco Rabanne
Order macchiatos in Cannes and eat a taco on the beach
And whoever hates me actually hates himself
Or beautiful things, like horny women or money
As well as dresses from Chanel, cashmere, silk or fur
I cock haters away and take a trip around the world

A club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go (Mm)
Me and my friends at the table doin' shots
Drinkin' fast and then we talk slow (Mm)
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I'll give it a chance now (Mm)
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance and now I'm singin' like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, ""Boy, let's not talk too much""
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is fallin' too
I'm in love with your body
And last night, you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
Well, I'm in love with your body

One week in, we let the story begin
We're goin' out on our first date (Mm)
You and me are thrifty, so go all-you-can-eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate (Mm)
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doin' okay (Mm)
And leave and get in a taxi, and kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play and I'm singin' like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead

Brown guilty eyes and
Little white lies, yeah
I played dumb, but I always knew
That you talked to her, maybe did even worse
I kept quiet so I could keep you

And ain't it funny how you ran to her

And ain't it funny how you said you were friends?
Now it sure as hell don't look like it

You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry

It took you two weeks to go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still a traitor

Show her off like she's a new trophy
And I know if you were true, there's no damn way that you
Could fall in love with somebody that quickly

All the questions you used to avoid
Ain't it funny? Remember I brought her up
And you told me I was paranoid?

Rolling on like a Rolling Stone
Sing-song when I'm walkin' home
Jump up to the top, LeBron
Ding-dong, call me on my phone
Ice tea and a game of ping pong

This is gettin' heavy, can you hear the bass boom? I'm ready (Woo-hoo)

You broke me first

Maybe you don't like talking too much about yourself
But you shoulda told me that you were thinking 'bout someone else
You're drunk at a party or maybe it's just that your car broke down
Your phone's been off for a couple of months, so you're calling me now
I know you, you're like this
When shit don't go your way, you needed me to fix it
And like me, I did
But I ran out of every reason

Now suddenly, you're asking for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first
You broke me first

Took a while, was in denial when I first heard
That you moved on quicker than I could've ever, you know that hurt
Swear for a while, I would stare at my phone just to see your name
But now that it's there, I don't really know what to say

Through the floor to the basement
I'm going to grab the hem of my clothes

For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness' sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well, I ain't

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two
And tradin' jackets
Laughin’ 'bout how small it looks on you
(Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha)
Watching reruns of Glee
Bein' annoying, singin’ in harmony
I bet she's braggin' to all her friends, sayin' you're so unique, hmm

So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she’s with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Ah) Hmm
Do you get déjà vu, huh?

Do you call her, almost say my name?
’Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
Another actress
I hate to think that I was just your type
And I bet that she knows Billy Joel
’Cause you played her ""Uptown Girl""
You're singin' it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her

Giving me love when you are down and need another

But I love you so (Ooh-ooh-ooh)

This feeling's old and I know that I've made up my mind
I hope you feel what I felt when you shattered my soul
'Cause you were cruel and I'm a fool, so please, let me go

I just need someone in my life to give it structure
To handle all the selfish ways I'd spend my time without her
You're everything I want but I can't deal with all your lovers
You're saying I'm the one, but it's your actions that speak louder
Giving me love when you are down and need another
I've got to get away and let you go, I've got to get over

But I love you so (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I love you so (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I love you so (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I love you so

I'm gonna pack my things and leave you behind
This feeling's old and I know that I've made up my mind
I hope you feel what I felt when you shattered my soul
'Cause you were cruel and I'm a fool, so please, let me go

But I love you so (Please, let me go)
I love you so (Please, let me go)
I love you so (Please, let me go)
I love you so

We don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do

I just heard you found the one you've been looking
You've been looking for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
'Cause even after all this time, I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily

Don't wanna know
What kinda dress you're wearin' tonight
If he's holdin' onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you outta my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore

There must be a good reason that you're gone
Every now and then, I think you
Might want me to come show up at your door
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong

Don't wanna know
If you're lookin' into her eyes
If she's holdin' onto you so tight
The way I did before

There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered, ""Have we met?""
Across the room, your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

The lingering question kept me up
2AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
Now, I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say
""Hey, it was enchanting to meet you""
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you
You might also like
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you


This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you

There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered, ""Have we met?""
Across the room, your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

The lingering question kept me up
2AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
Now, I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say
""Hey, it was enchanting to meet you""
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you

I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you


This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
Please don't be in love with someone else (Ooh)

Then I might bе onto somethin'
I ain't givin' you one in public

Sign first, middle, last on the wisdom tooth

And that dinner just like dessert too
And when we French, refresh, give me two
When I bite that lip, come get me too

Remember when we first met?
You said, ""Light my cigarette""
So I lied to my mum and dad
I jumped the fence and I ran
But we couldn't go very far
'Cause you locked your keys in your car
So you sat and stared at my lips
And I could already feel your kiss

Long nights, daydreams
Sugar and smoke rings, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
Headlights on me
Racing to 60, I've been a fool
Strawberries and cigarettes always taste like
Blue eyes, black jeans
Lighters and candy, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you

Remember when you taught me fate?
Said it'd all be worth the wait
Like that night in the back of the cab
When your fingers walked in my hand
Next day, nothin' on my phone
But I can still smell you on my clothes
Always hoping that things would change

I get my weed from California (That's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (Badass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (Yeah, that’s it)

And I say, oh (Oh)
The way I breathe you in (In)
It's the texture of your skin
I wanna wrap my arms around you, baby
Never let you go, oh
And I say, oh
There's nothing like your touch
It’s the way you lift me up, yeah
And I'll be right here with you 'til the end of time

I got my peaches out in Georgia (Oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (That's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (Badass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (Yeah, that's it)

You ain't sure yet
But I'm for ya
All I can want, all I can wish for
Nights alone that we miss more
And days we save as souvenirs
There's no time, I wanna make more time
And give you my whole life
I left my girl, I’m in Mallorca
Hate to leave her, call it torture
Remember when I couldn’t hold her
Left her baggage for Rimowa

Seeing you happy, one of the most beautiful things
The gift of love I've ever had
You make me believe, the sincerity of love
It was as if the story perfect 'd arrived
Still vividly remember, your warm embrace
As if all impossible to disappear
Now only memories, that you have left behind
No more time left together

Why is it still there?
Remaining feeling in the chest
When you just walk away
Can I survive?
Without you dear

You know my worst, see me hurt, but you don't judge
That, right there, is the scariest feeling
Opening and closing up again
I've been hurt so I don't trust
Now here we are, staring at the ceiling

If you don't wanna see me

Did a full one-eighty, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up

I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word ""goodbye""?
Though it took some time to survive you

If you don't wanna see me

Did a full one-eighty, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up

I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word ""goodbye""?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side

So far, I haven't thought about it
I've never had feelings for someone like you
If only I hadn't convinced myself from the start
Perfect speech, not as good as I thought

If I knew all would be in vain
I will not accept your momentary love

What if I already love you?
Those who come give hope, then leave and disappear
Unthinkable of you, my heart breaks because of you
Without the slightest reason, left without saying goodbye
I will not accept your momentary love

Thanks to you, I press the dusty rewind
A dance of off-beat
Let's exhale when winter comes
hotter breath

I can't see the end
Will there be an exit?
I can't move my feet, oh
close your eyes for a moment
hold my hand here
Let's run away to that future

Like an echo in the forest
the day will come
as if nothing happened
Yeah, life goes on
Like an arrow in the blue sky
fly another day
On my pillow, on my table
Yeah, life goes on
Like this again

I'll borrow this music and tell you (Ayy)
People say the world has changed (No)
Mm-mm-mm-mm
fortunately between us
still haven't changed
The usual start and end with the words ""Goodbye""
Let's connect today and tomorrow again (Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh-woah)
It's stopped, but don't hide in the dark
Because the light rises again

I can't see the end
Will there be an exit?
I can't move my feet oh
Close your eyes for a moment (close)
Take my hand right here (hold it)
Let's run away to that future (Oh, oh, oh)

We are, we are, we are

L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer

Everybody's lookin' for a come up
And they wanna know what you're about

We're just tryna figure everything out

Thursday, July 16, 2020
Running against the clock, but the clock hated me on 10 pm 20
Intricate day, let me say I was a little busy
Apply my family orders like a pizza man delivery
Jogging l3am kaml even I’m fat, like a machine gun
But 365 never shares or d-d-divided with me
History save!, before I get taped
I don’t wanna drop the key, I wanna be at the end a fairy tail
It’s time to spit what I’m felling on the paper
Shocking content get some sugar or bring some pepper
It took me days to write this with my flavor
I ain't got no wheels, I’m a true pro player like a faker
While I remember the girl that dated she was bhal Tayka
Evil with the makeup, then we break up
Zero percent chances like a naked, the truth rises the silence
The silence kills, Start the funeral, Bury me, invite the undertaker
I’m telling you Whenever, wherever whichever
Whoever I’m already dead inside, however
I just wanna recall the day that I stepped outside
Waddling like duck perhaps at the mid of night
Catching up a taxi Hello sir where you want to go
Please put me in avenue look at me
I called that, I struggle with that cuz I'm lonely
How this verse could be good enough if got somebody

Yeah, chilling on my room, eyes up on the roof
Listening to deathbed Powfu
Thinking on a clue for my puzzle to make proof
Life moves leisurely in such a sort of crossword clues
I don’t know why, why this make changes on me
Such randomly, occasionally through my moods
I guess that I’m not the only one with the same groove
Stir the water, the thirsty might show up with the same view
Take or leave it until another day
In any way, you’ll get that we’re all in the same crew
Maybe we’ll make Rendez-Vous in the heaven
For the remission of our sins just say Lahi3fu Or probably Hallelu
Well this, started already get me confused

I'm at a party I don't wanna be at
And I don't ever wear a suit and tie, yeah
Wonderin' if I could sneak out the back
Nobody's even lookin' me in my eyes
Then you take my hand
Finish my drink, say, ""Shall we dance?"" (Hell, yeah)
You know I love ya, did I ever tell ya?
You make it better like that

Don't think I fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say (Yeah)
I always feel like I'm nobody, mmm
Who wants to fit in anyway?

'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere

You know what? It's kinda crazy 'cause I really don't mind

When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true

Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable
So if you really wanna know

'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city

And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid

You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own

Tell me somethin', girl
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?

In all the good times, I find myself longin'
For change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryna fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?

In all the good times, I find myself longing
For change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?

I'm fallin'
In all the good times, I find myself longin'
For change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryna fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?

I'm falling
In all the good times, I find myself longing
For change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now

(Ah)

Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?
(World)
And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand new girl (Girl)

Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Well, good for you, I guess you're gettin' everything you want (Ah)
You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off (Ah)
It's like we never even happened
Baby, what the fuck is up with that? (Ah)
And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you? Well, screw that, and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do

Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
""Oh, my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"" Ayy
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So, it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
You might also like
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing, like
""Oh, my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So, it's gonna be forever

106,106,106,106,K,Clique,"83 ContributorsTop 20 Rap Albums of 2014 Lyrics20. Apollo Brown & Ras Kass - BlasphemyProducer/rapper collaboration albums are a rare sight in modern hip-hop, but Apollo Brown and Ras Kass make it work. This concept album has it all: religious fallacies, love songs, street life, and of course, raw rhymes. Production-wise, Apollo continues his trend of selecting and chopping up perfect samples, providing the perfect canvas for Razzy's sharp rhymes
Did we mention that it features artists such as Royce da 5'9"", Sean Price and Pharoahe Monch? It'd be blasphemous to say you support hip-hop and not give this album a spin - streetlights19. CyHi The Prynce - Black Hystori ProjectIn 2011, CyHi appeared in XXL's Freshman Class along with the likes of Kendrick Lamar, Meek Mill, Lil B and YG. Three years later, he proved himself worthy with the release of Black Hystori Project, his 6th mixtape and first released under the G.O.O.D. Music imprint. Executive produced by none other than Kanye West, Black Hystori Project serves more as a concept album than an ordinary mixtape
The project started when CyHi's nephew wanted to do an in-class Black History project on him. When his teacher said that he wasn't a big enough figure, he embarked on his own project. The tape highlights social issues, Black pride, and even has songs named after notable Black figures including Coretta Scott King, Nelson Mandela, and CyHi himself. Although the lyrical component of BHP is phenomenal, don't disregard the production. Handled primarily by M16 and TEC BEATZ, the uplifting, sample heavy instrumentation coincides perfectly with CyHi's proud take on Black history.   - streetlights18. Shady Records - ShadyXV

It's been 15 years since Eminem was thrust into superstardom with  the release of the The Slim Shady LP. As a result, Shady Records commemorated the milestone with the release of ShadyXV - a double disc LP featuring classic, and fresh material
The second disc functions as a greatest hits compilation and Shady Records had every hip hop fan feeling nostalgic.  Reliving classics like “Lose Yourself” and “In Da Club” over a decade later painted a timeless picture. While the latter half provided the nostalgia, disc one was what we'd really been waiting for.  The highlight of the new material was “Detroit Vs. Everybody” featuring  Big Sean, Danny Brown, Royce Da 5’9”, Eminem, Dej Loaf, and Trick Trick, proving cool delivery and cut throat lyricism continues to define Shady 15 years later.  -  Slickk17.Ghostface Killah - 36 Seasons

The most consistent member of the Clan slapped a single up the middle with this one. While the execution and ambition of his previous LP 12 Reasons To Die leaves this highly similar offering looking a bit plain, 36 Seasons is still another notch in GFK’s belt that achieves more than most 2014 releases
A concept album revolving around Dr. X’s resurrection of Tony Starks 9 years after his death, 36 Seasons is aided by AZ, Kool G. Rap, and Kandace Springs who each play a character in this story. Composed of themes we’ve seen before and a vaguely nostalgic, but rather ordinary soundtrack courtesy of The Revelations, 36 Chambers wasn’t designed to shake up the game. However, Ghostface’s consistent rhymes and a tracklist that cuts out all the fat combine to make this an album worth listening to.   -  Heisenferg16.Childish Gambino - STN MTN / Kauai

Childish Gambino gets the world we live in. because the internet exposed us to a postmodern compendium of multimedia genius and allowed us a glimpse into the frenetic mind of Donald Glover. STN MTN / Kauai allows us to see “mixtape Gambino” - the  no-frills assault rapper who impressed the hell out of us on R O Y A L T Y, and the deep thinker we fell in love with on because the internet.
The postmodern bent remains on skits and beats, but only as an enhancer to the dichotomous hip-hop storyline weaved into the mixtape. Donald Glover wants Kauai, an idyllic escape where he can free himself from the perils of fame. Childish Gambino can’t help but bring the Stone Mountain out of him, the grim realities of life in America, whose only way of being communicated is through blistering rhymes.  -  nietzsche15. Flying Lotus - You're Dead
The fifth album from Flying Lotus is the definition of a headphones album. Soundscapes presented throughout You’re Dead! are pure bliss; Flying Lotus blessed us with another thirty eight minutes of delectable ear candy. He blurs the line between stoner philosophy and serious ruminations on death, providing surprising clarity on metaphysical happenings in the form of astral projections and out of body experiences
This meditation on death throughout You’re Dead never gets conquered by the weight of its own concept. Instead, Ellison is able to maintain his playful spirit and in turn delivered one of the albums from 2014 that made us feel most alive. - BennySwans14. Ab-Soul - These Days…

Unlike  Control System, the self-proclaimed genius takes an unorthodox approach with These Days... by poking fun at ignorance present in the hip hop landscape.  Soulo  dips a bit outside of his comfort zone as he plays around with various styles. The abstract asshole that we all fell in love with proves both entertaining  and enlightening
He touches more on the death of his girlfriend Alori Joh on ""Closure"", features Action Bronson and Lupe Fiasco on album highlights; ""Stigmata"" & ""World Runners"" respectively, and lets Kendrick Lamar steal the show on  his interlude. A 23-minute battle as the outro, where he holds his own against battle rapper Daylyt is the icing on the cake.   -  SemGro813. Vince Staples - Hell Can Wait

While this EP consists of stories on the gang culture of Long Beach, Vince brings a crisp perspective to the “thug life”. Instead of embracing the violence like other mainstream rappers, Vince delivers stories from the  streets. He's  not the rapper you look to deliver double entendres and pop culture references,  he captures the listener with  gritty and descriptive lyrics
Vince's beat selection has gained a pinpoint accuracy. Whether he's snagging production from the legendary No I.D, or the buzzing Hagler, he makes the jump between bangers like ""Blue Suede” to compassionate tales such as “Limos” with ease. Forget Hell waiting: the world will be at his fingertips come 2015.  -  DC2612. Mac Miller - Faces

For a mixtape that could only be downloaded if you made Mac a virtual sandwich and an album cover that looks like it was done by Picasso on codeine, this was a pretty grounded project. Despite fears that Mac was going to go off the deep end on the mixtape follow-up to his impressive left-field LP Watching Movies With The Sound Off, Faces was a shift towards the center if anything
From Rozay features to eschewing the depressing WMWTSO instrumentals in favor of a jazz-influenced and uplifting sound, Mac is one of the few artists that can say his mixtape is more of an easy listen than his commercial release. That isn’t to say that Faces is a celebration of life - he’s still grappling with suicidal thoughts, drug addiction, and fake friends hanging with him for his money. But he is able to present these issues in a way that allows us to let out a laugh (albeit an uncomfortable one) rather than sincerely worry about his well-being.  -  Heisenferg11. Mick Jenkins - The WaterI does it with the flow and started talking all this water shit, it's like I started drowningWith different tales and themes, Mick connects everything back to the most abundant and important source on Earth - water. His soulful river of truth seems to splash on any listener and cause provoking, enlightened thoughts. Every beat feels like waves patting against the morning shore, but fits the theme of each song perfectly. Tracks like ""Shipwrecked"" start off soothing with ocean synths then suddenly transform into aggressive instrumentals filled with hi-hats and booming bass
His soothing, yet aggressive voice coupled with creative wordplay and sheer lyricism, Mick demonstrates why he's one the best in terms of lyrical ability and cohesiveness in 2014. Yes, Mick, Water is more important than the gold. SIP!  -  TheWaters10. Travi$ Scott - Days Before Rodeo

While many of the year’s best releases taught us about the artist(s) behind the project or the state of American race relations, Travi$ schooled us in the virtues of sound. The churning chants behind ""Skyfall"" provide a steady momentum of adrenaline before Young Thug bursts forth with characteristic energy. The beat on ""Quintana Pt. 2"" abruptly jolts forward to make way for the best verse on the album, one that goes uncredited to T.I. And the crowning achievement, fitting because it is Travi$ and nobody else, is the temptation anthem ""Drugs You Should Try"" - urging you to act on your basest desires while sounding like the impending regret that so often comes from such decisions
In a genre shifting toward prioritizing sounds over syllabic superiority, Travi$ Scott’s Days Before Rodeo serves as an exciting preview for his debut full-length Rodeo. What’s most exciting is that, given his history, it’ll be a mastering of a sound we’ve yet to even hear.  -  nietzsche9. PRhyme - PRhyme

Premier provides a slick backdrop, with his trademark sound sampling solely from Adrian Younge's material. Not only is the production a nod to the 90's, but it's also sprinkled with semi-modern vibes. In other words - it transcends time. Royce hits the booth with a sober mind and is arguably more focused and polished as an emcee than ever before. His raps are intricate and effortlessly display a plethora of phenomenal flows while dropping plenty of gems along the way
It's worth noting this is the first feature heavy album Royce has crafted, and it's very rare for him to collaborate with people outside of his clique. The features that join the ride all have solid contributions and compliment the tracks they appear on.  Royce even got a hand of Jay Electronica, something only a few have dared before him. There's no doubt this will be cherished for quite some time, as Royce said - ""consider it a gift to hip hop"".  -  ScopeY8. YG - My Krazy LifeNot getting nominated for a Grammy is like a slap in the faceBompton’s YG had one of the best records of the year. Whether it’s his infectious flow, or DJ Mustard’s dirty beats, this LP is the quintessential West Coast sound. Featuring fellow L.A MC’s ScHoolboy Q, Jay Rock & Kendrick Lamar, ""I Just Wanna Party” & “Really Be (Smokin & Drinkin)” are stand out tracks. We get bangers like “My Nigga”, but we’re also blessed with a storyline that culminates to the beautiful “Sorry Momma”.
The picture YG paints makes us want to ""bick back and be bool"" at Roscoes on a beautiful Cali day. So make sure to tell your friends when they watch the Grammys: the cousin of good kid m.A.A.d city lives up to the hype.  -  Tyrant7. Isaiah Rashad - Cilvia Demo
Cilvia Demo is more than just a strong freshman album, it is a testament of the new Golden Age of Hip-Hop we've been blessed with. Through vivid story-telling and aptly balanced nostalgia and melancholia, Isaiah paints pictures of innocent childhood and angst teens; working his way up to a confused and hectic entry into adulthood
He offers us  a prime example of cohesive structure, seamlessly flowing over the grandiosely mood encompassing instrumentals. Each feature and beat selection works in tandem to build the frame on which Isaiah splashes his life and soul onto. Hip Hop's best kept secret is out - Isaiah is in the front row of the New School’s best lyricists.  -  LewAshby6.  Logic - Under Pressure
Under Pressure has Logic putting every aspect of his craft on display. He makes a clear break with the past Young Sinatra mixtapes and shows his intent to have a serious interaction with fans. Logic brings some old lines from his lesser known songs back to life, and even pays homage to other rappers' album concepts. He also gets more personal, revealing details like his nicotine addiction
With NO I.D executively producing this album, and the in-house producer 6ix on most of the beats, everything was done to make a perfect sound for this piece of art. Whether hip hop heads or music lovers in general listen to this album for the intricate lines or for the sound, one thing’s sure, they’re in for a treat.  -  Adelin5. Big K.R.I.T. - CadillacticaCadillactica is the perfect follow-up to K.R.I.T.'s previous works. What we end up with is the jazzy Southerner we are all familiar with mixed with even better lyrics, vocal presence and 808's
For about a year Young Krizzle has been describing Cadillactica as a complete planet he created and it's nothing short of that. There aren't many flaws to find in an album which subtitles ""Kreation"" and ""Mt. Olympus"""" as its intro and reprise, respectively - that is, if there are any at all.  The irony is Life From the Underground made some people think he would be better off creating mixtapes. Whether intentional or not Cadillactica is a response to that, and proves KRIT doesn't plan on leaving the Major Leagues any time soon.   -  Dyazz4. J.Cole - 2014 Forest Hills Drive

Regarded as one of the elite artists of his generation, J. Cole has yet to release an acclaimed album that matches the success of his earlier mixtapes. With the surprise release of his third LP, Cole aims to change that as he goes back to his roots in 2014 Forest Hills Drive. Beginning with a young Cole in the Ville, we see him grow through his teenage year to eventually move to New York. After realising his potential and making it to Hollywood, he gets trapped in the glamour and starts to doubt himself. After this epiphany in the latter third of the album, we hear some of Cole's most introspective words to date
While standout tracks include “03' Adolesence”, “Fire Squad”, “Love Yourz” and ""A Tale of 2 Citiez"", the album hasn't received the critical acclaim he would have hoped for. Good thing for Cole he doesn't care for what the critics have to say - the fans have certainly enjoyed it, and as Hov once said, ""men lie, women lie, numbers don't"".  -  zk1233. ScHoolboy Q - Oxymoron

EverytHing ScHoolboy Q does just oozes of cHarisma, and tHis creates a dope album experience from front to back. WHile THe paradoxical nature of his fatHer-daugHter relationship puts tHe trapping aspect into perspective, Q has plenty in tHe clip with bangers like  ""Gangsta"" and ""Man Of THe Year"". He's not a one trick pony tHougH, Q provides personal/introspective lyrics on tHe likes of ""Studio"" & ""Prescription"".
THis album made gun rap cool again. His influence was so strong even grannies across tHe globe was rocking bucket Hats and enjoying some strong kusH. THe success ScHoolboy acHieved witH tHis pusHed Him to tHe forefront of Hip Hop as our current go-to party gangsta. THis bumps in tHe wHip for sure, word to Feefo.  -  ScopeY2. Freddie Gibbs & Madlib- Piñata

There's always less to say with the best albums. It's crack-rap done in the best ways possible. Flawless soulful beats throughout accompanies vivid narratives from a more than capable MC. Is it Madlib's best work? It's up there. Is it Freddie Gibbs' best work? Yes. Gibbs' flow over the violins on ’‘Shitsville’‘ is nothing but superb, and is one of a ton of impressive moments from Gibbs on the LP. The flaws are rare so with tracks like ’‘Thuggin’‘ ,’‘Uno’‘ ,’‘Shitsville’‘, ’‘Shame’‘ & ’‘High’‘ this album is definitely worth investing your time and money in.  -  AlvvaysSavvy1. Run The Jewels - Run The Jewels 2

El-P provides a rattling, gritty sound that packs a heavy punch on every song. Killer Mike launches a war against all the fuckbois of the world, so if you identify yourself as one, it's best to go into hiding. Sucking dicks, running backwards into dicks and generally being dicks are all common occurrences on the LP. We aren't mad at it though - it's stated so eloquently it's like the Queen of England was saying it. Not to mention, ""Jeopardy"" the intro track of the year could make the most peaceful person want to beat the shit out of their neighbour, for no reason at all. And they don't feature just anyone, every addition thrown into the mix are unique as well in their own right offering their own flair. We have a rare appearance from Zack de la Rocha, a raunchy verse from Gangsta Boo, and something very mysterious from the talented boots, plus more
In the midst of all the violent antics there are political undertones and social commentary. On ""Early"" Mike speaks with the same urgency that makes Run The Jewels 2 such a powerful experience.  He knows what it’s like not to have asylum, and he knows that we’re not in a post-race America
It's intense, it's aggressive, it's dynamic, it's loud and we are still in awe over its crazy beauty - necks were broken during the listening sessions. One things for sure, magic like this doesn't happen every day, so if you're yet to enter the world of RTJ - you're probably listening to cats meowing. Oh wait... -   ScopeY, nietzsche, & Tyrant

Royce hits the booth with a sober mind and is arguably more focused and polished as an emcee than ever before. His raps are intricate and effortlessly display a plethora of phenomenal flows while dropping plenty of gems along the way
It's worth noting this is the first feature heavy album Royce has crafted, and it's very rare for him to collaborate with people outside of his clique. The features that join the ride all have solid contributions and compliment the tracks they appear on.  Royce even got a hand of Jay Electronica, something only a few have dared before him. There's no doubt this will be cherished for quite some time, as Royce said - ""consider it a gift to hip hop"".  -  ScopeY8. YG - My Krazy LifeNot getting nominated for a Grammy is like a slap in the faceBompton’s YG had one of the best records of the year. Whether it’s his infectious flow, or DJ Mustard’s dirty beats, this LP is the quintessential West Coast sound. Featuring fellow L.A MC’s ScHoolboy Q, Jay Rock & Kendrick Lamar, ""I Just Wanna Party” & “Really Be (Smokin & Drinkin)” are stand out tracks. We get bangers like “My Nigga”, but we’re also blessed with a storyline that culminates to the beautiful “Sorry Momma”.
The picture YG paints makes us want to ""bick back and be bool"" at Roscoes on a beautiful Cali day. So make sure to tell your friends when they watch the Grammys: the cousin of good kid m.A.A.d city lives up to the hype.  -  Tyrant7. Isaiah Rashad - Cilvia Demo
Cilvia Demo is more than just a strong freshman album, it is a testament of the new Golden Age of Hip-Hop we've been blessed with. Through vivid story-telling and aptly balanced nostalgia and melancholia, Isaiah paints pictures of innocent childhood and angst teens; working his way up to a confused and hectic entry into adulthood
He offers us  a prime example of cohesive structure, seamlessly flowing over the grandiosely mood encompassing instrumentals. Each feature and beat selection works in tandem to build the frame on which Isaiah splashes his life and soul onto. Hip Hop's best kept secret is out - Isaiah is in the front row of the New School’s best lyricists.  -  LewAshby6.  Logic - Under Pressure
Under Pressure has Logic putting every aspect of his craft on display. He makes a clear break with the past Young Sinatra mixtapes and shows his intent to have a serious interaction with fans. Logic brings some old lines from his lesser known songs back to life, and even pays homage to other rappers' album concepts. He also gets more personal, revealing details like his nicotine addiction
With NO I.D executively producing this album, and the in-house producer 6ix on most of the beats, everything was done to make a perfect sound for this piece of art. Whether hip hop heads or music lovers in general listen to this album for the intricate lines or for the sound, one thing’s sure, they’re in for a treat.  -  Adelin5. Big K.R.I.T. - CadillacticaCadillactica is the perfect follow-up to K.R.I.T.'s previous works. What we end up with is the jazzy Southerner we are all familiar with mixed with even better lyrics, vocal presence and 808's
For about a year Young Krizzle has been describing Cadillactica as a complete planet he created and it's nothing short of that. There aren't many flaws to find in an album which subtitles ""Kreation"" and ""Mt. Olympus"""" as its intro and reprise, respectively - that is, if there are any at all.  The irony is Life From the Underground made some people think he would be better off creating mixtapes. Whether intentional or not Cadillactica is a response to that, and proves KRIT doesn't plan on leaving the Major Leagues any time soon.   -  Dyazz4. J.Cole - 2014 Forest Hills Drive

Regarded as one of the elite artists of his generation, J. Cole has yet to release an acclaimed album that matches the success of his earlier mixtapes. With the surprise release of his third LP, Cole aims to change that as he goes back to his roots in 2014 Forest Hills Drive. Beginning with a young Cole in the Ville, we see him grow through his teenage year to eventually move to New York. After realising his potential and making it to Hollywood, he gets trapped in the glamour and starts to doubt himself. After this epiphany in the latter third of the album, we hear some of Cole's most introspective words to date
While standout tracks include “03' Adolesence”, “Fire Squad”, “Love Yourz” and ""A Tale of 2 Citiez"", the album hasn't received the critical acclaim he would have hoped for. Good thing for Cole he doesn't care for what the critics have to say - the fans have certainly enjoyed it, and as Hov once said, ""men lie, women lie, numbers don't"".  -  zk1233. ScHoolboy Q - Oxymoron

EverytHing ScHoolboy Q does just oozes of cHarisma, and tHis creates a dope album experience from front to back. WHile THe paradoxical nature of his fatHer-daugHter relationship puts tHe trapping aspect into perspective, Q has plenty in tHe clip with bangers like  ""Gangsta"" and ""Man Of THe Year"". He's not a one trick pony tHougH, Q provides personal/introspective lyrics on tHe likes of ""Studio"" & ""Prescription"".
THis album made gun rap cool again. His influence was so strong even grannies across tHe globe was rocking bucket Hats and enjoying some strong kusH. THe success ScHoolboy acHieved witH tHis pusHed Him to tHe forefront of Hip Hop as our current go-to party gangsta. THis bumps in tHe wHip for sure, word to Feefo.  -  ScopeY2. Freddie Gibbs & Madlib- Piñata

There's always less to say with the best albums. It's crack-rap done in the best ways possible. Flawless soulful beats throughout accompanies vivid narratives from a more than capable MC. Is it Madlib's best work? It's up there. Is it Freddie Gibbs' best work? Yes. Gibbs' flow over the violins on ’‘Shitsville’‘ is nothing but superb, and is one of a ton of impressive moments from Gibbs on the LP. The flaws are rare so with tracks like ’‘Thuggin’‘ ,’‘Uno’‘ ,’‘Shitsville’‘, ’‘Shame’‘ & ’‘High’‘ this album is definitely worth investing your time and money in.  -  AlvvaysSavvy1. Run The Jewels - Run The Jewels 2

El-P provides a rattling, gritty sound that packs a heavy punch on every song. Killer Mike launches a war against all the fuckbois of the world, so if you identify yourself as one, it's best to go into hiding. Sucking dicks, running backwards into dicks and generally being dicks are all common occurrences on the LP. We aren't mad at it though - it's stated so eloquently it's like the Queen of England was saying it. Not to mention, ""Jeopardy"" the intro track of the year could make the most peaceful person want to beat the shit out of their neighbour, for no reason at all. And they don't feature just anyone, every addition thrown into the mix are unique as well in their own right offering their own flair. We have a rare appearance from Zack de la Rocha, a raunchy verse from Gangsta Boo, and something very mysterious from the talented boots, plus more
In the midst of all the violent antics there are political undertones and social commentary. On ""Early"" Mike speaks with the same urgency that makes Run The Jewels 2 such a powerful experience.  He knows what it’s like not to have asylum, and he knows that we’re not in a post-race America
It's intense, it's aggressive, it's dynamic, it's loud and we are still in awe over its crazy beauty - necks were broken during the listening sessions. One things for sure, magic like this doesn't happen every day, so if you're yet to enter the world of RTJ - you're probably listening to cats meowing. Oh wait... -   ScopeY, nietzsche, & Tyrant

어차피 떠나면 상처투성인
채로 미워하게 될걸
끝장을 보기 전 끝낼 순 없어
이 아픔을 기다린 것처럼

아마 다 잠깐 일지도 몰라

You and me, we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the proof's in the way it hurts
For months on end, I've had my doubts
Denyin' every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here

And you say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me ""baby""
I know I'm not the only one

You've been so unavailable
Now, sadly, I know why
Your heart is unobtainable
Even though Lord knows you kept mine

And you say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me ""baby""
I know I'm not the only one
You might also like
I have loved you for many years
Maybe I am just not enough
You've made me realise my deepest fear
By lyin' and tearin' us up

And all I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach but I stand
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high waisted shorts, oh

She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no

'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love the taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside, it starts to pour
You might also like
Comin' down

And all I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach but I stand
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high waisted shorts, oh

She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no

'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love the taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside, it starts to pour

Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So honey, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud

And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way

마치 달과 강처럼 (그리곤 또 껴안아, yeah)

You got me feeling like a psycho, psycho

Ooh, ooh, hey, yeah
Hmm, yeah, psycho

maybe i like you
It's the first time I've felt like this
Up and down is a bit severe
Adjustment is not good
One thing is certain
I don't play the game

They say we’re really weird
i just love it so much
you know it all too well
grab me
I am the same (Oh-oh-oh)

We're so quirky and strange
break each other (break)
Then hug again (and hug again)

A fool who loves each other, a fool who dies (idiot, fool)

Hey, now we'll be okay

Hey, trouble
You come without warning

We used to be like this, yeah
I'm not afraid (only interesting)

Even if you kick hard
You sometimes smile at me

We are beautiful and very sad
Let each other shine (Tell me now)

So you can't go, go, go

I'm in my bed
And you're not here
And there's no one to blame but the drink in my wandering hands
Forget what I said
It's not what I meant
And I can't take it back, I can't unpack the baggage you left

What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'

You said you cared, and you missed me too
And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you
And the coffee's out at the Beachwood Cafe
And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say

What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?

One to love, and one to lose
Sweet divine, a heavy truth

Drunk on a feeling, alone with the stars in the sky

I was distracted and in traffic
I didn't feel it when the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin', were you out drinkin'?
Were you in the living room, chillin', watchin' television?
It's been a year now, think I've figured out how
How to let you go and let communication die out

I know, you know, we know you weren't
Down for forever and it's fine
I know, you know, we know we weren't
Meant for each other and it's fine

But if the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it?
All our fears would be irrelevant
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
The sky'd be falling and I'd hold you tight
And there wouldn't be a reason why
We would even have to say goodbye
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right? Right?
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right? Right?

I tried to imagine your reaction

But it really got me thinkin', the night we went drinkin'
Stumbled in the house and didn't make it past the kitchen

How to think about you without it rippin' my heart out

Ay, ¡Fonsi! ¡D.Y.!
Ooh, oh, no, oh, no, oh
¡Hey, yeah!
Dididiri Daddy, go!
Sí, sabes que ya llevo un rato mirándote
Tengo que bailar contigo hoy (¡D.Y.!)
Vi que tu mirada ya estaba llamándome
Muéstrame el camino que yo voy

¡Oh!
Tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Sólo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso (¡Oh, yeah!)
Ya, ya me está gustando más de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro
Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmar las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito

Si te pido un beso, ven, dámelo, yo sé que estás pensándolo (Eh)
Llevo tiempo intentándolo (Eh), mami, esto es dando y dándolo
Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bam-bam
Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bam-bam
Ven, prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe (Eh-eh; ¡plo!)
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empezamos lento, después salvaje

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamo' pegando, poquito a poquito
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamo' pegando, poquito a poquito (Oh-oh)
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas (No, no)
Pero pa' montarlo aquí tengo la pieza

Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito (Yo')
Deja que te diga cosas al oído (Yo')

Hasta que las olas griten: ""¡Ay, Bendito!""
Para que mi sello se quede contigo

Ooh, oh, no, oh, no, oh
Hey yeah!
Dididiri Daddy, go!
Yes, you know that I've been looking at you for a while
I have to dance with you today (D.Y.!)
I saw that your look was already calling me
Show me the way that I'm going

Oh!
You, you are the magnet and I am the metal
I am getting closer and I am putting together the plan
Just thinking about it makes your pulse race (Oh, yeah!)
Yeah, I'm liking it more than usual
All my senses are asking for more
This must be taken without any rush
Slowly
I want to breathe your neck slowly
Let me tell you things in my ear
So that you remember if you are not with me
Slowly
I want to undress you with kisses slowly
Sign the walls of your maze
And make your body a whole manuscript

And forget your last name (Rrr; D.Y.)

If I ask you for a kiss, come, give it to me, I know you're thinking about it (Eh)
I've been trying for a while (Eh), mommy, this is giving and giving it
You know that your heart with me makes you bam-bam
You know that that baby is looking for my bam-bam
Come, taste my mouth to see how she tastes you (Eh-eh; plo!)
I want, I want, I want to see how much love fits you
I'm not in a hurry, I want to take the trip
We started slow, then wild

Step by step, soft, soft
We're going to hit each other, little by little
When you kiss me with that skill
I see that you are malice with delicacy
Step by step, soft, soft
We're going to hit each other, little by little (Oh-oh)
And that beauty is a puzzle (No, no)
But to assemble it here I have the piece
Hey! (I', I'; plo!)

I want to breathe your neck slowly (Yo')
Let me tell you things in your ear (Yo')
So that you remember if you're not with me (Plo, plo)

Let's do it on a beach in Puerto Rico
Until the waves cry: ""Oh, Blessed!""

Somebody said they saw you

And I would never ask you

I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you creepin', please don't let it show
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know

I think about it when I hold you
When lookin' in your eyes, I can't believe
And I don't need to know the truth
Baby, keep it to yourself

멈춘 시간 속 잠든 너를 찾아가
아무리 막아도 결국 너의 곁인 걸
길고 긴 여행을 끝내 이젠 돌아가
너라는 집으로 지금 다시 way back home

아무리 힘껏 닫아도 다시 열린 서랍 같아
하늘로 높이 날린 넌 자꾸 내게 되돌아와
힘들게 삼킨 이별도 다 그대로인 걸
수없이 떠난 길 위에서 난 너를 발견하고
비우려 했던 맘은 또 이렇게 너로 차올라
발걸음의 끝에 늘 네가 부딪혀
그만 그만

멈춘 시간 속 잠든 너를 찾아가
아무리 막아도 결국 너의 곁인 걸
길고 긴 여행을 끝내 이젠 돌아가
너라는 집으로 지금 다시 way back home

조용히 잠든 방을 열어 기억을 꺼내 들어
부서진 시간 위에서 선명히 너는 떠올라
길 잃은 마음속에 널 가둔 채 살아
그만 그만

세상을 뒤집어 찾으려 해
오직 너로 완결된 이야기를
모든 걸 잃어도 난 너 하나면 돼
빛이 다 꺼진 여기 나를 안아줘

눈을 감으면 소리 없이 밀려와
이 마음 그 위로 넌 또 한 겹 쌓여가
내겐 그 누구도 아닌 니가 필요해
돌아와 내 곁에 그날까지 I'm not done8Embed","10 ContributorsTranslationsRomanizationEnglishWay Back Home Lyrics
I go to find you sleeping in the stopped time
No matter how much I block you, in the end I'm by your side
After a long, long journey, I'm back now
To the house called you, now, way back home

No matter how hard I close it, it's like a drawer that opens again
You flew high into the sky and you keep coming back to me
Even the breakup I swallowed with difficulty is still the same
I found you on the countless roads
My heart that tried to empty is filled with you again like this
At the end of my steps, you always bump into me
stop stop

I go to find you sleeping in the stopped time
No matter how much I block you, in the end I'm by your side
After a long, long journey, I'm back now
To the house called you, now, way back home

Open the room where you sleep quietly and take out your memories
Above the broken time, you clearly come to mind
I live with you trapped in a lost heart
stop stop
You might also like
I go to find you sleeping in the stopped time
No matter how much I block you, in the end I'm by your side
After a long, long journey, I'm back now
To the house called you, now, way back home

Turn the world upside down and try to find it
A story that only ended with you
Even if I lose everything, I only need you
Hug me here where all the lights are off

When I close my eyes, it comes silently
On top of this heart, you pile up another layer
I need you, no one else
Come back to my side until that day I'm not done8Embed",ko,"{'light', 'keep', 'empty', 'filled', 'memory', 'stopped', 'journey', 'find', 'way', 'drawer', 'step', 'lose', 'turn', 'else', 'contributorstranslationsromanizationenglishway', 'found', 'high', 'time', 'live', 'hard', 'difficulty', 'countless', 'called', 'pile', 'stop', 'sleeping', 'silently', 'room', 'story', 'end', 'tried', 'bump', 'flew', 'lost', 'upside', 'quietly', 'sky', 'trapped', 'eye', 'long', 'broken', 'world', 'sleep', 'close', 'swallowed', 'back', 'try', 'layer', 'side', 'road', 'clearly', 'mind', 'open', 'heart', 'ended', 'home', 'block', 'hug', 'breakup', 'house', 'matter', 'top', 'lyric'}"

Walkin' down 29th and Park
I saw you in another's arm
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said somethin' to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do

Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're movin' on with someone new

'Cause, baby, you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then, I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

Hey-yeah, hey-yeah, hey-yeah

You're happier, aren't you?

145,145,145,145,H.E.R.,Best Part,"19 ContributorsRap Up 2020 Lyrics
Definitely did take a long time
2020 been a sad year
Wasn't gon' even do this
But I figured y'all needed me after everything that been goin' on
The homie Great John on the beat, by the way
Don't Come Outside, Volume 3 out now
Great John on the beat, by the way

I'm a fan Heavenly Father but right now I'm booing you
What did Kobe, Gigi and them other passengers do to you? (What they do?)
My condolences at this time is all I could offer
Kobe got me out here spendin' more time with my daughter (He do)
Takin' Kobe from us had the whole world stressed
You coulda took a average player, not one of the best
Somebody like Lamar Odom or Delonte West (Ah)
I'm just playin', but I'm sayin', we woulda missed them less (God bless)
I'm convinced God don't got the answers
First you take the Black Mamba from us, then the Black Panther (Damn)
Fuck 2020, this whole year started off wack
Best part of the year's here and that's hearin' me rap (You want it)
Hearin' me rap that straight up, 2020's a dub, nigga
Atlanta the only spot that ain't shut down they clubs, nigga (Lord)
Pandemic got niggas eatin' like Action Bronson
They ain't scared of catchin' the corona like Magic Johnson (You did)
Is it real? Is it fake? I don't know, I know shit sad
People dyin' from it off some shit that they been had
They said Trump had it but I think he was fakin' it
They got a vaccine now but I still ain't takin' it (God)
We all saw that nurse who passed out from that shit
Live on TV, miss me with that funny shit
I don't trust the government, they chasin' that fuckin' bag
Whole coronavirus shit feel like a money grab
They tryna get paid, virus is man-made
They actin' like this shit worser than cancer and AIDS (Than cancer)
Kids can't go to school, people can't go to work
Strip clubs closed, bitches ain't got nowhere to twerk (Nah)
Now they lookin' for sponsors, so I'm tellin' chicks, ""I'm broke""
That was prop money on the 'Gram, Kodak Black joke (I ain't got it)
I'm not a big fan of this next line I wrote
I hate the fact I gotta say, ""Rest in peace to Pop Smoke"" (Damn)
The good die young, it really wasn't his time
Him bein' dead and Tekashi still livin' is a crime
God, you gotta do better, you been fuckin' up lately
Bro, all I hear is Pop Smoke when I turn on my radio (Woo)
They play Pop so much it feel like he still here
Got us woo walkin', wearin' Dior just to be clear (Facts)
COVID-19 shit got Fred The Godson
One of the few emcees you could really get bars from
He represented real rap for real New Yorkers
My condolences to your wife and your two daughters
Kings killin' kings and it's bein' filmed on camera
Hated seein' niggas killing King Von in Atlanta (Wack)
Megan sayin' Tory shot her, he sayin' she cappin'
Them people that was in the truck with them told me what happened (They told me)
He wanted that wet-ass pussy, she ain't give him none
She hurt Tory ego and that's when he pulled out a gun
Then she tried to leave and that's when he start clappin'
I made that whole shit up but that sound like what really happened (Haha)
If he really did shoot her, that was some lame shit
She snitchin' now but she a girl so it ain't the same shit (Yeah)
We ain't lookin' at her like how we look at 6ix9ine
Lookin' at Tory like he played himself, fuck was on his mind? (What up?)
That bullet ain't faze her, her leg ain't even hurtin'
A week after she got shot, Meg was back twerkin' (Body-ody-ody-ody)
Been a crazy year, wouldn't you say?
Found out Jada Pinkett gave Will Smith pussy away (She did what?)
Tried to call it an entanglement so it don't sound like nothin'
No, it's called cheatin', Jada, you and August was fuckin' (God)
Got Will Smith out here lookin' like a whole sucker
Wonder how Jaden and Willow feel about they mother (Damn)
Fuck that Red Table, let's discuss some other shit
I wonder if Will asked Jada, did she suck his dick? (Woah)
Now he questionin' how you and 'Pac was out here movin'
He was lookin' stressed at the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air reunion (He was)
Actin' like he give a fuck 'bout how Aunt Viv feel
He probably think that she difficult to work with still (Haha, sheesh)
Cardi B filed for divorce
You know how her and Offset do, they back together, of course (Stop playin')
Dr. Dre wife tried to get two mill' a month
I know Dre happy that she signed that prenup
Dre my nigga, his business all in the street (All in the street)
How much of that man money she tryna keep?
She wasn't with him in the studio makin' them beats
Bitch, you wasn't with me in the studio makin' them beats (Woo)
Put your pussy lips on live, I'll give ya a thousand dollars
Boosie was bein' too thirsty, I'm just bein' honest (He was)
If doin' too much was a person
They deleted his account, now his shit ain't workin' (Damn)
Instagram missin' you, the Internet fuck with you
In that interview with Mike Tyson, you looked uncomfortable
For talkin' 'bout Dwyane Wade's son, he was pressin' you
He was askin' you if you was gay, he was disrespectin' you
Never seen Boosie Badazz talkin' so polite (Never)
He ain't want no smoke with that nigga Iron Mike (Uh-uh)
Woulda looked like Nate Robinson if Mike Tyson hit him
Rest in peace to the homie Mo3 who there with him (Damn)
Couple days after Mo3 died, Boosie got shot
Them Dallas niggas thought Boosie was tryna spin the block (Skrrt)
That nigga Akon was out here trippin'
Tryna explain and justify 6ix9ine snitchin'
I'm locked up, they won't let me out, we felt that
He tried to remix that old-ass record with a rat (You played yourself)
All these rappers gettin' shot, not one bullet hit Tekashi
They really let that nigga out early and kept Bobby (Free Rowdy)
You might also like
Y'all couldn't wait for this shit to drop
I really entertain y'all with all this shit I pop (I do, right?)
Every year 'round the same time, y'all check for me (Ah)
They like how I disrespect niggas respectfully (True)
Y'all heard what happened, y'all know what happened
But y'all don't care (Y'all don't care)
Y'all still want me to talk about this shit every year (Every year)
Crazy, crazy, shit crazy (I just don't wanna stop, crazy)
Crazy, crazy, shit crazy

Jeezy shouldn't have battled Gucci
Knowin' he was gon' rap about killin' his homie Pookie (Woo)
I get it but fuck all that culture shit
Disrespect my dead homie, I'm poppin' off, battle over with
Try to shoot the nigga up, cut the nigga, at least fuckin' fight
Niggas talk about smokin' on Pookie Loc tonight (Facts)
One of the most disrespectful things that I ever seen
Gucci ignorant but remind me of me when I was seventeen (He do)
Niggas on the streets sayin', ""Jeezy lost it""
That was some sucker shit, he movin' too corporate (Damn)
I ain't with that cool shit, I'm with that ra-ra
JAY-Z wouldn't battle Nas if Nas killed Ty Ty (He wouldn't)
Pookie rollin' over in his grave, you got him hurt
Watchin' you perform with the nigga that put him in the dirt
He prolly got some other issues, leave Jeezy alone
Big Meech brother Southwest T just came home
Let's talk about some shit that got the people upset
Cops that killed Breonna Taylor ain't get arrested yet
Attorney General Daniel Cameron fucked us all up
Them cops that killed Breonna got charged with shootin' the wall up
I repeat, Daniel Cameron is a sell-out
He in a sunken place, like that movie, can't Get Out
Defund the police, Obama said he don't believe in that
In the country where you can't even jog while bein' black (I'm disappointed)
Rest in peace to Ahmaud Arbery
An ex-cop killed him thinkin' he committed a robbery
George Floyd gettin' murdered was on the Internet
For eight minutes straight that cop had his knee on his neck
The whole world came together and protested
They ain't convict him yet but at least they did get arrested (Woo)
Unity was real, government start gettin' scared
We was marchin' like the coronavirus disappeared
White people was out here screamin', ""Black Lives Matter""
And honestly I think that was makin' the police madder (They scared)
And all Donald Trump did was talk about Louis
Nothin' 'bout the knee on the neck and police shootings
He encouraged the police violence
Trump dumbass told us, ""Take Lysol for the virus""
Said it was goin' away, of course he lyin'
Over three hundred thousand Americans done died
Lil Wayne and Lil Pump jumped on Trump dick
Now look, now they look stupid for doin' that dumb shit (They do)
And he lost the election, I know he embarrassed
He know he ain't lose to Joe, he lost to Kamala Harris
Joe Biden knew what he was doin' when he picked her
He knew we was comin' out to vote for a Black sister (We did)
Trump had to go but Joe Biden need to get smacked
For tellin' us if we don't vote for him, we ain't Black
I still think you racist and that's my problem with you
We only voted for you 'cause you got Kamala with you
And I'm not a fan of both of y'all reputations
You and Kamala responsible for mass incarcerations
Y'all the reason they won't leave us alone
The best news we got all year was Rowdy comin' home
It was dope seein' him on Instagram bein' celebrated
He a real one, he ain't fold when he got interrogated
Pharrell was on Drink Champs talkin' some stupid shit
Just 'cause you pay taxes don't make it cool to snitch
I hear about certain shit that make my ass smile
R. Kelly got beat up in jail, good for that pedophile
I'ma miss Donald Trump, can't front, he was funny
Obama gave us trap phones, Trump gave us re-up money
He was makin' y'all laugh too, I'm just remindin' you
He was out here callin' the coronavirus the China flu (It comes from China)
I appreciated that he ain't bite his tongue
If that second stimulus check had came, he mighta won (He mighta)
That unemployment money had y'all feelin' like Big Meech
You was ballin' with that extra six hundred dollars a week (Y'all was)
Bitch, that was better than your regular job
Certain chicks couldn't pay bills unless head was involved
Your OnlyFans page really wasn't poppin' for real
Now you know how a local mixtape rap nigga feel
Them SBA loans had niggas out here in all kinda shit
They was just bums, now they pullin' up with designer shit (Oh, you serious?)
I'ma miss fake beefin' with Casanova
I was about to get on him for fuckin' with Fashion Nova
He prolly like, ""This nigga Murda always gotta play""
I wish he woulda turned himself in after the holidays
Hope I made him laugh while he fightin' for his freedom
Know it's free my nigga Casanova 'til they free him (Oh yeah)
(Is it okay if I call her one?) Who said that shit?
That was Snoop callin' Gayle King a funky dog head bitch
For goin' at Kobe with no consideration
On how his family was feelin' knowin' the situation
LeBron got his fourth ring, you gotta respect his shit
He was tired of hearin' y'all talkin' all that Kawhi Leonard shit
He gon' repeat this year, the Lakers look like a bigger threat
L.A. needed that, they ain't even get over Nipsey yet
That corona had niggas ballin' in a bubble
For James Harden, Houston already got rid of Russell
Y'all be disrespectin' Westbrook, that shit gotta stop
I ain't gon' lie, though, that nigga really don't got no jumpshot (Haha)
Lou Williams left the bubble to go to Magic City for chicken wings
He ain't go there for no ass and titties
Kawhi Leonard and Paul George blew a three-one lead
And Giannis ain't deserve to be the MVP of the league
He get in the playoffs and he look like JaVale McGee
I know that's disrespectful but I mean that respectfully
Brooklyn is litty with KD and Kyrie
Madison Square Garden disrespectin' Spike Lee ('Cause no one told me)
Deontay Wilder lost his first fight
He got beat up by Tyson, I ain't talkin' 'bout Mike
Oh, the Tyson that he got beat up by was white (Was white)
(To this day) Can't believe he got beat up that night
Adrien Broner was on the ""Catch Me Outside"" girl page
In her DM, oh, he ain't know she was underage (What?)
Floyd Mayweather struggled saying ""epidemic""
Everyday Struggle got canceled, they fired Akademiks
We saw Wack 100 knockin' out a racist cracker
They tried to jump him like they ain't know Black Lives Matter (Haha)
Supposedly Kanye worth around three bill'
But that ain't stoppin' him from tweetin' about how he feel
He been tryna leave Kim since he met up with Meek Mill
He think Drake fucked her too and him and JAY don't speak still
Y'all couldn't wait for this time to come
Y'all already know that that nigga Murda don't bite his tongue (I don't)
You forgot about Nick Gordon, no, I didn't
So what? He dead, we ain't care about him when he was livin'
Always blamed him for Bobbi Kristina dyin'
So to act like I care that he dead, I'd be lyin'
My newborn was born on Valentine's Day
That's the best gift a nigga coulda got, what more could I say?
Nicki had a baby, congratulations
Her husband and Meek almost got in an altercation
They shoulda just got it on, like, nobody get the blicky
It woulda been funny watchin' them fightin' over Nicki
Cardi B and Megan had conservatives tryna ban 'em
For that wet-ass pussy record, then it became an anthem
Y'all couldn't wait for this shit to drop
I really entertain y'all with all this shit I pop (I do)
Every year 'round the same time, y'all check for me (Uh-huh)
They like how I disrespect niggas respectfully (Haha)
Y'all heard what happened, y'all know what happened
But y'all don't care (Yeah)
Y'all still want me to talk about this shit every year (Okay)
Crazy, crazy, shit crazy (Shit crazy)
Crazy, crazy, shit crazy (Woah, woah, woah, woah, shit crazy)
It's Great John beats, baby
Great John on the beat, by the way

I don't care if it still stink, I'ma leave her alone
Even though she out here wishin' R. Kelly was home (Damn)
Nick Cannon got fired for talkin' 'bout white people, he was Wild N Out
He forgot he work for white people
Scottie Pippen ex-wife still doin' ho shit
Jeremih almost died fuckin' around with that COVID
Ashanti got it too, they put the battle on hold
With O.T. Genasis arch-nemesis Keyshia Cole
Ashanti gon' win that battle, my girl love her
Irv Gotti was corny for tellin' Wendy he fucked her (He was)
Michael B. Jordan fuckin' Lori Harvey
I was on MSNBC with Ari (Woah)
Talkin' 'bout Trump gettin' impeached
We was politickin', look how far the Rap Up done reached
The first debate with Trump and Joe Biden was comedy
That's when I realized we gon' be fucked either way, honestly
Oprah and Gayle King still don't realize why we upset
We realize they ain't talk about Harvey Weinstein yet
Fuck whoever not with us, nigga, that's how I play
Rest in peace to that nigga Deebo from Friday
I hate 2020, this whole year had a nigga tight
Can't believe I'm sayin' rest in peace to my nigga Light
Dave East, where you at, homie? I hope you listenin'
Told my nigga Light to tell Shooter you fuckin' missin' him
Condolences to your fam' and your niggas in Queensbridge
We was gon' shoot a video for the record we did
Can't believe I'm tellin' my nigga Hank, ""Rest in peace""
Believe me when I tell you that this year was stressin' me (It was)
This year I really wasn't even gon' do this shit
Wasn't in the mood to laugh and joke about no stupid shit (Wasn't)
Then niggas just kept doin' stupid shit
Then I saw that Snoop Dogg post, like, I gotta do this shit (Okay)
Flex lost weight but he ain't do it the hard way
That nigga cheated, he went and got lipo' like Kanye
So many rappers got shot, I could be here forever
Joey Dollas got hit up, I hope he get better (Damn)
The Verzuz battles durin' quarantine was savin' us
Real talk, I wrote this shit while I was Jada drunk (I did)
Salute to Timbaland and Swizz Beatz
But a few battles y'all put together put us to sleep
Lil Baby got money so it's cool if he like to trick
It wasn't sixteen bands, though, bitch, it was only six
For kids in Philly, Meek do plenty of shit
How you gon' give them kids from Atlanta a $20 to split?
How nobody ain't whip Akademik ass yet?
On Clubhouse, Meek told him he got his address (Ha)
Zimmermann still livin', we should all be ashamed
50 got a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame
JAY-Z distributin' marijuana
This nigga A$AP Rocky fuckin' on Rihanna (Woah)
Everybody masked up, shit is the new normal
The feds is on Clubhouse, don't say I didn't warn you
Y'all wanted twenty minutes, I was gon' really try it
But I was in that motherfuckin' booth gettin' tired
Like LeBron said, I want my damn respect
R.I.P. to the homie Alex Trebek
Shit crazy, nigga, this year was hard as hell
Icons died, rest in peace to Andre Harrell
Without him it wouldn't have been no Diddy (Wouldn't have)
So that mean it probably wouldn't have been no Biggie (Facts)
You see how important he was? So that shit hit me
I almost forgot to mention, you my nigga, forgive me
Fuck 2020, I'm done, it's a wrap here
I ain't doin' this shit no more, this is my last year2Embed","19 ContributorsRap Up 2020 Lyrics

What did Kobe, Gigi and them other passengers do to you? (What they do?)
My condolences at this time is all I could offer
Kobe got me out here spendin' more time with my daughter (He do)

Dre my nigga, his business all in the street (All in the street)
How much of that man money she tryna keep?
She wasn't with him in the studio makin' them beats
Bitch, you wasn't with me in the studio makin' them beats (Woo)
Put your pussy lips on live, I'll give ya a thousand dollars
Boosie was bein' too thirsty, I'm just bein' honest (He was)
If doin' too much was a person
They deleted his account, now his shit ain't workin' (Damn)
Instagram missin' you, the Internet fuck with you
In that interview with Mike Tyson, you looked uncomfortable
For talkin' 'bout Dwyane Wade's son, he was pressin' you
He was askin' you if you was gay, he was disrespectin' you
Never seen Boosie Badazz talkin' so polite (Never)
He ain't want no smoke with that nigga Iron Mike (Uh-uh)
Woulda looked like Nate Robinson if Mike Tyson hit him
Rest in peace to the homie Mo3 who there with him (Damn)
Couple days after Mo3 died, Boosie got shot
Them Dallas niggas thought Boosie was tryna spin the block (Skrrt)
That nigga Akon was out here trippin'
Tryna explain and justify 6ix9ine snitchin'
I'm locked up, they won't let me out, we felt that
He tried to remix that old-ass record with a rat (You played yourself)
All these rappers gettin' shot, not one bullet hit Tekashi
They really let that nigga out early and kept Bobby (Free Rowdy)
You might also like
Y'all couldn't wait for this shit to drop
I really entertain y'all with all this shit I pop (I do, right?)
Every year 'round the same time, y'all check for me (Ah)
They like how I disrespect niggas respectfully (True)
Y'all heard what happened, y'all know what happened
But y'all don't care (Y'all don't care)
Y'all still want me to talk about this shit every year (Every year)
Crazy, crazy, shit crazy (I just don't wanna stop, crazy)
Crazy, crazy, shit crazy

Jeezy shouldn't have battled Gucci
Knowin' he was gon' rap about killin' his homie Pookie (Woo)
I get it but fuck all that culture shit
Disrespect my dead homie, I'm poppin' off, battle over with
Try to shoot the nigga up, cut the nigga, at least fuckin' fight
Niggas talk about smokin' on Pookie Loc tonight (Facts)
One of the most disrespectful things that I ever seen
Gucci ignorant but remind me of me when I was seventeen (He do)
Niggas on the streets sayin', ""Jeezy lost it""
That was some sucker shit, he movin' too corporate (Damn)
I ain't with that cool shit, I'm with that ra-ra
JAY-Z wouldn't battle Nas if Nas killed Ty Ty (He wouldn't)
Pookie rollin' over in his grave, you got him hurt
Watchin' you perform with the nigga that put him in the dirt
He prolly got some other issues, leave Jeezy alone
Big Meech brother Southwest T just came home
Let's talk about some shit that got the people upset
Cops that killed Breonna Taylor ain't get arrested yet
Attorney General Daniel Cameron fucked us all up
Them cops that killed Breonna got charged with shootin' the wall up
I repeat, Daniel Cameron is a sell-out
He in a sunken place, like that movie, can't Get Out
Defund the police, Obama said he don't believe in that
In the country where you can't even jog while bein' black (I'm disappointed)
Rest in peace to Ahmaud Arbery
An ex-cop killed him thinkin' he committed a robbery
George Floyd gettin' murdered was on the Internet
For eight minutes straight that cop had his knee on his neck
The whole world came together and protested
They ain't convict him yet but at least they did get arrested (Woo)
Unity was real, government start gettin' scared
We was marchin' like the coronavirus disappeared
White people was out here screamin', ""Black Lives Matter""
And honestly I think that was makin' the police madder (They scared)
And all Donald Trump did was talk about Louis
Nothin' 'bout the knee on the neck and police shootings
He encouraged the police violence
Trump dumbass told us, ""Take Lysol for the virus""
Said it was goin' away, of course he lyin'
Over three hundred thousand Americans done died
Lil Wayne and Lil Pump jumped on Trump dick
Now look, now they look stupid for doin' that dumb shit (They do)
And he lost the election, I know he embarrassed
He know he ain't lose to Joe, he lost to Kamala Harris
Joe Biden knew what he was doin' when he picked her
He knew we was comin' out to vote for a Black sister (We did)
Trump had to go but Joe Biden need to get smacked
For tellin' us if we don't vote for him, we ain't Black
I still think you racist and that's my problem with you
We only voted for you 'cause you got Kamala with you
And I'm not a fan of both of y'all reputations
You and Kamala responsible for mass incarcerations
Y'all the reason they won't leave us alone
The best news we got all year was Rowdy comin' home
It was dope seein' him on Instagram bein' celebrated
He a real one, he ain't fold when he got interrogated
Pharrell was on Drink Champs talkin' some stupid shit
Just 'cause you pay taxes don't make it cool to snitch
I hear about certain shit that make my ass smile
R. Kelly got beat up in jail, good for that pedophile
I'ma miss Donald Trump, can't front, he was funny
Obama gave us trap phones, Trump gave us re-up money
He was makin' y'all laugh too, I'm just remindin' you
He was out here callin' the coronavirus the China flu (It comes from China)
I appreciated that he ain't bite his tongue
If that second stimulus check had came, he mighta won (He mighta)
That unemployment money had y'all feelin' like Big Meech
You was ballin' with that extra six hundred dollars a week (Y'all was)
Bitch, that was better than your regular job
Certain chicks couldn't pay bills unless head was involved
Your OnlyFans page really wasn't poppin' for real
Now you know how a local mixtape rap nigga feel
Them SBA loans had niggas out here in all kinda shit
They was just bums, now they pullin' up with designer shit (Oh, you serious?)
I'ma miss fake beefin' with Casanova
I was about to get on him for fuckin' with Fashion Nova
He prolly like, ""This nigga Murda always gotta play""
I wish he woulda turned himself in after the holidays
Hope I made him laugh while he fightin' for his freedom
Know it's free my nigga Casanova 'til they free him (Oh yeah)
(Is it okay if I call her one?) Who said that shit?
That was Snoop callin' Gayle King a funky dog head bitch
For goin' at Kobe with no consideration
On how his family was feelin' knowin' the situation
LeBron got his fourth ring, you gotta respect his shit
He was tired of hearin' y'all talkin' all that Kawhi Leonard shit
He gon' repeat this year, the Lakers look like a bigger threat
L.A. needed that, they ain't even get over Nipsey yet
That corona had niggas ballin' in a bubble
For James Harden, Houston already got rid of Russell
Y'all be disrespectin' Westbrook, that shit gotta stop
I ain't gon' lie, though, that nigga really don't got no jumpshot (Haha)
Lou Williams left the bubble to go to Magic City for chicken wings
He ain't go there for no ass and titties
Kawhi Leonard and Paul George blew a three-one lead
And Giannis ain't deserve to be the MVP of the league
He get in the playoffs and he look like JaVale McGee
I know that's disrespectful but I mean that respectfully
Brooklyn is litty with KD and Kyrie
Madison Square Garden disrespectin' Spike Lee ('Cause no one told me)
Deontay Wilder lost his first fight
He got beat up by Tyson, I ain't talkin' 'bout Mike
Oh, the Tyson that he got beat up by was white (Was white)
(To this day) Can't believe he got beat up that night
Adrien Broner was on the ""Catch Me Outside"" girl page
In her DM, oh, he ain't know she was underage (What?)
Floyd Mayweather struggled saying ""epidemic""
Everyday Struggle got canceled, they fired Akademiks
We saw Wack 100 knockin' out a racist cracker
They tried to jump him like they ain't know Black Lives Matter (Haha)
Supposedly Kanye worth around three bill'
But that ain't stoppin' him from tweetin' about how he feel
He been tryna leave Kim since he met up with Meek Mill
He think Drake fucked her too and him and JAY don't speak still
Y'all couldn't wait for this time to come
Y'all already know that that nigga Murda don't bite his tongue (I don't)
You forgot about Nick Gordon, no, I didn't
So what? He dead, we ain't care about him when he was livin'
Always blamed him for Bobbi Kristina dyin'
So to act like I care that he dead, I'd be lyin'
My newborn was born on Valentine's Day
That's the best gift a nigga coulda got, what more could I say?
Nicki had a baby, congratulations
Her husband and Meek almost got in an altercation
They shoulda just got it on, like, nobody get the blicky
It woulda been funny watchin' them fightin' over Nicki
Cardi B and Megan had conservatives tryna ban 'em
For that wet-ass pussy record, then it became an anthem
Y'all couldn't wait for this shit to drop
I really entertain y'all with all this shit I pop (I do)
Every year 'round the same time, y'all check for me (Uh-huh)
They like how I disrespect niggas respectfully (Haha)
Y'all heard what happened, y'all know what happened
But y'all don't care (Yeah)
Y'all still want me to talk about this shit every year (Okay)
Crazy, crazy, shit crazy (Shit crazy)
Crazy, crazy, shit crazy (Woah, woah, woah, woah, shit crazy)

Scottie Pippen ex-wife still doin' ho shit

Irv Gotti was corny for tellin' Wendy he fucked her (He was)
Michael B. Jordan fuckin' Lori Harvey
I was on MSNBC with Ari (Woah)
Talkin' 'bout Trump gettin' impeached
We was politickin', look how far the Rap Up done reached
The first debate with Trump and Joe Biden was comedy
That's when I realized we gon' be fucked either way, honestly
Oprah and Gayle King still don't realize why we upset
We realize they ain't talk about Harvey Weinstein yet
Fuck whoever not with us, nigga, that's how I play
Rest in peace to that nigga Deebo from Friday
I hate 2020, this whole year had a nigga tight
Can't believe I'm sayin' rest in peace to my nigga Light
Dave East, where you at, homie? I hope you listenin'
Told my nigga Light to tell Shooter you fuckin' missin' him
Condolences to your fam' and your niggas in Queensbridge
We was gon' shoot a video for the record we did
Can't believe I'm tellin' my nigga Hank, ""Rest in peace""
Believe me when I tell you that this year was stressin' me (It was)
This year I really wasn't even gon' do this shit
Wasn't in the mood to laugh and joke about no stupid shit (Wasn't)
Then niggas just kept doin' stupid shit
Then I saw that Snoop Dogg post, like, I gotta do this shit (Okay)
Flex lost weight but he ain't do it the hard way
That nigga cheated, he went and got lipo' like Kanye
So many rappers got shot, I could be here forever
Joey Dollas got hit up, I hope he get better (Damn)
The Verzuz battles durin' quarantine was savin' us
Real talk, I wrote this shit while I was Jada drunk (I did)
Salute to Timbaland and Swizz Beatz
But a few battles y'all put together put us to sleep
Lil Baby got money so it's cool if he like to trick
It wasn't sixteen bands, though, bitch, it was only six
For kids in Philly, Meek do plenty of shit
How you gon' give them kids from Atlanta a $20 to split?
How nobody ain't whip Akademik ass yet?
On Clubhouse, Meek told him he got his address (Ha)
Zimmermann still livin', we should all be ashamed
50 got a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame
JAY-Z distributin' marijuana
This nigga A$AP Rocky fuckin' on Rihanna (Woah)
Everybody masked up, shit is the new normal
The feds is on Clubhouse, don't say I didn't warn you
Y'all wanted twenty minutes, I was gon' really try it
But I was in that motherfuckin' booth gettin' tired
Like LeBron said, I want my damn respect
R.I.P. to the homie Alex Trebek
Shit crazy, nigga, this year was hard as hell
Icons died, rest in peace to Andre Harrell
Without him it wouldn't have been no Diddy (Wouldn't have)
So that mean it probably wouldn't have been no Biggie (Facts)
You see how important he was? So that shit hit me
I almost forgot to mention, you my nigga, forgive me
Fuck 2020, I'm done, it's a wrap here

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (Fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""
You might also like
I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself

147,147,147,147,Zac Efron,Rewrite The Stars,"141 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsRewrite the Stars Lyrics
You know I want you
It's not a secret I try to hide
I know you want me
So don't keep sayin' our hands are tied
You claim it's not in the cards
And fate is pulling you miles away and out of reach from me
But you're here in my heart
So who can stop me if I decide that you're my destiny?

What if we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine?
Nothing could keep us apart
You'd be the one I was meant to find
It's up to you and it's up to me
No one can say what we get to be
So why don't we rewrite the stars?
Maybe the world could be ours tonight

You think it's easy?
You think I don't want to run to you?
But there are mountains
And there are doors that we can't walk through
I know you're wonderin' why
Because we're able to be just you and me within these walls
But when we go outside
You're gonna wake up and see that it was hopeless after all
You might also like
No one can rewrite the stars
How can you say you'll be mine?
Everything keeps us apart
And I'm not the one you were meant to find
It's not up to you, it's not up to me
When everyone tells us what we can be
How can we rewrite the stars?
Say that the world can be ours tonight

All I want is to fly with you
All I want is to fall with you
So just give me all of you
It feels impossible
It's not impossible
Is it impossible?
Say that it's possible

How do we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine
Nothing can keep us apart
'Cause you are the one I was meant to find
It's up to you and it's up to me
No one can say what we get to be
Why don't we rewrite the stars?
Changin' the world to be ours
You know I want you
It's not a secret I try to hide

We're bound to break and my hands are tied93Embed","141 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsRewrite the Stars Lyrics
You know I want you
It's not a secret I try to hide
I know you want me
So don't keep sayin' our hands are tied
You claim it's not in the cards
And fate is pulling you miles away and out of reach from me
But you're here in my heart
So who can stop me if I decide that you're my destiny?

What if we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine?
Nothing could keep us apart
You'd be the one I was meant to find
It's up to you and it's up to me
No one can say what we get to be
So why don't we rewrite the stars?
Maybe the world could be ours tonight

You think it's easy?
You think I don't want to run to you?
But there are mountains
And there are doors that we can't walk through
I know you're wonderin' why
Because we're able to be just you and me within these walls
But when we go outside
You're gonna wake up and see that it was hopeless after all
You might also like
No one can rewrite the stars
How can you say you'll be mine?
Everything keeps us apart
And I'm not the one you were meant to find
It's not up to you, it's not up to me
When everyone tells us what we can be
How can we rewrite the stars?
Say that the world can be ours tonight

All I want is to fly with you
All I want is to fall with you
So just give me all of you
It feels impossible
It's not impossible
Is it impossible?
Say that it's possible

How do we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine
Nothing can keep us apart
'Cause you are the one I was meant to find
It's up to you and it's up to me
No one can say what we get to be
Why don't we rewrite the stars?
Changin' the world to be ours
You know I want you
It's not a secret I try to hide
But I can't have you

Uh
Yeah, yeah

When I was young, I fell in love
We used to hold hands, man, that was enough (Yeah)
Then we grew up, started to touch
Used to kiss underneath the light on the back of the bus (Yeah)
I know your daddy didn't like me much
And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one
Oh, every day, she found a way out of the window to sneak out late

She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know that we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah

We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me
You might also like
Seventeen, and we got a dream to have a family
A house, and everything in between
And then, oh, suddenly, we turned twenty-three
And now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously

When we’re out in a crowd laughing loud and nobody knows why
When we’re lost at a club getting drunk and you give me that smile
Going home in the back of a car and your hand touches mine
When we’re done making love and you look up and give me those eyes

'Cause all of the small things that you do
Are what remind me why I fell for you
And when we’re apart and I’m missing you
I close my eyes and all I see is you
And the small things you do


When you call me at night while you’re out getting high with your friends (Out with your friends)
Every ""hi"", every ""bye"", every ""I love you"" you’ve ever said (You've ever said)

Ku terpaksa jatuh bila penat diri

Lupa semua kata, rasa nyawa tercabut

I'm done hatin' myself for feelin'
I'm done cryin' myself awake
I gotta leave and start the healin'
But when you move like that, I just wanna stay

What have I become now?
Lookin' through your phone now
Oh now, love to you is just a game
Look what I have done now
Dialling up the numbers on you
I don't want my heart to break

Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
All that shame and all that danger
I'm hopin' that my love will keep you up tonight
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
All that fear and all that pressure
I'm hopin' that my love will keep you up tonight

Well you done done me in; you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
Now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my bestest
Nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find
Love, love, love, love
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing
We're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be

And I will nibble your ear

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
I guess what I be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

Hancur hati ini melihat semua gambar diri

Tertawa bersamaku, seperti dulu lagi
Walau hanya sebentar, Tuhan tolong kabulkanlah
Bukannya diri ini tak terima kenyataan

Segala cara telah kucoba
Agar aku bisa tanpa dirimu
Namun semua, berbeda
Sulitku menghapus kenangan bersamamu

When I'm alone, I look at photos and videos
With you that I have kept for a long time
It breaks my heart to see all the pictures of myself
Those who can't, I repeat

I want this moment, you are here
Laugh with me, like old times
Even if only for a moment, God please grant it
It's not that you don't accept reality
This heart just misses

I have tried every way
So that I can be without you
But all, different
It's hard for me to erase memories with you

Like a scene from a movie that every broken heart knows
We were walking on moonlight, and you pulled me close
Split second and you disappeared and then I was all alone

I woke up in tears, with you by my side
A breath of relief, and I've realised
No, we're not promised tomorrow

So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna hold you like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standin', I won't take you for granted
'Cause we'll never know when, when we'll run out of time
So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you (Lose you)
I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you

In the blink of an eye, just a whisper of smoke
You could lose everything, the truth is you never know
So I'll kiss you longer, babe (Hey), any chance that I get
I'll make the most of the minutes and love with no regret

Let's take our time to say what we want (Say what we want)
Use what we got before it's all gone (All gone)
'Cause no (No), we're not promised tomorrow

A broken heart is all that's left
I'm still fixing all the cracks
Lost a couple of pieces when
I carried it, carried it, carried it home
I'm afraid of all I am
My mind feels like a foreign land
Silence ringing inside my head
Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home

I've spent all of the love I saved
We were always a losing game
Small-town boy in a big arcade
I got addicted to a losing game

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game

How many pennies in the slot?
Giving us up didn't take a lot
I saw the end 'fore it begun
Still I carried, I carried, I carry on

I'm at a payphone, tryin' to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down

I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it ""Love""
But even the sun
Sets in paradise

I'm at a payphone, tryin' to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong

'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine (Oh-oh)
I don't expect you to care (Yeah)
I know I said it before
But all of our bridges burned down

I've wasted my nights

Man, fuck that shit
I'll be out spendin' all this money while you're sittin' 'round
Wondering why it wasn't you who came up from nothin'
Made it from the bottom, now when you see me, I'm stuntin'
And all of my cars start with the push of a button
Telling me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my shirt, you can tell that I'm ballin'
Swish, what a shame, coulda got picked
Had a really good game, but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could've saw, but sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled up, valet open doors
Wished I'd go away, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want
So you can go take that little piece of shit with you (Yeah)

(Two, three, four)

I was closing all the blinds
Just so you could sleep the night through
I was staying by your side
Just so I knew you were okay
And I was opening the door
Just to see if you would walk through
I started painting all the walls
Just to see if you liked the shade

I would love just to be stuck to your side
Not with anybody else, anybody else
It's enough just to keep us occupied
Please don't go
I would love just to be stuck to your side
Not with anybody else, anybody else (Don't go)
It's enough just to keep us occupied (Please don't go)

You were holding out your hands
Hoping I'd be there to hold to
I went out to Amsterdam
Just so I could givе you some space
But I kept opеning my door
Just to see if you would walk through

And that's when I caught me hopin' you'd stay a while (Stay a while)

Baby, I'd give up anything to travel inside your mind
Baby, I fall in love again come every summertime

Twenty-five, man we're missin' church
Laugh 'bout everyone we're hatin' at work
Dinner with your sister and the jokes kinda hurt
Cry the way home and you're puttin' me first, oh
Yeah, you just always know what to say

We're strolling down the boulevard, and dancing under streetlights (Oh, the lights)
Every year we get older and I'm still on your side (Oh, I)

Ah-ah, ah-ah (Ah-ah, ah-ah)

I spend my weekends tryna get you off
My mind again, but I can't make it stop
I'm tryna pretend I'm good, but you can tell (Good but you can tell)

You're right, I shoulda texted you goodnight
I shoulda given more time
I wish I hadn't known this before
Now I'm replayin' our goodbye
But it wasn't a goodbye
And I still hear you slammin' the door

Try to hit you up, but you've had enough
You're screamin' down the phone, ''You don't know what you lost'' (You don't know what you lost)
I said, ""I'm fine,"" I didn't care that much
But I realise when you hang up, I messed this up

I spend my weekends tryna get you off
My mind again, but I can't make it stop
I'm tryna pretend I'm good, but you can tell (Uh)

Guess you're finally realizin' how bad you messed it up
Girl, you're only makin'
Girl, you're only makin' it worse
When you call like you always do when you want someone

You took away a year
Of my fuckin' life
And I can't get it back no more
So when I see those tears
Comin' out your eyes
I hope it's me they're for

You didn't love when you had me
But now you need me so badly
You can't be serious (Ha-ha-ha)

After the things you put me through

Don't give your heart to a girl who's still got a broken one

You took away a year (Took away a year)

불꺼진 romantic all my life
내 주위는 온통 lovely day
내 눈 속에 비친 arrow sign
(Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why?)

I'm feeling lonely (Lonely)
그만 힐끗대고 말해줘요 hold me (Hold me)
다시 crying in my room
숨기고 싶어 (Say what you say, but I want it more)
But still I want it more, more, more

I gave a second chance to Cupid
널 믿은 내가 정말 stupid
보여줄게 숨겨왔던 love, is it real?
Cupid is so dumb

또 꿈길을 걷는 every day
눈 뜨면 다시 또 flew away
Waiting around is a waste (Waste)
나 솔직히 지금이 편해
상상만큼 짜릿한 걸까?

I don't see you
You're not in every window I look through
And I don't miss you
You're not in every single thing I do
I don't think we're meant to be
And you are not the missing piece
I won't hear it
Whenever anybody says your name
And I won't feel it
Even when I'm burstin' into flames
I don't regret the day I left
I don't believe that I was blessed
I'm probably lyin' to myself, again

I'm alone in my head
Looking for love in a stranger's bed
But I don't think I'll find it

And I gotta convince myself I don’t want it even though I do (Even though I do)

Yelling at the sky
Screaming at the world
Baby, why'd you go away?
I’m still your girl
Holding on too tight
Head up in the clouds
Heaven only knows where you are now

How do I love, how do I love again?
How do I trust, how do I trust again?

I stay up all night, tell myself I'm alright
Baby, you're just harder to see than most
I put the record on, wait ’til I hear our song
Every night, I'm dancing with your ghost
Every night, I'm dancing with your ghost

Never got the chance
To say your last goodbye
I gotta move on

I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?

I'm in Toronto and I got this view
But I might as well be in a hotel room, yeah

Spending all my nights reading texts from you

You know that I hate to admit it

Afraid of the big, wide world
She grew up within her castle walls
Now and then, she tried to run

So afraid, all alone

They've warned her, don't go there
There's creatures who are hidin' in the dark
Then somethin' came creepin'
It told her, ""Don't you worry, just

Follow everywhere I go

And you'll be safe under my control

Tak perlu dijual beli dengan duitmu
Tetapi (Kumahu, aku mahu)

Kau melayan aku selalu
Dengarlah hatiku
Dengan hati tulus kerna
I am not for sale

Rumah ini hanya dipenuhi dengan bunyi
Gema kasut Jimmy Choo kau beli untuk hari jadi
Yang bukan kau hantar pun sendiri
Kau selalu suruh kubawa Maserattimu
Beli belah dengan Mastercardmu

Jom pergi shoppingEmbed","4 Contributors Not For Sale Lyrics
Bell sounds
Stay excited while cooking
But it's empty when I find it
Another letter, with a gold chain from you
Prada, Gucci
Right in front of my eyes but I don't care
With anything you give days
Knock girls you can buy

Oh, me
(I don't want, I don't want)
Gem gold
(I don't want, I don't want)
Anything from you, my love
No need to buy and sell with your money
But (How, I want)
You by my side (How, I want)
You always treat me
Listen to my heart
With a sincere heart
I am not for sale

This house is just filled with noise
Echoes of the Jimmy Choo shoes you bought for your birthday
The one you didn't send yourself
You always tell me to bring your Maserati
Shop with your Mastercard
Did you know?
How about a girl you can buy?
You might also like
Oh, me
(I don't want, I don't want)
Gem gold
(I don't want, I don't want)
Anything from you, my love
No need to buy and sell with your money
But (How, I want)
You by my side (How, I want)
You always treat me
Listen to my heart
With a sincere heart
I am not for sale

If I have no wealth
(You look sideways)
If I don't drive
(You won't waste time)
So I give it all
If it is lost tomorrow, we will buy it again
She's curvy, I let her have her way
Hermes, like everyday's your birthday, hey
Margiela for mi bella
Let me sponsor his Isabell Marant
Bond for me (for me)
Muller, the all-in-one Sky-Dweller
GT or QP, Maserti
If wearing a hijab, there is a Cavalli scarf
Givenchy, Tisci, only for wives
If not for sale, why is it still here?
Oh, I don't want, I want
Gem gold
I want, I want
Anything from you, my love
No need to buy and sell with your money
But how, I want
You are by my side
How, I want
You always treat me
Listen to my heart
With a sincere heart
I am not for sale

(I want, I want)
(You really don't want all of this?)
Oh-oh-oh-oh (I want, I want)
(If you don't want it, you can return it and get a refund)
Oh-oh-oh-oh (How, how)
(But if you want to give it back, give it all back)
Oh-oh-oh-oh (How, how)
(No need to save)
