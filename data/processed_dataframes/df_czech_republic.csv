0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Viktor Sheen,Až na měsíc,"Až na měsíc Lyrics

Uvízl jsem nevím jak, pod září nočních lamp
Ve fontáně co jsem já, naplnil po okraj
Vzpomínek, jak jsem nám, bral lístek do oblak
Vzpomínek, jak jsem nám, hrál city na strunách
Nejsi ničí, páč nejsi má
Jestli uvidím někoho se dotýkat tě
Vyjdu z hlubin duše, kde je tma
Abych mohl toho zkurvysyna rozmrdat
Pár měsíců si olivy nedám
Páč co jsem navařil se špatně tráví
A směřuju z bytu přitom nevím kam
Z bytu kde jsi stihla vyměnit zámky
V tvejch očích
Snažím se číst
Vidím celej vesmír
Padá skaf a ne sníh
Nikdy jsme nebyli takhle deep
Nikdy jsme nebyli takhle high
Já a ty už to víš
Že už nikdy nemusím bejt sám

Jsme výš - pak níž - dál - blíž
Až na měsíc, až na měsíc
Jsme výš - pak níž - dál - pak blíž
Až na měsíc, až na měsíc

Já si tě nahrávám, nahrávám
Zabíráš mi místo v cloudu
Všechny ty drogy a cigára
O tobě mi řeknou pravdu
Tvý tělo na mě tančí
I v tý tmě tě najdu
Já jenom zpomalím, přidávám
Chci tvý číslo než odejdu
Ale já ještě nejdu pryč
Všechno to co můžu dostat u těch kurev, dej mi ty
Všechno co dělají mí lidi v noci jsou vzpomínky
Ve dvě ráno mi opilý holky koukají na rty
Černý oči a zlý návyky

Teď je otevřu já tobě
Jsme blíž, dál, níž, pak blíž, pojď blíž, sundej kříž
A přestaň se modlit dneska večer budem tančit
Dneska večer budem pít

Jde se mnou výš dokud to hraje
Děláme zlo, když slunce zajde
I v tý tmě se vždycky najdem
Pojď se mnou dál a nech to na mě
Všechny ty dny mi začínají splývat
Když si u mě blíž, a pak jsme

I'm stuck I don't know how, under the glow of night lamps
In the fountain that I am, filled to the brim
The memory of me taking a ticket to the clouds
The memory of how I played our feelings on the strings
You're nothing, you're not mine
If I see someone touching you
I will come out of the depths of the soul where there is darkness
So I can fuck the son of a bitch
I won't eat olives for a few months
What I cooked is difficult for him to digest
And I'm heading out of the apartment, but I don't know where
From the apartment where you managed to change the locks
In your eyes
I'm trying to read
I see the whole universe
It's raining, not snow
We've never been this deep
We've never been this high
You and I already know that
That I never have to be alone again

We are higher - then lower - further - closer
Up to a month, up to a month
We are higher - then lower - further - then closer
Up to a month, up to a month

I'm recording you, recording you
You're taking up my cloud space
All the drugs and the cigar
They will tell me the truth about you
Your body dances on me
Even in the dark I will find you
I just slow down, I add
I want your number before I leave
But I'm not going away yet
All that I can get from those whores, you give me
All my people do at night are memories
At two in the morning, drunk girls look at my lips
Black eyes and bad habits

Universe
He says we belong together he opened my eyes
Now I'll open them for you
We are closer, further, lower, then closer, come closer, take down the cross
And stop praying tonight I'm gonna dance
I'm going to drink tonight

It goes higher with me while it plays
We do evil when the sun goes down
Even in the dark I can always find myself
Come on with me and leave it to me
All those days are starting to blend into me
When you are closer to me, and then we are

Higher, then lower, further, closer

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around

For now, the day bleeds into nightfall

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around

For now, the day bleeds into nightfall

Jo, Viktore, já tě miluju prostě a jednou se vezmem
Poslouchám tě už od třinácti let a prostě vezmem se, já to vim
Takže I love you prostě, víš co, prostě my se jednou vezmem
Já to vim, já jsem tě viděla a my k sobě patříme prostě, tak se vezmem

Přijde mi, že zastavil se čas teď
Já v týhle pustině nebejvám často
Tady odsud už mi nejede nic zpátky nazpět
Všechno tohle beru s sebou na stage
Bitches na mě čuměj jako na steak
Líčej na mě pasti a všechny mají naspěch
A démoni mě berou s sebou chlastat
Chtějí mě vidět jak přijdu o všechno jak Max Paynе
A její fialový oči bolej
Ale dělám všеchno pro to, aby jsem odešel po svejch
Já posouvám jí hned na druhou kolej
Ale dělá všechno pro to, abych v hlavě viděl postel
A říkali, že milujou mou hudbu
Já vim, že nemusim je ani zkoušet
Já vidim clout chase píčo všude kam jdu
Já vim, že pes, co štěká, málo kouše
Lež má dlouhý rovný nohy a velký pevný kozy
Tak doufám, že máš pěkný auto, v kterym jí chceš vozit
Pak nabídne ti pussy jako sklenici vody
Ve který se utopíš, než probudíš se, přijdeš o byt (Anebo ne, já nevim)

Já nabírám speed, nejsem tu s ní
Moje hudba zní a ona tančí
Choděj všude za mnou jako mý stíny, já to vím
Stíny, já to vím
Tahle byla pro mě něco jako weed
Hrozně voní, ale nemůžu jí mít
A moje hudba zní, ona tančí
A za zádama se mi hejbou její stíny

Mám za sebou stíny, za sebou stíny
Mám za sebou stíny, stíny, já to vím
Stíny, já to vím
Yeah, woo

Jebat, Jesus mi zakázal s tebou mluvit
Já mám rozexpenej char a nechci začínat od nuly
Chci utýct, ale nevim kudy
Nevyznám se v tomhle klubu, ovládají mě mý pudy
Spíš pud sebezáchovy než se zmátořim
Jsou tři ráno, bitches tahaj frajery na záchody
My jsme dobrej tým, umíš rýsovat, já násobit
Vítej na mý party, tohle jsou mý příběhy a sny
Přitom chtěl bych jen sedět doma a hrát WoWko
Apex a Tarkov a rageovat u LoLka
Teď sedim v backstagi a je tu horko

Yes, Viktor, I just love you and I will get married one day
I've been listening to you since I was thirteen and I'm just gonna get married, I know
So I just love you, you know what, we'll just get married one day
I know, I've seen you and we just belong together, so I'll get married

It seems to me that time has stopped now
I don't come to this wasteland often
There's no turning back from here
I take all this with me on stage
Bitches stare at me like a steak
Throw traps at me and everyone's in a hurry
And the demons take me with them to drink
They want to see me lose everything like Max Payne
And her purple eyes hurt
But I'm doing everything to get away
I immediately move her to the second track
But he does everything to make me see the bed in my head
And they said they love my music
I know I don't even have to try them
I see clout chase cunt everywhere I go
I know that a dog that barks doesn't bite much
Lie has long straight legs and big firm tits
So I hope you have a nice car to drive her in
Then he offers you a pussy like a glass of water
In which you'll drown before you wake up, you'll lose your apartment (Or not, I don't know)

I'm picking up speed, I'm not here with her
My music plays and she dances
Follow me everywhere like my shadows, I know it
Shadows, I know
This one was like weed to me
It smells awful, but I can't have it
And my music plays, she dances
And behind me are her shadows

Shadows behind me, shadows behind me
I've got shadows, shadows, I know it
Shadows, I know
Yeah, woo

Fuck, Jesus forbade me to talk to you
I have an expanded char and I don't want to start from scratch
I want to run away, but I don't know where to go
I don't know anything about this club, my instincts rule me
More of a self-preservation instinct than I am
It's three in the morning, bitches, drag dudes to the bathroom
We are a good team, you can draw, I can multiply
Welcome to my party, these are my stories and dreams
Meanwhile, I'd just like to sit at home and play WoWko
Apex and Tarkov and raging at LoLka
Now I'm sitting in the backstage and it's hot

Vedle mě zvrací princezna, nastavím dlaň a požehnám
Pro všechny jasný poselství - tomu se říká přátelství
Mám tisíc otázek na žádnou vzpomínku
Skládám si obrázek kámen po kamínku
Včerejší produkce šla do bezvědomí
Nastává dedukce, co na to svědomí
A už si vzpomínám, já byl jsem na srazu
S kumpány který mám, patříme do svazu
Vlastníme doménu, tak si nás rozklikni

Z přímek se stávaj zatáčky, točí se svět, jsem na sračky
Vedle mě zvrací princezna, nastavím dlaň a požehnám
Pro všechny jasný poselství - tomu se říká přátelství
Stačí pár večírků, společně s bohémy
Za kterými se táhnou od školy problémy
V partě je Blekota, Jekota, Mekota
Dost často hovoříme o smyslu života
Jako je třeba teď, mám tisíc otázek
Na žádnou vzpomínku, si skládám obrázek
Z těžkejch ran lížu se, včera jsme slavili

I return home early in the morning, intoxicated with quality wine
Straight lines become curves, the world spins, I'm on shit
A princess vomits next to me, I raise my palm and bless
A clear message for everyone - this is called friendship
I have a thousand questions about no memory
I'm putting the picture together stone by stone
Yesterday's production went into unconsciousness
There is a deduction, what about the conscience
And I remember, I was at the meeting
My friends and I belong to a union
We own the domain, so click us
Union of Czech Bohemians...
I return home early in the morning, intoxicated with quality wine
Straight lines become curves, the world spins, I'm on shit
A princess vomits next to me, I raise my palm and bless
A clear message for everyone - this is called friendship
Just a few parties, together with bohemians
After which the problems from the school drag on
Blekota, Jekota, Mekota are in the group
We often talk about the meaning of life
Like right now, I have a thousand questions
For no memory, I'm putting together a picture
I'm licking my wounds, we celebrated yesterday
St. Vyšus
I return home early in the morning, intoxicated with quality wine
Straight lines become curves, the world spins, I'm on shit
A princess vomits next to me, I raise my palm and bless
A clear message for everyone - this is called friendship
The world is speeding up
The neighbor is baking cookies
The highest state of emergency has been reported

Representations of the Czechs to God
He goes out into the fields
Saber made of quality wine
Fight the system

Vidim jiný hvězdy na obloze, nevidíme sebe ani v odraze
Ona má oči utopený v dotazech, kde to jsme, yeah
My máme rozdělený světy – zeď, místo, z kterýho nemůžeš zpět
Řeknu ti poslední slova teď

What time is it where you are now?

Look at that smile, I know you haven't seen it in a long time
Demons have been controlling you for a long time, I know you're dying of desire, yeah
Look how my world looks like, everything runs slowly like slow-mo
She can stop time when she uses her power, she uses her power
I see other stars in the sky, we don't even see ourselves in the reflection
She has her eyes drowned in questions, where are we, yeah
We have divided worlds - a wall, a place from which you cannot return
I will tell you the last words now

We are worlds apart and I am dying in yours
Alcohol and cigarettes, mainly because I'm not alone today
We are worlds apart and I am dying in yours

We are worlds apart and I am dying in yours
Alcohol and cigarettes, mainly because I'm not alone today
Before we are divided by worlds and I die in yours
Alcohol and cigarettes, mainly because I'm not alone today

Yeah, yeah, and I have another world in front of me
My world looks like a wasteland
I already have a black and white dream
A ton of lejster written in front of you
My heart beats when the bassline goes
I'm slowly running out of time here
In your world, people run and hurry somewhere
In my world, people don't die, no
You want to see paradise - I'll show you paradise
I don't care about other worlds
What time is it here, I can't see a shadow here
I know, I decide what is real
It's normal to hate everything around you in the world you want to live in
I'll fuck your hate and get carried away
I see crop circles

Ahoj kotě, snad tě neruším
Promiň že volám, je tolik hodin

Nevěděl jsem, že to bude bolet
Nevěděl jsem, že jich bude tolik
Všude krev a já se bojím
Toho co přijde, odpusť mi
Asi nezvládnu zítra dojít

Volám tak pozdě večer
Sedím na záchodě v klubu
Kde bych měl mít zrovna teď show
Mám v sobě nějaký svinstvo
A cítím se fakt low
Chtěl bych ti dát jen sbohem
Když stane se něco se mnou
Asi žijem moc rychle, umíráme pomalu
Věř mi, že jsem ti nechtěl, posílat tyhlety zprávy
Dolij poslední číši, dej za mě pusu mámě

Daruj mi tvůj poslední výdech
Nebudu tu když se rozední

What comes, forgive me

I'm sitting on the toilet at the club
Where should I have a show right now?
I have some crap in me
And I feel really low
I just want to say goodbye
When something happens to me

Ooh, ooh

Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's truе, it's true

Utrhla trávu a začla hrát
Ta malá dáma z předměstí
Co umí lidem z dlaní číst
Tam kočky z rána mívaj hlad
Po noci plný neřestí
Je pohladí a dá jim jíst

Po tmě se toulá a ve dne spí
A její oči vědí víc než míň
Došly mi slova já stál tam jen
S touhle jedinou bych zemřel
S touhle bych zemřel v jedinej den
A jestli vám to nestačí
Kdyby tam stála stovka žen
Vyzvu jí k tanci a to netančím

Tam za tratí svý doupě má
Mince po kašnách posbírá
A pak je skládá na kolej
Staví si chrám plechovej most
Už po něm kráčí první host
Tak ať ho nohy nebolej

Prošla si peklem a kouzla zná
Přejetý mince počítá
A kdo jí spatří je zatracen
S touhle jedinou bych zemřel

She plucked the grass and began to play
The little lady from the suburbs
That he can read people's palms
Get hungry there, cats in the morning
After a night full of vices
He strokes them and lets them eat

It roams in the dark and sleeps during the day
And her eyes know more than less
I just stood there at a loss for words
I would die with this one
I would die with this one in a day
And if that's not enough for you
If there were a hundred women standing there
I ask her to dance and I don't dance

He has his lair there behind the track
He collects coins from fountains
And then he stacks them on the track
He is building himself a tin bridge temple
The first guest is already walking on it
So don't let his legs hurt

She's been through hell and she knows spells
Swiped coins count
And whoever sees her is damned
I would die with this one

I would die with this one in a day
And if that's not enough for you
If there were a hundred women standing there
I ask her to dance and I don't dance

And all I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach but I stand
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high waisted shorts, oh
She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no

'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love the taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside, it starts to pour
Comin' down

One love, one house

I open my eyes - I'm alone here, when I close - I see you
I'm smoking a blunt after a blunt, I'm smoking a blunt behind the wheel
I want to reach where the day ends, week after week goes by

Ukaž mi sebe, ukážu ti svět
Některý slova nejdou vrátit zpět
Oni chtěj fotky, chtějí kousek mě
Já sedím po show jako zbitej pes
Můj svět z ledu
Tolik bitches kolem, že se o tu cestu peru
Nech mě projít, neruš
Jdou za mnou celou dobu, co nahoru se deru
Ale jednu s sebou beru
A to co předvádí je umění
Proč ostatní jsou tolik umělý
A proč ze všech ostatních je ti zrovna u mě líp?
Kolik z nich toho tolik o mně ví
Mi přijde, že se okolo nás mění podnebí
Je první, poslední, znám jí a neznám jí
Hadry pod postelí a všechno je to ledový a ohnivý
V noci se budím s ní
Venku je déšť a já v srdci mám mráz
Řekni co chceš, dokud na to mám čas
Žiju pro tebe babe, žiju pro nás, všechno jenom pro nás, yeah
Venku je sníh oni v srdci maj zášť
A ty nosíš moji krev, baby v sobě ji máš
A všechno co dělám já
Všechno je to pro nás
Všechno je to pro nás, yeah

Můj stack je fat, je pro mou krev
Můj táta nebyl stopro, já jsem táta teď
Ukážu jí svět, dám jí svůj tep
Každej můj track, odevzdám jí dech, yeah
Řeknu jí, že nějaký věci nejdou vrátit zpět
Dostane dětství, který kdysi vzali mě
Budu milovat tvůj smích, milovat tvůj brek
Nejsem zlatý dítě, ale teďka žijem zlatej věk
Pátek, sobota běžím jak Flash
Udělat show, udělat nějakej cash, yeah
Odcházím první a ne poslední
Já řídím domů k ní

Show me yourself, I'll show you the world
Some words cannot be undone
They want photos, they want a piece of me
I sit after the show like a beaten dog
My world of ice
So many bitches around that I'm fighting for that way
Let me pass, don't disturb
They follow me the whole time I'm fighting upstairs
But I'm taking one with me
And what he performs is art
Why others are so artificial
And why do you feel better with me than everyone else?
How many of them know so much about me
It seems to me that the climate around us is changing
She is the first, the last, I know her and I don't know her
Rags under the bed and everything is icy and fiery
I wake up with her at night
It's raining outside and I'm cold in my heart
Say what you want while I have time
I live for you babe, I live for us, everything just for us, yeah
There is snow outside, they have a grudge in their hearts
And you carry my blood, baby you got it in you
And everything I do
It's all for us
It's all for us, yeah

My stack is fat, it's for my blood
My dad wasn't a stopro, I'm a dad now
I'll show her the world, I'll give her my pulse
Every track of mine, I give her my breath, yeah
I will tell her that some things cannot be undone
He will get the childhood that once took me
I'll love your laugh, love your cry
I'm not a golden child, but I'm living a golden age right now
Friday, Saturday I run like Flash
Make a show, make some cash, yeah
I'm the first to leave and not the last
I drive home to her

When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale

I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

At the curtain's call it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made

Don't wanna let you down, but I am hell-bound
Though this is all for you, don't wanna hide the truth
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

Put your loving hands out, baby
'Cause I'm beggin'

I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hands out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hands out, darlin'

Riding high when I was king
I played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything
I walked away, you won me then
But easy come and easy go and it would end
So anytime I bleed, you let me go
Yah, anytime I feed, you get me know
Anytime I seek, you let me know
But I planted that seed, just let me grow
I'm on my knees when I'm beggin'
'Cause I don't wanna lose you
Hey, yeah, ra-ta-ta-ta!

'Cause I'm beggin', beggin' you
Uh, put your loving hands out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you, ah
And put your loving hands out, darlin'

I need you to understand
Tried so hard to be your man
The kind of man you want in the end
Only then can I begin to live again

An empty shell, I used to be
The shadow of my life was hangin' over me
A broken man that I don't know
Won't even stand the devil's dance to win my soul
You might also like
What we doin'? What we chasin'?
Why the bottom? Why the basement?
Why we got good shit, don't embrace it?
Why the feel for the need to replace me?
You're the wrong way track from the good
I want to paint a picture tellin' where we could be at
Like a heart in the best way should
You can give it away, you had it and you took the pay
But I keep walkin' on, keep openin' doors
Keep hopin' for, now the door is yours
Keep also home
'Cause I don't want to live in a broken home, girl, I'm beggin'

Mmm, yeah-yeah, yeah, I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hands out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hands out, darlin'

I'm fighting hard to hold my own
Just can't make it all alone
I'm holding on, I can't fall back
I'm just a calm, 'bout to fade to black
I'm beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hands out, baby

Lately, I've been, I've been losin' sleep

Swing my heart across the line
And in my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and ye' shall find

Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told

I feel something so right doin' the wrong thing

Nepotřebuju toho moc
Jenom noc, jenom stage, jenom lidi, který nemaj nikdy dost
Nepotřebuju toho moc
Jenom mic, jenom bass, je to sick, ale žádná nemoc
Potřebuju klub, ať je úplně full
Narvanej od stage, až po vstup
Lidi, co řvou 'pull up' hned po tom, co začne choon
Crowd surfing asi si pořídím člun
Potřebuju drop, rare jako Supreme drop
V mým paláci jsem high i bez drog
Jen já a mý bros, on stage dám do lidí skok
Odmítám na to čekat další rok
Potřebuju klub, ať je úplně full
Narvanej od stage, až po vstup

Potřebuju drop, rare jako Supremе drop
V mým paláci jsem high i bez drog
Jen já a mý bros, on stagе dám do lidí skok
Odmítám na to čekat další rok

Na stagi můžu říct jenom ’napadat’
A klub spadne, zastav a pull up dát
Na stagi mam sound jako gun man
Jako batt batt batt, ratatat
Nátlak jak abrakadabra, nechtěj me nasrat, neser mě, nasrat
Kdybych byl rasta, řeknu wah di bloodclaat
Nikdo neni jako já, když dávam drum n' bass
Nemůžeš zastavit tape, nemůžeš zastavit desku
Nemůžeš zastavit rave, nemůžeš zastavit cestu, nemůžeš zastavit vzestup
Nemůžeš zastavit base, nemůžeš zastavit fresh zvuk
Nemůžeš zastavit hate, nemůžeš zastavit lásku, nemůžeš zastavit mě, nezastavíš Sko
Můj domov je space, není to Země, natož Česko
Který je zkurveně lame, proto jsem do země zakopal všecko
Oni můžou mít face, ale beze mě by to tu zdechlo
Tohle je oheň, fire, flame, nebo co to ze mě kurva vylezlo
Dej mi žezlo a korunu, jabko, křeslo, trůn, ne kdejaký křeslo
Jsem král, nejsem někdo, nadčasovej jako techno
To je A51 zvuk, chceš to zastavit, tak to zkus, pořád víc killuju tunes

Mě osobně děsej čísla jen, když mi volaj neznámý čísla
Skrytý čísla, fakt nechci zvedat ty čísla, nevolej
Cejtim fízla, jediný čísla, co mě zajímaj jsou mý bankovní čísla a zprávy
Všichni teď řešej zprávy, všechny teď děsej zprávy
Na netu zprávy, TV zprávy, poplašný zprávy, falešný zprávy, lékařský zprávy
Jestli něčemu nevěřim, tak jsou to zprávy, jdou těžko strávit
Nevěřim ani předpovědi počasí, jsem paranoidní, ale neni to z trávy
Jedu jak klacky v kýblu, MCs dostávaj bidu
MCs mlčej, když přijdu, dát jako já by nezvládli ani na speedu
Jedu easy, oni to tlačí na sílu
Swag level jako kdyby nakupovali hadry v Lidlu
Ale nechci bejt povrchní píčus, tak řikám jen, že jejich bars jsou na píču
Proto dostávaj na píču, možná by brali jako výhru, kdyby se těm politikům povedlo zavřít klub
A mohli by žít aspoň chvíli v míru a nemuseli by se jen bát, že přijdu
A svejma bars udělám do hlavy díru, IQ mínus

Uh, one two, yeah yeah yeah, okay

I don't need much
Only the night, only the stage, only the people you can never have enough of
I don't need much
Only mic, only bass, it's sick, but no disease
I need the club to be completely full
Crowded from the stage to the entrance
People yelling 'pull up' right after the choon starts
Crowd surfing I'll probably buy a boat
I need a drop, a rare like a Supreme drop
In my palace I'm high even without drugs
Just me and my bros, on stage I'll give people a jump
I refuse to wait another year for it
I need the club to be completely full
Crowded from the stage to the entrance
People yelling 'pull up' right after the choon starts
Crowd surfing I'll probably buy a boat
I need a drop, a rare like Supreme drop
In my palace I'm high even without drugs
Just me and my bros, on stage I'll give people a jump
I refuse to wait another year for it

All I can say about stagi is 'invade'
And the club falls, stop and give a pull up
I have a sound like a gun man on stage
Like batt batt batt, ratatat
Pressure like abracadabra, don't screw me, don't screw me, screw me
If i were a rasta i say wah di bloodclaat
Nobody's like me when I play drum n' bass
You can't stop the tape, you can't stop the record
You can't stop the rave, you can't stop the journey, you can't stop the rise
You can't stop the bass, you can't stop the fresh sound
You can't stop the hate, you can't stop the love, you can't stop me, you can't stop Sko
My home is space, it's not the Earth, let alone the Czech Republic
Which is fucking lame, that's why I buried everything in the ground
They may have faces, but without me it would die here
This is fire, fire, flame, or whatever the fuck came out of me
Give me a scepter and a crown, an apple, a chair, a throne, not just any chair
I'm a king, I'm not somebody, timeless like techno
That's A51 sound, you want to stop it, try it, I'm killing tunes more and more

Numbers, numbers, numbers, numbers, everyone do the numbers now
People pass scary numbers, how do those numbers go up
Personally, I'm only scared of numbers when unknown numbers call me
Hidden numbers, I really don't want to pick up those numbers, don't call
I'm sorry, the only numbers I care about are my bank numbers and messages
Everyone deal with the news now, everyone scare the news now
On the net news, TV news, alarm news, fake news, medical news
If I don't believe something, it's the news, it's hard to digest
I don't even trust the weather forecast, I'm paranoid, but it's not from the grass
I'm driving like sticks in a bucket, MCs get bida
MCs shut up when I come, they wouldn't be able to give like me even on speedo
I'm going easy, they're pushing it hard
Swag level as if they were buying rags in Lidl
But I don't want to be a shallow dick, so I'll just say that their bars suck
So fuck it, maybe they would take it as a win if those politicians managed to close the club
And they could at least live in peace for a while and not have to worry about me coming
And I'll put a hole in my head, IQ minus
Holes in the brain like when you vote for SPD, holes in the brain like in cheese
I need the club to be completely full
Crowded from the stage to the entrance
People yelling 'pull up' right after the choon starts
Crowd surfing I'll probably buy a boat
I need a drop, a rare like a Supreme drop
In my palace I'm high even without drugs
Just me and my bros, on stage I'll give people a jump
I refuse to wait another year for it
I need the club to be completely full
Crowded from the stage to the entrance
People yelling 'pull up' right after the choon starts
Crowd surfing I'll probably buy a boat
I need a drop, a rare like a Supreme drop
In my palace I'm high even without drugs
Just me and my bros, on stage I'll give people a jump

High, high hopes
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes
Mama said, fulfill the prophecy
Be something greater, go make a legacy
Manifest destiny, back in the days
We wanted everything, wanted everything
Mama said, burn your biographies
Rewrite your history, light up your wildest dreams
Museum victories, every day
We wanted everything, wanted everything

Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting

Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision

The stranger crusaders, ain't ever wannabes

Kytky z pumpy zachraňují, když umírám
Víš já

Já
Občas nevidím ty věci, co pojí nás
Slepě nevnímám a sám vidět odmítám
Všechny ty důvody proč ustavičně říkáš
… že se nám osudy prolínáj
A díky tobě vím, že svět není jen černobílá
Postupně učím se jak dělat věci správně
No taky vím, že bez tebe něco ve mně umírá
Proto tu stojím s kytkou, ty křičíš na mě
A já to posral, nesnáším, když musím s omluvou
Tak už tu zůstaň, těžko najdu nějakou podobnou
Radši mám tebe, než sebe vidět na kolenou
Pojď se mnou, společně najdem poklad za duhou
Všechno dává smysl pak když svítá
Ale už je pozdě na to mít rád
Kytky z pumpy zachraňují, když umírám
Víš já, bez tebe umírám
Víš já, bez tebe umírám
Víš já, bez tebe umírám
Víš já, bez tebe umírám
Víš já, bez tebe umírám

Často chovám se jak debil, když mě nevidíš
Divím se, že se mnou vydržíš
Bojím se, že ty hlasy stejně jednou uslyšíš
No kdybych řekl všechno, stejně mi neuvěříš
Já mám svý démony, co potřebujou anděla
Prosím tě, prosím tě, zatím ještě nemávej
Chováš se skoro jako bys na nás zapomněla
Nedělej, nedělej, že se teď už neznáme
Zatímco zavírám ty kostlivce do skříní
Sere mě, že se ti fakt furt něco nelíbí
A kvůli tobě snažím se i trochu žít líp
Nemůžu za to, že bez tebe z toho šílím
Nemůžu za to, že bez tebe z toho šílím

Všechno dává smysl pak když svítá
Ale už je pozdě na to mít rád

Everything makes sense when it dawns
But it's too late to like it
Pump flowers save when I'm dying
You know me

I
Sometimes I don't see the things that connect us
I do not perceive blindly and refuse to see myself
All the reasons you keep saying
... that our destinies are intertwined
And thanks to you, I know that the world is not just black and white
I am gradually learning how to do things correctly
Well, I also know that without you something inside me is dying
That's why I'm standing here with a flower, you're yelling at me
And I screwed up, I hate having to apologize
So stay here, it's hard to find anything like it
I'd rather see you than see myself on my knees
Come with me, together we will find the treasure over the rainbow
Everything makes sense when it dawns
But it's too late to like it
Pump flowers save when I'm dying
You know I'm dying without you
You know I'm dying without you
You know I'm dying without you
You know I'm dying without you
You know I'm dying without you

I often act like a moron when you can't see me
I'm surprised you can put up with me
I'm afraid you'll hear those voices one day anyway
Well, if I told you everything, you still wouldn't believe me
I have my demons that need an angel
Please, please, don't have one yet
You almost act like you forgot about us
Don't, don't pretend we don't know each other anymore
While I lock those skeletons in the cupboards
I'm sorry that you still don't like something
And because of you, I try to live a little better
It's not my fault that I'm going crazy without you
It's not my fault that I'm going crazy without you

Everything makes sense when it dawns
But it's too late to like it
Pump flowers save when I'm dying
You know I'm dying without you
You know I'm dying without you
You know I'm dying without you
You know I'm dying without you

Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal (It's so unreal)
Didn't look out below

Tryin' to hold on, didn't even know

Where my brother was, I covered him, where there was a fight, I got a kill there, yeah
You're asking me where I've been
Tell me where I'd be, same place, different movie, yeah
And baby, I've been through a lot
But everything I saw I have known for a long time

Put serum in my veins, serum in my veins
We have many lives, but each one is a movie
Put the serum in my veins so I don't see where I've been
Let me wake up and find that I've been dreaming all along
Put serum in my veins, serum in my veins
We have many lives, but each one is a movie
Put the serum in my veins so I don't see where I've been
Let me wake up and find that I've been dreaming all along

I'm not with whores, I'm coming after you
There are flames everywhere I look
I will then be where the stories take me
I play that shit like Marigold on my lute
We thought I'd just take a look
Then the brother disappears from the club somewhere in handcuffs
My brother is swinging by his neck in a tree
And I don't want to see any more of these puppets
Take me away already, I don't want to be here
Your buddy is a snitch and your bitch is insane
It can't come off, I have to go all the way
Blood starts raining here and I feel like Blade

Zrovna jí to najelo, celý město mlčelo
Zrovna jí to najelo, dneska bude veselo

Ty dny jsou vobčas tak zkurveně dlouhý
Ale já mám řešení, a to jsou longy
Ty dny jsou vobčas tak zkurveně krátký
Já a můj squad jsme moc, my milujeme pátky
A taky soboty a vobčas neděle
V pondělí si říkám kurva, do prdele
Sedíme v Bukáči a kurvy píšou DMs
Nemam, co dělat, takže dělám vo tom píseň
Ty jsi princezna, a tak roztomile blbá
Jestli fakt chceš někoho z nás dvou mrdat
Aha, aha, aha, takže voba, haha
A pak komu z nás dvou mrdá
Já a Labello, dneska bude veselo
Venku zrovna pršelo, celý město mlčelo
Zrovna jí to najelo, celý město mlčelo
Zrovna jí to najelo, dneska bude veselo

Dneska pěkně pršelo, takže už jsem zlitej
Shánim kurvu na IG, zvu jí domů na tape
Bulhar jede už domů, už je zase vyplej
Já jsem taky hodně v píči, sotva vidim displej
Půlec nechci, chci jen půlky, lásku v 5 už neseženeš
Zkoušim ty, co nezkusil bych kdybych nebyl zlitej dement
Půjdem ke mně pustíme si Prima Love a Prima Cool
Vim, že nechceš sama domů, groupies have feelings, too

Já a CA$HANOVA, ona chtěla oba
Kámen, nůžky, papír o to, kdo dá góla
Kámen, nůžky, papír, ona u mě doma
Možná je to gól, ale né gól kola

It was just raining outside, the whole city was silent
It just hit her, the whole town was silent
She just got it, today is going to be fun

The days are so fucking long sometimes
But I have a solution, and that is longs
The days are so fucking short sometimes
Me and my squad are a lot, we love Fridays
And also Saturdays and sometimes Sundays
On Monday, I'm like, fuck, fuck it
We are sitting in Bukáč and whores are writing DMs
I have nothing to do, so I make a song about it
You are a princess and so cutely silly
If you really want to fuck either of us
Aha, aha, aha, so voba, haha
And then which of the two of us does he fuck?

It just hit her, the whole town was silent
She just got it, today is going to be fun

It rained a lot today, so I'm already wet
I'm looking for a hooker on IG, I'm inviting her home for a tap
The Bulgarian is already going home, he is already hungry again
I'm also in a lot of pain, I can barely see the display
I don't want half, I only want halves, you can't find love at 5 anymore
I try the ones I wouldn't try if I wasn't a complete demented person
I'll go to my place and we'll play Prima Love and Prima Cool
I know you don't want to go home alone, groupies have feelings, too

Slzy v očích, v hlavě kolotoč
Ptá se co, jak, kdy a proč
Zlomený srdce, já nepřál si to
Ani neplánoval jsem to
Věř mi, že já zkoušel jsem to
Ale zlomenej jsem hluboko uvnitř, 13. komnata –⁠ zamknuto
Hej, malá biš, líbíš se mi moc, ale nepustim tě blíž
Chtěla by jsi otevřít, ale nemáš klíč
Chtěla by jsi otevřít, ale nemáš klíč
Hej, malá biš, jsi tak hrozně hot, ale nerozpustíš
Zamrzlý mý srdce jako Mr. Freeze
Zamrzlý mý srdce jako Mr. Freeze

Pod vlivem posílá zprávy –⁠ doručeno, přečteno
Nevim, co napsat zpět
Vim, že stačilo by pár slov, pár, pár, pár, pár vět
Ale neumim lhát, ne, ne
Jsem upřímnej a jí bolí to
Snad jednou dostane rozum, pochopí to
A když ne, tak zůstanu sám, nemám s tim problém
Protože žít život bez žen je zen, zen
Milion+ je bratrstvo, Milion gang gang
A pussy si koupim, když jinak to nepůjde, jinak to nejde
Sejde z očí, sejde z mysli a není to vždycky tak easy
Že už mě nechceš vidět chápu
Ale kdyby jsi chtěla, tak klidně to dám
Nečekej ode mě nic víc než sex
Když budeš chtít, můžeš zůstat do rána
Nezměnilo se nic od posledně, dávno je konec mezi náma

Tears in the eyes, a carousel in the head
It asks what, how, when and why
Heartbroken, I didn't wish for it
I didn't even plan it
Trust me I've tried it
But I'm broken deep inside, 13th chamber - locked
Hey, you little bitch, I like you a lot, but I won't let you near me
You would like to open it, but you don't have the key
You would like to open it, but you don't have the key
Hey, you little bitch, you're so hot, but you won't melt
Frozen My Heart as Mr. Freeze

Under the influence sends messages -⁠ delivered, read
I don't know what to write back
I know that a few words, a few, a few, a few, a few sentences would be enough
But I can't lie, no, no
I'm honest and it hurts her
Maybe one day he'll come to his senses, he'll understand
And if not, I'll stay alone, I don't have a problem with that
Because living life without women is zen, zen
Milion+ is a brotherhood, Milion gang gang
And I'll buy a pussy if there's no other way, there's no other way
Out of sight, out of mind, and it's not always that easy
I understand that you don't want to see me anymore
But if you wanted, I'll give it to you
Don't expect anything more from me than sex
You can stay until morning if you want

U sebe nemám a možná kecám, fízlovi nikdy já nezazpívám
Nezajímá mě barva tvý kůže, ani more jestli si vegan

Co řeknu platí já svý slovo nikdy nerůším né
Můj rap syrovej jako sushi jé
Kámoši furt seděj kdy už je pustíte?!
Seru na slávu i čísla, vyrážim hledat zas Krajní Význam
Doma jsem tam, kde jsou mý lidi, není to místo
A jestli ti mý texty nedávaj smysl, to chápu

(Decky Beats)

Since morning, shots shots I've been fucked up
Grass that cuts you like Baghdad
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, I drive like an RX-7 more Mazda
G-Shock on my hand, more bust down
So much ganja it gave me asthma
Ha, ha, ha, (what?) I laugh every time I go to the bank
Whatever I say are facts, whatever I say is true
I'm Ice Kilimanjaro, earning cash is fun
Milion Plus my favorite number, Krtek Money Life the whole bunch
It's a gang, it's a mandom, above, full moon, sea, where do I go?
We'll meet outside, on the corner, on the corner by the convenience store
A flow original like Rocky or Kendrick or Bendig
I dreamed of a Bentley, but now it's better than having two
Cash, watch how the young man can spin it
Cash, before it was all low budget
Baller, I'll be right now look
Classy, ​​she never knew I would be this good
I'm okay, I'm everywhere, but secretly I'm more lowkey
I smell smoke from the joint, the boot is good, it twists well
Cheers, may health serve
Cheers, let's not have an emergency
Cheers, only god can judge
It's easy to get lost

I grate, grate sejr it's gouda
By cash I mean money, you moolah
All I have is my word and balls
You should have kept the rat and let Kodak out
I'm Hitman Tommy Monaghan
I have a bandana on my face and no gun
I don't have it with me and maybe I'm bullshitting, I'll never sing to a fool
I don't care about the color of your skin or if you're vegan
I guess I'm from another world
I want ""Back to my planet"", I can't wait
I will open the door to Moria, Mellon
The only thing I'm after is Melange
I drive 24 hours straight like Le Mans
In rap, I'm a cross between Norris and Seagal (Pow)

Life is like a movie, it's Bad or Boujee
I smoke like an Uzi, don't sell your soul
What I say is true, I never break my word, right?
Eat my rap raw like sushi
Sit down guys, when are you going to release them?!
Fuck the fame and the numbers, I'm off to find the ultimate meaning again
Home is where my people are, not a place
And if my lyrics don't make sense to you, I understand
You didn't experience anything, you weren't there with us

Nonstop jsem high, dojedem k vám
Řekni, kotě, kde, řekni, kotě, kolik nás jít má
Řekni co s sebou vzít, páč moje kapsa je plná zla

Nonstop high, Burberry shine
Head v koupelně, když se nikdo nedívá
Nonstop high, tak nebuď shy
Učím ji v noci řídit, sto padesát, GTA
Jsem nonstop high
Peníze do domu a útrata na dům
Jedu do Prahy za penězma a na booze
Nebudu se fotit, teďka nepracuju
Asian chick, fat ass a zábava na zimu
Jestli jsi nezvládla naskočit, tak já zpomalím vůz
V jednom městě někdo cizí, přitom čím dál menší kruh
U letiště AirBnb, klidně řekni někomu
Mám rád svůj klid, ale rád dojedu
Slyšel jsem jejich věci a pro mě je to výsměch
Sedím ve studiu tak dlouho, že to nedopíšu
Od šesti do šesti každej den, přesnej jako G-Shock
Nemluvím o ničem jiným, jsem totiž Popstar, píčo

Nonstop high, Burberry shine
Head v koupelně, když se nikdo nedívá
Nonstop high, tak nebuď shy

Nonstop high, Burberry shine
Head v koupelně, když se nikdo nedívá
Nonstop high, tak nebuď shy
Učím ji v noci řídit, sto padesát, GTA
Jsem nonstop high

Nevím, jestli koukám na GTA RP nebo je to real life
Nevím, jestli na mě ty holky koukaj jen tak nebo jestli mě znaj
Jsou nonstop high, Burberry shine, na krku její dlaň
Burberry šála, Burberry šála
Myslel jsem to jinak, když jsem říkal: „Umím dávat“
Ale jebat na to, klidně buď tu s náma
Já to stejně leavnu, ráno musím vstávat
Zejtra ráno mě na Kladně čeká káva (od mojí babe)
Dospělí jsme, nemusím schovávat se
Nebo se bát, že do pokoje přijde máma
Jsi nejvíc hot, od doby co jsi máma
Koupím další diamanty, ať jich nemáš málo

Say, baby, where, say, baby, how many of us have to go
Tell me what to take with me, because my pocket is full of evil

Non-stop high, Burberry shine
Head in the bathroom when no one is looking
Nonstop high, so don't be shy
I teach her to drive at night, one hundred and fifty, GTA
I'm non-stop high
Money for the house and spending on the house
I'm going to Prague for money and booze
I won't take pictures, I'm not working right now
Asian chick, fat ass and winter fun
If you didn't manage to jump, I'll slow the car down
A stranger in one city, at the same time a smaller and smaller circle
At the AirBnb airport, feel free to tell someone
I like my peace, but I like to finish
I've heard their stuff and it's a travesty to me
I've been sitting in the studio for so long that I can't write it
From six to six every day, as precise as a G-Shock
I'm not talking about anything else, I'm a Popstar, cunt

I don't know if the girls are just looking at me or if they know me
They are nonstop high, Burberry shine, her palm on the neck
Burberry scarf, Burberry scarf
I meant it differently when I said ""I can give""
But fuck it, just be here with us
I'll leave anyway, I have to get up in the morning
Coffee awaits me in Kladno tomorrow morning (from my babe)
We're adults, I don't need to hide

Thought I found a way
Thought I found a way out (Found)
But you never go away (Never go away)
So I guess I gotta stay now

Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear
Isn't it lovely, all alone?
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home

Walking out of time
Looking for a better place (Looking for a better place)
Something's on my mind
Always in my head space

But I know someday I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near

Celý den tvý chyby hledám
A večer se mi líbíš právě tím
Co mě normálně ze židle zvedá
Nakonec na zadek mě posadí
Někdy mám pocit, že žít se s tebou nedá
Třeba, když míváš nálady
Když je to nahoru a dolů
Mám chuť se sbalit
A odejít
A i když přesto všechno tě mám rád
Občas tě zapomenu milovat
Občas na tebe zapomenu
A i když přesto všechno tě mám rád
Občas tě zapomenu milovat
Občas na tebe zapomenu
Vím, každý máme svoje chyby
Záleží, na tom
Kdo a jak je vidí
Některý ty tvoje se mi zatraceně líbí
Nakonec jsou chyby to, co z lidí dělá lidi

Děkuju ti, že se tolik snažíš
Dáváš si další barvy na vlasy
Mně sе asi nejvíc líbí
Když ráno vstáváš
A jsi jaká jsi
A jsi jaká jsi

A i když přesto všechno tě mám rád
Občas tě zapomеnu milovat
Občas na tebe zapomenu
A i když přesto všechno tě mám rád
Občas tě zapomenu milovat
Občas na tebe zapomenu
Vím, každý máme svoje chyby

I've been looking for your mistakes all day
And that's exactly what I like about you in the evening
Which normally gets me out of my chair
Finally he puts me on my ass
Sometimes I feel like I can't live with you
Like when you're in the mood
When it's up and down
I feel like packing
And leave
And even though I love you all the same
Sometimes I forget to love you
Sometimes I forget you
And even though I love you all the same
Sometimes I forget to love you
Sometimes I forget you
I know we all have our faults
Depends on
Who sees them and how
I really like some of yours
Ultimately, mistakes are what make people human

Thank you for trying so hard
You dye your hair more
I probably like it the most
When you wake up in the morning
And you are what you are
And you are what you are

And even though I love you all the same
Sometimes I forget to love you
Sometimes I forget you
And even though I love you all the same

I stack it in my mind, and I'm waitin' for the time
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic

Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us (Ha)

Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y (Look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy-y-y-y-y (Look, look, look, look; yeah)
(Look out for yourself)
Uh, look, okay

I'm hopin' that somebody pray for me
I'm prayin' that somebody hope for me
I'm stayin' where nobody 'posed to be p-p-posted
Being a wreck of emotions
Ready to go whenever, just let me know
The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable
I'ma tell 'em, ""Hasta luego""
They wanna plot on my trot to the top
I been outta shape, thinkin' out the box, I'm an astronaut
I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe
And it matters more because I had it not
Had I thought about wreaking havoc
On an opposition, kinda shockin' they wanted static
With precision, I'm automatic quarterback
I ain't talkin' sackin', pack it
Pack it up, I don't panic, batter-batter up
Who the baddest? It don't matter 'cause we at your throat

Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy (Ah)
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Oh, the misery (Ah)
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy (Ah)
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Pray it away, I swear I'll never be a saint, no way
My enemy
Pray it away, I swear I'll never be a saint

When I was a young boy living in the city
All I did was run, run, run, run, run
Staring at the lights, they look so pretty
Mama said ""Son, son, son, son, son
You're gonna grow up, you're gonna get old
All that glitters don't turn to gold
But until then just have your fun
Boy, run, run, run, run, run""

Yeah, run, run, run
Run, run, run
When I was a young kid living in the city
All I did was pay, pay, pay, pay, pay
And every single dime that good Lord gave me
I could make it last three, four, five days
Living it up but living down low
Chasing that luck before I get old
And looking back, oh, we had some fun
Boy, run, run, run, run, run

They tell you that the sky might fall
They'll say that you might lose it all
So I run until I hit that wall
Yeah, I learned my lesson, count my blessings
Look to the rising sun and run, run, run
Yeah, one day well the sky might fall
Yеah, one day I could lose it all
So I run until I hit that wall
If I learnеd one lesson, count your blessings
Look to the rising sun and run, run, run

Run, run, run

Didn't get everything that I wanted
But I got what I need, yeah, yeah
I see that light in the morning
Shining down on me
So take me up high, take me down low
Where it all ends nobody knows
But until then let's have some fun

Říkám jí kotě jsem rodinnej typ, na prvním místě je crew, ne ty
Na prvním místě je clique, loajalita v mý krvi, nemůžu zradit
Asi jsem rodinnej typ (Yeah, Haarp on the beat)
Asi jsem rodinnej typ

Když odešel fotr, tak jediný co jsem chtěl bylo že ulehčit mámě
Naposledy jsem ho viděl u soudu, říkám mu alimenty si nech
Nepotřebuju tě, táhni, sám to zvládnu, cca osm let zpátky
Od tý doby o něm nevim ani nemám zájem
Neznáš, nebyls, nemůžeš vědět, nechápeš
Málokdo tě fakt podržet dokáže
Kde nebyli rodiče, starali jsmе se o sebe navzájеm
Zvedněte ruce, kdo to taky znáte
Vim to, že neni vás málo
Cash před kurvama a bros před prachama, amen
A jsem rodinnej typ jak Addams
A jsem rodinnej typ jak Frost
Věci, co říkám, jsou fakta, pravda
Věci, co říkám, tak dělají tlak
Mám husí kůži, když mluvim o tom
Mám husí kůži, když ve svojí hlavě já vracim se tam
Neni to easy, bratan
Ale nikdo neříkal, že jednoduchý to bude, nebo jo?
Lidi odpadávaj postupně, každej rok zůstávaj jenom ty pravý
Jsem zvědavej, kolik nás zůstane zejtra
Kdo zůstane i když skončí mejdan
Kdo zůstane i když dojde sejra
Dostal jsem facky od dědy, když mě domů dovezly švestky
V životě jsem se nestyděl jak tehdy
Roky na bytě s bratránkem, kterej hrál bedny
V pět ráno 50 000 a v 5:10 zase na nule je extrém
Bydleli jsme v jednom pokoji ve třech a se psem
Víš kolik lidí bydlelo u mě doma?
Za kolik lidí jsem zaplatil nájem?
Za kolik lidí jsem řešil problémy?
Nastavili mi pak záda, zrada bolí nejvíc od kamaráda
Zrada bolí nejvíc od kamaráda
A nejlíp, když ti píchá holku, taky to znám, mojí ex
Nech si zbytky, nedojídám
Stejně jsem rodinnej typ jako Peter Griffin
Rodinnej typ jako Family Guy
Milion+, Krtek forever
Říkám jí kotě jsem rodinnej typ, na prvním místě je crew, ne ty
Na prvním místě je clique, loajalita v mý krvi, nemůžu zradit
Asi jsem rodinnej typ

I tell her babe, I'm a family guy, the crew comes first, not you
The clique comes first, loyalty is in my blood, I can't betray
I guess I'm a family type (Yeah, Haarp on the beat)
I guess I'm a family type

When the photographer left, all I wanted to do was make it easier for my mom
Last time I saw him in court, I tell him to keep the alimony
I don't need you, go ahead, I can do it myself, about eight years ago
I haven't seen or cared for him since
You don't know, you haven't been, you can't know, you don't understand
Few people can really hold you
When our parents weren't around, we took care of each other
Raise your hands who knows it too
I know that there are not enough of you
Cash before whores and bros before money, amen
And I'm an Addams family type
And I'm a family type like Frost
The things I say are facts, the truth
The things I say put pressure
I get goosebumps just talking about it
I get goosebumps when I go back there in my head
It's not easy, bro
But nobody said it would be easy, did they?
People fall away gradually, each year only the right ones remain
I wonder how many of us will be left tomorrow
Who stays even when the party is over
Who will stay even when sejra ends
I got slapped by my grandfather when plums were brought home
I have never been as ashamed in my life as I was then
Years in an apartment with a cousin who played boxes
50,000 at five in the morning and zero again at 5:10 is extreme
We lived in one room, three of us and a dog
Do you know how many people lived at my house?
How many people did I pay rent for?
How many people have I solved problems for?
Then they set my back, betrayal hurts the most from a friend
Betrayal hurts the most from a friend
And it's best when a girl fucks you, I know it too, my ex
Keep the leftovers, I don't eat
I'm a family guy just like Peter Griffin
Family type like Family Guy
Million+, Mole forever
I tell her babe, I'm a family guy, the crew comes first, not you
The clique comes first, loyalty is in my blood, I can't betray
I guess I'm a family type

I tell her babe, I'm a family guy, the crew comes first, not you
The clique comes first, loyalty is in my blood, I can't betray

I tell her babe, I'm a family guy, the crew comes first, not you

73,73,73,73,73,73,73,Eminem,Till I Collapse,"TranslationsEspañolTürkçePortuguêsItalianoहिन्दीFrançais’Till I Collapse Lyrics
'Cause sometimes you just feel tired
Yo, left, yo, left
Feel weak and when you feel weak
Yo, left, right, left
You feel like you wanna just give up
Yo, left, yo left
But you gotta search within you
Yo, left, right, left
Try to find that inner strength and just pull that shit out of you
Yo, left, yo left
And get that motivation to not give up
Yo, left, right, left
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad
Yo, left, yo left
You wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse
Yo, left, right, left
'Til I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
‘Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fa' shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
Until my legs, until my legs
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me
You might also like
Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes: Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
André from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney — Nate, hit me!
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
Until my legs, until my legs
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me
Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
‘Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
‘Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
Until my legs, until my legs
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me

Until the roof, until the roof
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
Until my legs, until my legs
Give out from underneath me
I, I will not fall, I will stand tall
Feels like no one can beat me543Embed","TranslationsEspañolTürkçePortuguêsItalianoहिन्दीFrançais’Till I Collapse Lyrics

‘Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
Until my legs, until my legs
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me

Until the roof, until the roof
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
Until my legs, until my legs
Give out from underneath me
I, I will not fall, I will stand tall
Feels like no one can beat me543Embed",en,"{'served', 'bobby', 'rip', 'feelin', 'half', 'smoke', 'wizzle', 'word', 'hate', 'platinum', 'order', 'earth', 'perhaps', 'pop', 'forever', 'jada', 'underneath', 'outkast', 'static', 'though', 'prop', 'around', 'verse', 'forth', 'may', 'act', 'rapper', 'hit', 'battlin', 'stand', 'real', 'ima', 'reggie', 'absurd', 'back', 'sporadic', 'probly', 'mouth', 'start', 'nothin', 'attack', 'tall', 'slim', 'smart', 'lot', 'certain', 'single', 'reserved', 'addict', 'hold', 'clever', 'roof', 'whitney', 'jayz', 'collapse', 'fullblown', 'bizzles', 'people', 'envy', 'mathers', 'worse', 'matter', 'leg', 'status', 'soon', 'leave', 'shit', 'problem', 'first', 'shut', 'offend', 'botherin', 'doe', 'kurupt', 'hang', 'walk', 'forgot', 'high', 'eat', 'spot', 'plot', 'magic', 'baddest', 'sit', 'kim', 'track', 'slizzle', 'fall', '2pac', 'heart', 'wet', 'fizzin', 'beat', 'fuck', 'admit', 'rather', 'spend', 'plaque', 'try', 'biggie', 'rap', 'dream', 'launchin', 'andré', 'list', 'fuckin', 'nate', 'smack', 'shock', 'battle', 'miracle', '‘cause', 'fact', 'run', 'wack', 'bone', 'music', 'thinking', 'together', 'minute', 'press', 'wit', 'listen', 'end', 'clear', 'deserve', 'moment', 'til', 'constant', 'death', 'thought', 'light', 'product', 'addicted', 'spit', 'industry', 'shizzle', 'respect', 'bomb'}"

Skylark
Have you anything to say to me
Won't you tell me where my love can be
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed
Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring
Where my heart can go ajourneying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom-covered lane
And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night
It's wonderful music
Faint as the will of the wisp
Crazy as a loon
Sad as a gypsy serenading the moon
Oh, skylark
I don't know if you can find thesе things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So, if you see them anywherе
Won't you lead me there
And in your lonely flight

Ayy, ayy

I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (Star, ayy, ayy)
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta ('Sta)
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, them the shottas ('Tas)
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grrra-ta-ta-ta (Ta, pow, pow, pow, ayy, ayy)
Switch my whip, came back in black
I'm startin' sayin', ""Rest in peace to Bon Scott"" (Scott, ayy)
Close that door, we blowin' smoke
She ask me light a fire like I'm Morrison ('Son, ayy)
Act a fool on stage
Prolly leave my fuckin' show in a cop car (Car, ayy)
Shit was legendary
Threw a TV out the window of the Montage
Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn
Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryna get in
Sayin', ""I'm with the band"" (Ayy, ayy)
Now she actin' outta pocket, tryna grab up on my pants
Hundred bitches in my trailer say they ain't got a man
And they all brought a friend (Yeah, ayy, ayy, ayy)

I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (Star, ayy, ayy)

They like, ""Savage, why you got a 12 car garage

If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride

Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time

You want me, I want you, baby

I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars

No samozřejmě, že jsou můj jedinej argument, protože to je jediná věc, co snad potřebujem, ne?
Jsi ji rozbrečel
No jasně, já jsem jí rozbrečel, nazdar
Teď vypadnu z domu pryč, všechno dám z hlavy teď do hudby
Já musim zažít ty příběhy, abysme měli co do huby
Hodiny letěj jak holubi, řetězy cinkaj jak koruny
Já už tam dolů fakt nepůjdu a nemyslim si, že chceš dolů ty
Tak co po mně chceš, proč? Co po mně chceš, proč?
Máme život jako kolotoč, z něj nemyslim si, že jsi chtěla pryč
Jenom usmívej se a toč, jenom usmívej se a toč
Nechej mě vydělat valuty, nech mě teď odletět na jiný planety
Já dělám rap shit, to je moje práce
Musim se zlepšit, to je moje práce
A vydělaný love mám v píči, víš to, můžem je utrácet
Jenom mě nech teď dejchat v dálce, to je moje práce

Where are you going?
I have work
You keep going away
What are you talking about, I'm still with you, how can I be gone?
You're still screwed somewhere
What? Please, what are you talking about, I'm still locked up at home, so tell me where should I work?
Well, what do you think
How do I mean? I guess, so who will earn the money, tell me how?
This is your only argument
Well, of course they're my only argument, because that's the only thing I need, right?
You made her cry
Well, of course, I made her cry, bye
I'll get out of the house now, I'll put everything out of my head into the music now
I have to experience those stories so we can talk
Clocks fly like doves, chains jingle like crowns
I'm not really going down there anymore and I don't think you want to go down there
So what do you want from me, why? What do you want from me, why?
Our life is like a merry-go-round, I don't think you wanted to leave it
Just smile and spin, just smile and spin
Let me earn currency, let me fly to another planet now
I do rap shit, that's my job
I have to improve, that's my job
And I've got the love I've earned in my pussy, you know, I can spend it
Just leave me far away now, that's my job

Now you're saying, slow it down, not right now
Then ya wink at me and walk away

Touching and teasing me, telling me no

Ya actin' like a diva, sayin' you don't wanna pay
It's gotta be ya feisty style, raised eyebrow
I love it when you look at me that way
Now we're in, you order a mojito at the bar
You re-apply lippy 'cause it came off on the glass
The DJ plays your favorite songs, Kanye's on
Now ya beckoning for me to dance

But look at where I ended up

Hurt me with the word ""goodbye""?

Na ruce číslo, v duši čisto
Hledám místo, není tu pro mě místo
Držím si rány zatímco držíš pistol
Jsme k sobě zády, zamčeli jsme místnost
Na ruce číslo a v duši čisto
Hledám místo, není tu pro mě místo
Držím si rány zatímco držíš pistol
Jsme k sobě zády, zamčeli jsme místnost
Kdo je šašek? Kdo je král?
Kdo je pes? Kdo je pán?
Odpověď na toto mám, do hrobu si vemu sám sebe
Znám tě minutu udělal bych z tebe pár meme
Mluviti stříbro, mlčeti zlato
Ještě slovo, hledáš zuby, to máš za to
Za zuby, za zuby, za zuby, za zuby
Doporučuju ti držet jazyk za zuby
Nepomůže můj pohled, pomůže ti kokot do huby

O-oh
Tohle bude bolet, už to vim
V jedné ruce tonic, v druhé gin
Všude tolik voleb, tolik čísel, tolik bolesti, co píšеm
Tolik bolesti, co žijem
Asi jsi to měla bejt ty
Kdo mě vytáhnе z těch hoven, co si dělám
A asi jsi to měla bejt ty, ale spíš jsi tady měla bejt včera

Na ruce číslo, v duši čisto
Hledám místo, není tu pro mě místo
Držím si rány zatímco držíš pistol
Jsme k sobě zády, zamčeli jsme místnost

A pálíme mosty, sereme instagram, sereme posty

V tichosti, nelze popsat tyhle skvosty

A když jde o brat, klidně budu kat
Polykám v noci sto a přes den sto zvedám
Tvůj life je trochu vtip, můj zas HESOYAM
Až umřu, tak mí bratři prodejte všechny dema
Kde je moje země zaslíbená?
Kde jsou ty potoky plný medu?

Slibovalas hody, zatím hodně ledu

Number on the hand, clean in the soul
I'm looking for a place, there's no place for me
I hold my wounds while you hold the gun
We have our backs to each other, we locked the room
Number on the hand and clean in the soul
I'm looking for a place, there's no place for me
I hold my wounds while you hold the gun
We have our backs to each other, we locked the room
Who is the jester? Who is the king?
who is the dog who is the master
I have the answer to this, I'll take myself to the grave
I've known you for a minute, I'd make some memes out of you
To speak silver, to be silent gold
One more word, you're looking for teeth, that's what you deserve
By the teeth, by the teeth, by the teeth, by the teeth
I suggest you keep your mouth shut
My look won't help, your mouth will help

Oh-oh
This is going to hurt, I know it
Tonic in one hand, gin in the other
So many choices everywhere, so many numbers, so much pain as I write
So much pain that I live
I guess it should have been you
Who will pull me out of the shit I'm doing
And it probably should have been you, but rather you should have been here yesterday

Number on the hand, clean in the soul
I'm looking for a place, there's no place for me
I hold my wounds while you hold the gun
We have our backs to each other, we locked the room
Number on the hand and clean in the soul

A double cup is being filled - I pour Smirnoff

Baby is downstairs, um, playing limbo, giving me kisses, studying lingo
Call me Wiley and never Wilda
We aim up, we aim vertically
Um, okay, I'll take her where she wants to be
Body in perfect shape, we close the gate together
And we burn bridges, we screw up Instagram, we screw up posts
I just want to enjoy relationships in my own way, not to say anything
In silence, these gems cannot be described

And if it's a brother, I'll be the executioner
I swallow a hundred at night and lift a hundred during the day
Your life is a bit of a joke, mine is HESOYAM
When I die, sell all the demos to my brothers
Where is my promised land?
Where are the streams full of honey?
She made up the codes, took them with her
You promised a feast, so far a lot of ice

But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me

So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older

And I didn't know﻿ I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know ﻿I was lost

I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
I hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game﻿ made for everyone
And love is the prize

Guess who's back? Back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back? Guess who's back?
Guess who's back? Guess who's back?
Guess who's back? Guess who's back?
Guess who's back
I've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to
See Marshall no more; they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (Hey!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me, so
Come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits, and get ready
'Cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, fuck you, Debbie!

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me

Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners, helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch!""
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, polluting the airwaves, a rebel
So just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass—you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, da-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in, and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter, I'm interesting
The best thing since wrestling, infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, ""Attention please""

Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But, sometimes, the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene (Yeah)

To do Black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey!)

Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea

Obie Trice, real name, no gimmicks *record scratch*

Two trailer park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside
Two trailer park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside
(Woo!) (Ooh-ooh-ooh)

Guess who's back? Back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back? Guess who's back?
Guess who's back? Guess who's back?
Guess who's back? Guess who's back?
Guess who's back
I've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to
See Marshall no more; they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (Hey!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me, so
Come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits, and get ready
'Cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, fuck you, Debbie!

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners, helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch!""
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, polluting the airwaves, a rebel
So just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass—you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, da-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in, and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter, I'm interesting
The best thing since wrestling, infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, ""Attention please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents; my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit-for-tat wit'
Anybody who's talking ""This shit, that shit""
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You thirty-six-year-old baldheaded fag, blow me
You don't know me; you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But, sometimes, the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene (Yeah)
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do Black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey!)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy

Od tý doby, co jsi pryč
Má hlava je pryč, lítá nad kdysi
Mý tělo je to jediný, co ji vrací na zem
Asi budu víc busy
Vím jak na to, jen potřebuju pohyb
Tančit tak, ať kolabujou nohy
Zařvat tak, ať probudim bohy
Jsem moc nahlas, tak mi polib
Máte to taky tak, tak pojďte
Máte něco proti, tak choďte do pi...
Čelo zpocený tak moc, že si asi fakt konečně sahám na dno. (eh)

I když to nevidí oni, (eh) ty mě chápeš snadno, (eh)

A kde jsi byla bylo byl
Když padaly špatný choises like. (eh)
Jsi moje láska k sobě, (eh)
Můj cíl, můj trénink. (eh)
Moje víra, to že tady něco měnim, když se měnim. (eh)

Since you've been gone
My head is gone, it flies over the past
My body is the only thing that brings her back to earth
I'll probably be more busy
I know how to do it, I just need movement
Dance until your legs collapse
Howl to wake the gods
I'm very loud, so kiss me
It's the same for you, so come on
If you mind, go to the pi...
My forehead is sweating so much that I'm probably finally reaching the bottom. (huh)

Even if they can't see it, (eh) you understand me easily, (eh)
It's just that you don't deal with it that much
You don't, aleiaio, iaio
You don't, aleiaio, iaio
You don't, aleiaio, iaio
You don't, aleiaio, iaio

Since you are what you are
I ask myself who you are
And where you were, he was
When the bad choises fell like. (huh)
You're my love for you, (eh)
My goal, my training. (huh)
My faith, that I change something here when I change. (huh)

It's the same for you, so come on
If you mind, go to the pi...

But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye

I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away
You could've asked me why I broke your heart
You could've told me that you fell apart
But you walked past me like I wasn't there
And just pretended like you didn't care

I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away

Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another

Save your tears for another day
Save your tears for another day (So)

I made you think that I would always stay
I said some things that I should never say
Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine
And now you won't love me for a second time

88,88,88,88,88,88,88,Viktor Sheen,Blessed,"Blessed Lyrics

Jsem hluboko v tomhle shitu, ale nemám hluboko do kapsy
Každej rok vozim ti hudbu do uší, přijedu jak taxi
A peníze choděj jak faxy, sleduj mě, sleduj mě v akci
Z mladýho zmrda je muž, zatímco ostatní zůstali chlapci

Píčo, jsem blessed –⁠ požehnanej, začínám bejt vyrovnanej
Začínám zapomínat píčoviny, na to proč jsem plamenem ošlehanej
Jeli jsme na světlech doleva do džungle –⁠ svět, tam byl černobílej
Já jsem tam byl, kde jsi byl ty, když byla potřeba tam bejt?
Teď vidim barvy tam, kde byla dřív jen tma
Vyhodim za svou queen 200k jen tak
Bitches hážou bait, ale rodinu drží chlap
Takhle to dělá Sheen, bitch, to je můj správnej stav
Jako malej kluk jsem doufal, že najdu bag a v něm ten guap
S jídlem rostla chuť, ale bůh mi dopřál dobrej zrak
Money maj zvláštní pach, ale neboj se, já mám dobrej čich
Na hotovost dobrej hmat, tvůj boy má dobrej sluch na hit
A z lidí je mi stále zle
Všude špína, ptám se kde jsou mý bros, řekni kde
Máme love, stejně bída, zůstal mi jen rap
Dělal jsem to už, když tobě hrálo nu ma, nu ma iei

Pak jsem v rapu našel ten bag
Koupil chainy a sundal je, tak o co tady teď kurva jde?
Už tady nejde jen o můj krk
Už nemyslim jenom na sebe a ten, kdo jo, pro mě kunda je
Teď přede mnou jenom ulice
Příběhy a sny v muzice, teď začne lítat ta munice
A jestli tohleto je jen sen
Určitě nechci budit se, teď určitě nechci budit se

A my dva máme jinou story
My dva máme jiný hobby, my dva máme jiný sny
A já už vim, jak v tom mám chodit
Zmrd roky vařil z vody, teď ti vařim další hit
A my dva máme jinou story

I'm deep in this shit, but I'm not deep in the pocket
Every year I bring music to your ears, I come like a taxi
And money go like fax machines, watch me, watch me in action
The young bastard is a man, while the others remain boys

Baby, I'm blessed –⁠ blessed, I'm starting to be balanced
I'm starting to forget the stuff, why I'm flame-whipped
We drove at the lights to the left into the jungle -⁠ the world, there was black and white
I was there, where were you when you needed to be there?
Now I see colors where before there was only darkness
I'll drop 200k for my queen just like that
Bitches throw the bait, but the guy keeps the family together
That's how Sheen does it, bitch, that's my right state
As a little boy, I hoped to find a bag with the guap in it
The appetite grew with the food, but God blessed me with good eyesight
Money has a strange smell, but don't worry, I have a good sense of smell
Good touch for cash, your boy has a good ear for a hit
And people still make me sick
Dirt everywhere, I ask where my bros are, tell me where
We have love, it's still misery, all I have left is rap
I already did it when you played nu ma, nu ma iei

Then I found the bag in rap
He bought the chains and took them off, so what the fuck is this all about?
It's not just about my neck anymore
I don't think only of myself anymore, and anyone who does is a cunt for me
Only the street in front of me now
Stories and dreams in music, now the ammunition starts flying
And if this is just a dream
I sure don't want to wake up, I sure don't want to wake up now

And the two of us have a different story
The two of us have different hobbies, the two of us have different dreams
And I already know how to walk in it
Zrmd has been cooking water for years, now I'm cooking you another hit

When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside came out to play

""Son, don't let it slip away""
He took me in his arms, I heard him say (Hey)

Your wild heart will live for younger days

Let me give you the picture like stencil
Fallin' out in a drought
No flow, rain wasn't pourin' down (Pourin' down)
See, that pain was all around
See, my mode was kinda lounged
Didn't know which, which way to turn
Flow was cool but I still felt burnt
Energy up, you can feel my surge
I'ma kill everything like this purge (Ayy)

Let's just get this straight for a second, I'ma work (Yuh)

Everything that I do is electric (Ayy)
I'ma keep it in a motion, keep it movin' like kinetic, ayy (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Put this shit in a frame, better know I don't blame
Everything that I say, man, I seen you deflate
Let me elevate, this ain't a prank
Have you walkin' on a plank, li-li-li-li-like
Both hands together, God, let me pray (Now let me pray), uh
I've been goin' right, right around, call that relay (Masked Wolf)
Pass the baton, back and I'm on
Swimmin' in the pool, Kendrick Lamar, uh (Ayy)
Want a piece of this, a piece of mine, my peace a sign

I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart

I'll give it to someone special (Special)
Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye

Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
""Happy Christmas,"" I wrapped it up and sent it

Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on

I'll give it to someone special (Special, oh)
Oh, oh, baby

A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face of a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover, but you tore me apart
Ooh-ooh
Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again

Talk about me so many times -⁠ voices
I hear my music and I can't stand
I will buy everything for my baby - it doesn't matter how much it costs
Then boys are curious, keep asking me how much I have
I'm asking, how long can you count?
Just to make sure you can handle it
I lit a fire that one day I will put out myself

Dude, you wanted to rap? Here you are
The sauce flows like lemonade
They won't bring me to my knees
I'm still grinding, no vacation
I take their sauce, here you have it
There is no one like me here
They won't bring me to my knees

My whole squad's in here, walking around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby ""The

Same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia
ADHD, Hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisier (Hey, hey)
In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (Ayy)
This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A
Laughing all the way to the bank, I spray flames
They cannot tame or placate the
Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled, did so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on

'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)

Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her

'Cause e'ry Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em
Swearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious

Evil, that means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people

I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em

I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade
I'm finna kill 'em and dump all their fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid

Ugh, you're a monster

I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla
Better hit the deck like the card dealer
My whole squad's in here, walking around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby ""The
Brain"" Heenan which is probably the
Same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia
ADHD, Hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisier (Hey, hey)
In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (Ayy)
This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A
Laughing all the way to the bank, I spray flames
They cannot tame or placate the
Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled, did so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on the guy with a missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of vodka
When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a

Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster

If you never gave a damn (Ayy), raise your hand
'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her
Face in my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Cristhian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
So they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Hari Kari
'Cause e'ry Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em
Swearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (Monster)
Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets
Evil, that means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade
I'm finna kill 'em and dump all their fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway

I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla

A ty jsi ty kecy o lásce chtěla
Představim tě svojí mámě třeba
A třeba taky ne, znáš mě, teda
Mý tracky, ale co je cíl víš, baby
Mít děti, ano, ale nejdřív dej mi
Ass do ruky, kozu do pusy
Schody nahoru, dřep, dřep, dřep za ty pokusy
To neni moje chyba, můžeš za to sama
Ta věc pod těma šatama je panorama
Panameru pro ten zadek, ale mojí ne
Zapomeň na všechno z toho, co si tady povíme (Haha)

Promile na promile, emoce na emoce
Namotanej, slibuju ti rance

I'm a little sorry
He's a lefty but I wouldn't have it any other way, I lied (I lied)
Mesmerized by those movements
Forget everything, I lied (I take it back)
It flew a lot
After all, I left like a twenty on that bar, I lied (Hahaha)
But now you can trust me
I only tell you the plain truth, I lied (I lied)
I meant it yesterday
And you wanted that nonsense about love
I'll introduce you to my mom, for example
And maybe not, you know me, right?
My tracks, but you know what the goal is, baby
Have children, yes, but give me first
Ass in hand, goat in mouth
Up the stairs, squat, squat, squat for those attempts
It's not my fault, it's your own fault
That thing under that dress is a panorama
Panamera for that ass, but not mine
Forget everything we talk about here (Haha)

I look up from the ground
To see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me
And I see there's something you're trying to hide
And I reach for your hand but it's cold
You pull away again
And I wonder what's on your mind
And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble and your voice begins to break
You say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's
They were my mate's
And I feel the colour draining from my face
And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be alright""

So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent
And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head
And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone
And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on
But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
But I just wanna stay

And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be okay
It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
So bottoms up, let's forget tonight
You'll find another and you'll be just fine
Let her go""

Hned se vrátíš

Zkus se nadechnout

V žilách život teče dál
Tak ho přece v sobě nech
Než ti navždy dojde dech

Když nemůžeš, tak přidej víc
Zakřič prostě z plných plic
Že to dáš, na to máš
Že to dáš

Z plánů rychle sejde
Hned máš důvod proč to nejde
Problém s chůzí
Máš v ní zmatky
Vpřed jdeš o krok
Ale o dva zpátky

You rest every moment
Sometimes you like it
You will shorten the journey
You barely get out
You'll be right back

Just scream at the top of your lungs

May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here...

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh!)
It's the return of the ""Oh, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said… nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Ha ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
""Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who,"" ""Yeah, but he's so cute though""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes—
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (Nope)
Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn about a GRAMMY?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?""
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh!)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me

I'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: ""How can kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, 'cause at the rate, I'm going, when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

Lidi svítěj a my stojíme spolu ve stínu
Modrý oči jako kdybych koukal do safíru
Tuhle noc mi klidně ulož, potom nakopíruj
Dneska vysoko jsem, nejdu zpátky, zem je láva
Stojíme spolu ve stínu
Modrý oči jako kdybych koukal do safíru
Tuhle noc mi klidně ulož, potom nakopíruj
Dneska vysoko jsem, nejdu zpátky, zem je láva
Už jsi mi řekla kolikrát, že ti sluší zelená
Projíždíme noční Prahou, Louboutinky na nohách
Byl jsem tě vzít mezi nás, koupil tohle a vzal tam
Ukaž mi, co umí tvář, trochu make-up, trochu pláč
Ale vidim Niagáry, vždycky, když se ti otáčím zády
Na nic, ale nic, co bych neuměl spravit
Jedu k tobě nad ránem a v sobě číši pravdy
Ztracení a mladí jsme
Už jsi mi řekla tolikrát, že mi nesluší být sám
Ukaž mi, co umíš, v tomhle chladu chtěl bych cítit žár
Chtělas dojít mezi nás, nevadí to, mám to rád
Jsem to říkal tolikrát, jsem to říkal tolikrát

Lidi svítěj a my stojíme spolu vе stínu
Modrý oči jako kdybych koukal do safíru
Tuhle noc mi klidně ulož, potom nakopíruj
Dneska vysoko jsem, nеjdu zpátky, zem je láva
Stojíme spolu ve stínu
Modrý oči jako kdybych koukal do safíru
Tuhle noc mi klidně ulož, potom nakopíruj
Dneska vysoko jsem, nejdu zpátky, zem je láva

Jsme chodili po stokách
To, že jsem vsadil na to, že vystoupám, byla gamba
Pouštim novej track, ty posloucháš
A po každý větě, co řeknu, kejchám – je to pravda
Baby sweet jak mango, nohy tančej tango
Hvězdná noc je – Van Gogh
Nabíháme s bandou, plná kára – cargo, brati moji za mnou
Fialovej drink a potom letim do vesmíru
Dávaj papír, já mám další téma na papíru
Mluví o nás, snad maj před prahama zametýno
Brno, Praha v jednu ráno vidim rohatýho

People shine and we stand together in the shadows
Blue eyes as if I were looking into a sapphire
Feel free to save this night for me, then copy it
I'm high today, I'm not going back, the ground is lava
We stand together in the shadows
Blue eyes as if I were looking into a sapphire
Feel free to save this night for me, then copy it
I'm high today, I'm not going back, the ground is lava
You've already told me how many times you like green
We drive through Prague at night, Louboutins on our feet
I was going to take you between us, bought this and took you there
Show me what a face can do, a little makeup, a little cry
But I see Niagara, every time I turn my back on you
Nothing, but nothing I couldn't do
I come to you early in the morning, drinking the truth in myself
We are lost and young
You've told me so many times that I shouldn't be alone
Show me what you can do, in this cold I want to feel the heat
You wanted to come between us, it doesn't matter, I like it
I've said it so many times, I've said it so many times

People shine and we stand together in the shade
Blue eyes as if I were looking into a sapphire
Feel free to save this night for me, then copy it
I'm high today, I'm not going back, the ground is lava
We stand together in the shadows
Blue eyes as if I were looking into a sapphire
Feel free to save this night for me, then copy it
I'm high today, I'm not going back, the ground is lava

We walked in the sewers
The fact that I made a bet that I was going up was a gamble
I'm playing a new track, you're listening
And after every sentence I say, I sneer - it's true
Baby sweet like a mango, legs dance the tango
Starry Night is - Van Gogh
We run with the gang, a full cart - cargo, my brothers behind me
A purple drink and then I fly into space
Give me the paper, I have another topic on paper
They're talking about us, maybe you've got your doorsteps swept
Brno, Prague at one in the morning I see a horned

If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would pop champagne and raise a toast
To all of the queens who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancing on your own

Can't live without me, you wanna, but you can't, nah-nah-nah
Think it's funny, but honey, can't run this show on your own
I can feel my body shake, there's only so much I can take
I'll show you how a real queen behaves (Oh)
No damsel in distress, don't need to save me
Once I start breathin' fire, you can't tame me
And you might think I'm weak without a sword
But if I had one, it'd be bigger than yours

If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would pop champagne and raise a toast
To all of the queens who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancing on your own

Disobey me, then baby, it's off with your head
Gonna change it and make it a world you won't forget (Oh)

No damsel in distress, don't need to save me
Once I start breathin' fire, you can't tame me
And you might think I'm weak without a sword
But I'm stronger than I ever was before

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them

Nebo mám radši otevřít další láhev, s další láhví neucejtím nic
Když otevřu okno, vidím svět co mi neříká nic
Mi neříká nic, mi neříká nic
A když se cejtím na hovno mám hudbu
Co si pouštím aby bylo líp, díky svý rodině mám
Lidi za kterejma můžu jít, ve dvou všechno líp
Já mám celou smečku psů, takže jenom rok od roku líp

Koukni mi do tváře, nejsem blázen

Získávat a zase ztrácet

I play your songs that I wrote to you
It's almost midnight and the bell from the church reminds me of the night
I'll go have a drink and put it out, what's next?
I put a few of the letters you sent under the pillow
You write that you like me and you're homesick
It's almost midnight and the bell from the church reminds me of the night

I am with you to tell you that I will not call you again
For one stupid girl, for a few nights of desire
I cheated everything you can dream of at home, now I'm sorry

How many times can a person like, really out of love?
Twice? or three times? no, once is enough
It's almost midnight and the bell from the church reminds me of the night
I'll go have a drink and put it out, what's next?

I wanted the morning he last had breakfast
I am with you to tell you that I will not call you again
For one stupid girl, for a few nights of desire
I'm a fraud, everything you dream of at home, now I'm sorry

Oh, hush, my dear, it's been a difficult year

Trust me, darlin', trust me darlin'

I'm a man of three fears:
Integrity, faith, and crocodile tears
Trust me, darlin', trust me, darlin'

So look me in the eyes (Eyes), tell me what you see (You see)
Perfect paradise (—Dise), tearin' at the seams (Seams)
I wish I could escape it (Escape), I don't wanna fake it
Wish I could erase it (Erase), make your heart believe

I'm ready to air it out on all these niggas, I can see 'em runnin'
Just talked to my mama, she hit me on FaceTime just to check up on me and my brother
I'm really the baby, she know that her youngest son was always guaranteed to get the money (Okay, let's go)
She know that her baby boy was always guaranteed to get the loot
She know what I do, she know 'fore I run from a nigga, I'ma pull it out and shoot (Boom)
PTSD, I'm always waking up in cold sweats like I got the flu
My daughter a G, she saw me kill a nigga in front of her before the age of two
And I'll kill another nigga too
'Fore I let another nigga do somethin' to you
Long as you know that, don't let nobody tell you different
Daddy love you (Yeah, yeah)

Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar? (Yeah)
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (Woo)
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me (Woo)
You better let me go the day you need me (Woo)
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (Woo, yeah)

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life, and realize there's nothin' left
'Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long, that
Even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how you talkin', and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke
Fool, I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the streetlight
They've been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
They've been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise

Look at the situation they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the state
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watchin' got me chasin' dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand, and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
And my homies is down, so don't arouse my anger
Fool, death ain't nothin' but a heartbeat away
I'm livin' life do or die, what can I say?
I'm 23 now, but will I live to see 24?
The way things is goin', I don't know
Tell me, why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?

Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that this story ends
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

When the evening falls
And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well, it's eating me up inside
But we ran our course, we pretended we're okay
Now if we jump together, at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made

I'm at a party I don't wanna be at
And I don't ever wear a suit and tie, yeah
Wonderin' if I could sneak out the back
Nobody's even lookin' me in my eyes
Then you take my hand
Finish my drink, say, ""Shall we dance?"" (Hell, yeah)
You know I love ya, did I ever tell ya?
You make it better like that

Don't think I fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say (Yeah)
I always feel like I'm nobody, mmm
Who wants to fit in anyway?
'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah

We at a party we don't wanna be at
Tryna talk, but we can't hear ourselves
Read your lips, I'd rather kiss 'em right back
With all these people all around
I'm crippled with anxiety
But I'm told it's where I'm s'posed to be
You know what? It's kinda crazy 'cause I really don't mind
When you make it better like that

Don't think we fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say, oh yeah, yeah
When we walked in, I said I'm sorry, mmm
But now I think that we should stay

Za zády hoří město, jarní vzduch voní deštěm
Nevíš, kdo má nůž v kapse, proto se nikdy nesměj
Neslyším slova, jsi ještěr, píčo, chráním si svýma pěstma místo
Dělaj že neví, kdo jsem, ví to, čím dál víc hot, jak Costa Rica
Letím lodí, oceán tmy, sám dál jako Lister, piš to
Hodím myšlenky na papír a pak je prodám za míče, míč tam
Chtějí to dělat za love – vím to, dělaj, bojí se tmy – já vím to
A koho všechno měla – vím to, mám svojí hlavu, kecáš píčo
Ale víš, po show místy chodím vybombenej jako tank
Hlavně být rovnej, hlavně být stejnej, není to jenom tak
Stack červenej jak rak, yah, kapsa plno jak sack
Byl jsem na místech, kterýma si stejně vždycky musíš projet jen sám
V ruce double D, v kapse double g a doubluju, doubluju na účtech mých
A mám skinny B a pak neřeším a smysl textu, hlavně, že mi zní
A nepřeju nikomu basu, ale In3gue, doufám, že tě nikdy nepustí
A hlídám si záda dvakrát od doby, co jsem poznal krysu jako ty
Ale Ektor naučil, hlavní, co přijde na účet
Hlavní mít v rodině klid a dokud to bude, tak účel splnil
Připijím na všechny ženy, připijím, protože můžem
Připijím na moje bratry, ať slyším celej sál jen: ""Santé""

The city is burning behind, the spring air smells of rain
You never know who has a knife in their pocket, so never laugh
I can't hear the words, you're a lizard, cunt, I'm protecting my place with my fists
Pretend he doesn't know who I am, he knows it, more and more hot, like Costa Rica
I'm flying a ship, ocean of darkness, alone on like Lister, drink it
I put thoughts on paper and then sell them for balls, ball there
They want to do it for the hunt - I know it, do it, they're afraid of the dark - I know it
And who did she have - I know, I have my own head, you bitch
But you know, after the show, sometimes I'm pumped up like a tank
The main thing is to be equal, the main thing is to be the same, it's not just like that
Stack red as a crab, yah, pocket full as a sack
I've been to places you always have to drive by yourself anyway
Double D in my hand, double g in my pocket and double, double on my accounts
And I have skinny B and then I don't deal with the meaning of the text, mainly because it sounds to me
And I don't wish bass on anyone, but In3gue, I hope they never let you go
And I've been watching my back twice since I met a rat like you
But Ektor learned, the main thing, what comes to the account
The main thing is to have peace in the family, and as long as it lasts, the purpose has been fulfilled
I'll toast to all the women, I'll toast because I can
I will make a toast to my brothers so that the whole hall can only hear: ""Santé""

Díky penězům jsem svobodnej
Ale frustrovanej o to víc, že můžu skončit ze dne na den
Můžeš mě vidět řídit černej Benz, S 500 AMG
Brabus kola točí sе, vpředu leskne sе stříbrnej zaměřovač, tututu
Z vejfuku nasranej zvu-uk
Harman Kardon, z okna hraje hudba, zabijí stres
Našel jsem štěstí v maličkostech
Skvělý jídlo, velká postel, dobrá tráva, správný víno
Hezký holky na noc, mý boys balej ganju jako dárky
Se cejtim jak o Vánocích –⁠ Jingle Bells

Se cejtim jako Ježíšek
Um, když budou ty Vánoce
Tak mám pro vás takovej vzkaz
Kterej byste si měli vzít k srdci

Jakej pán, takovej pes, váš pán Agent StB
Nechápu, že trpíte komunisty a nácky
Jestli to vidíš jinak, přijď si pro facku
Víš, kde bydlim, jestli ne, tak pošlu ti adresu
17. listopadu je den boje za svobodu
Navždycky bojovat budu

Same story, different day
Same story, different day
Same story, different day for a few months now
Same story, different day, Tendo

Same story, different day
Same story, different day for a few months now
Same bullshit everyday for a few years now
Money makes me free
But all the more frustrated that I can quit overnight
You can see me driving a black Benz, S 500 AMG
The Brabus wheels spin, a silver sight shines in front, tututu
From the vejfuk pissed off sound-uk
Harman Kardon, music playing from the window, kill stress
I found happiness in the little things
Great food, big bed, good weed, good wine
Good night girls, my boys wrap ganja like presents
I feel like Christmas -⁠ Jingle Bells

I feel like Jesus
Um, when it's Christmas
So I have such a message for you
Which you should take to heart

What a gentleman, such a dog, your master Agent StB
I don't understand that you suffer from communists and Nazis
If you see it differently, come for a slap
Do you know where I live, if not I will send you the address
November 17 is the day of the fight for freedom
I will fight forever
And if you're not with me, you're against me
And if you're not with me, you're against me
And if you're not with me, you're against me

Vdechuju prach
Tahle doba ukazuje kdo je tvůj brácha
Tahle doba ukazuje kolik je stav
V ulicích temno a lidi maj strach

Kde je můj, kde je můj, kde je můj brat?
S kym se vezeme, když máme novej truck?
Cejtim smrad
Projedu město sám a chybí mi vůně z trav, pach
Sedíme v trůně z kůže a na sobě vůně z růže a divnej zrak
Sledujou nás jak můžou
Celej život nad hlavou, černej mrak
Jsem vychovanej možná jak lůza, ale nedopadnu jak loser (Ne)
Já jsem vylez ven z domu hrůzy
A teď vidim, jak se lidi chovaj jak čůzy
Fotr v Benzu cruisin', ulice slyší mou music
Myšlenky letěj jak kulky, co opustí komoru z nabitý Uzi
Hladovej den, yeah, cejtim krev (Co?)
Utrhli si další kus ze mě, mám další steh
Procházim další kus země, žádnej spěch (Ne)
More, kam ten spěch? V klidu si míchám to kafe na track
Tak dlouho jsme čekali na tenhle flek (Dlouho, ayy)
A neboj se, tyhleti zmrdi nespěj (Ne)
Lidi už se nezměněj (Ne), je jedno co si myslej
Ta hudba tě odnese do piče, jebni si play (Jebni si play)

I inhale dust
This time shows who your brother is
This time shows how much the status is
The streets are dark and people are afraid

Where is mine, where is mine, where is my brother?
Who do we drive with when we have a new truck?
I smell the stench
I drive through the city alone and I miss the smell of the grass, the smell
We sit in a throne made of leather and wear the scent of roses and a strange sight
They follow us as best they can
All life overhead, black cloud
I may be raised like a loon, but I won't end up like a loser (No)
I'm climbing out of the house of horrors
And now I see how people act like fools
Fotr in the Benz cruisin', the street hears my music
Thoughts fly like bullets leaving the chamber of a loaded Uzi
Hungry day, yeah, I smell blood (What?)
They took another piece out of me, I have another stitch
I'm walking another piece of land, no rush (No)
Sea, where's the rush? I calmly mix the coffee on the track
We've been waiting so long for this stain (Long, ayy)
And don't worry, these motherfuckers don't sleep (No)
People, don't change (No), it doesn't matter what you think
That music will take your ass, fuck play (Fuck play)

Every day of mine, that's Sunday, I go that way –⁠ runway
They started for fun and we because we are hungry
There's a fire in the fire pit and I'll always offer you only the truth

I only take what was stolen from me
Then I see colors all around me

Ooh, cejtim se jak kdybych byl v ZOO
ZOO, sedim po show, počítám loot
Ona sedí vedle, roní svoje slzy na stůl
Neboj, na každou Emmu tam někde čeká její Zoot

Ooh, já nejsem tvůj boo, ale cool
Můžeš tady bejt i když už táhne z tebe booze
Ooh, její největší slabina je pool
A je utržená jako lavina, když si dá půlku
Víš, jak se to říká, proti gustu, ale trochu smrdí plastem
A trochu levnym chlastem
Já vyndal jsem jí z krabice a procházíme městem
Já nepodvádim, neni pravá
Tohle nemusím a stejně půjdu s ní
Když jsem tě uviděl, tak jsem nevěřil na upíry
Říkám si kdе to jsem, jestli jsem na mý show
Nеbo v muzeu voskovejch figurín

Nejde popsat a mně začíná být fakt divně z těchhle postav

Ooh, I feel like I'm in a zoo
ZOO, sitting after the show, counting the loot
She sits next to her, shedding her tears on the table
Don't worry, there's a Zoot waiting for every Emma out there somewhere

Ooh I'm not your boo but cool
You can be here even if you're already drinking booze
Ooh, her biggest weakness is pool
And she's taken like an avalanche when she takes half
You know what they say, against the taste, but it smells a bit like plastic
And some cheap booze
I took her out of the box and we walk through the city
I'm not cheating, she's not real
I don't need this and I'll go with her anyway
When I saw you, I didn't believe in vampires
I wonder where I am, if I'm on my show
Or in a wax museum

Silicone at least per milli
I hope her system doesn't have viruses

Show me what makes you hot, yeah
I'm walking through the club with my bros, yeah
They have a nose for these things, yeah
But what you see here cannot be described
It's indescribable and I'm starting to feel really weird about these characters

We couldn't turn around 'til we were upside down
I'll be the bad guy now, but know I ain't too proud
I  couldn't be there even when I tried
You  don't believe it, we do this every time
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed  the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm  waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go
I said so, I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex though, the sex though
And I still hear the echoes (The echoes)
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go

Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all


I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico
But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go

Neseď doma pri kompe,poď s nami
Von ! - (poď so mnou von)
Ži raz, tu, teraz
Slnko svieti rovnako na nás
Všetkých spolu
Od jazier k moru
Poď von pozývam na kofolu
Leto je to moje milované obdobie
Som v pohode si tu so mnou, že?
Tak smej sa na mňa, tancuj blízko
Vieš jak minule, presne tak isto
Odložme mikiny, kostýmy, saká
Pláže, bikiny, leto nás čaká
Farby kvetov letia vzduchom
Čo vietor sfúkol v žiari lúčov
Žijeme len raz, práve tu a práve teraz
Slnko svieti rovnako na všetkých z nás
Tak sa nemrač, ale zabudni na stres
Zabudni, čo tu bolo včera, dneska je tu ďalší deň

Zabudni, čo tu bolo včera, dneska je tu ďalší deň

Aspoň raz to nerobme len pre love, preži to
Urobme to pre love, párty smiech a zážitok

Don't sit at home at the computer, come with us
Out! - (come out with me)
Live once, here, now
The sun shines on us as well
All together
From the lakes to the sea
I invite you to come out for a party
Summer is my favorite season
I'm fine, you're here with me, right?
So laugh at me, dance close
You know like last time, exactly the same
Let's put away sweatshirts, suits, jackets
Beaches, bikinis, summer awaits us
The colors of the flowers fly through the air
Which the wind blew in the radiance of the rays
We only live once, right here and right now
The sun shines equally on all of us
So don't frown, but forget about stress
Forget what was here yesterday, today is another day
Water, sun, party, club, relax
We only live once, right here and right now
The sun shines equally on all of us
So don't frown, but forget about stress
Forget what was here yesterday, today is another day
Water, sun, party, club, relax
At least once, let's not do it just for love, live it
Let's do it for love, party laughs and experience
This is music, so this is peace
This is cool, so believe it
This is music, so this is peace
This is summer as it should be, believe me

I found a love for me
Oh, darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

I found a love for me
Oh, darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds

Lásko tohle je lovesong pro tebe
Abych ti dokázal, jak tě miluju
Ha..
Miluju tě od tý doby, co tě pustili z Bohnic
A ten kouř, co ti vychází z plic
Perník je jediný, co umíš píct
Alkohol - jediný, co umíš pít
Ale lásko, víš, že mi nevadí nic. (Ha)
Nevadí mi, že nemáš nic
Víš, miluju to jak se tváříš
Když máš v ruce nůž a spíš
Víš, když jsem s tebou
Nezajímá mě, co ostatní melou
Nezajímám se vo ostatní lidi
My jsme ti dva, co se jim smějou
Jsme dva, co se vždy sjedou
Dej si prášek - dám si s tebou
Chceš skočit? Skočím s tebou
Pod auta. Koukej už jedou
Vypadáš jak královna v tý kazajce
Miluju to, jak jseš bledá
Vím moc dobře, co mi dáváš ty
Mi žádná jiná nedá
Žádná není tak šílená
Mám šestnáct bodnejch ran
I když stává se, že chvílema
Nevim, jak od tebe utéct dál. (Ha)
Vždycky, když přijdu domu
Vidím tebe ve tmě stát
Jen bílý oči
V nich červenej plamen vidím plát

Nemusíš se mě ptát
Jen říkám, že to bude měsíc

Vim, že mě miluješ a zároveň proklínáš
Dám ti prášek do pití, vidím jak usínáš
Miluju to, jak se na mě usmíváš,.
Vem si tu pistol, ukaž démona, co ukrýváš!
Vim, že mě miluješ a zároveň proklínáš
Dám ti prášek do pití, a vidím jak umíráš
Bejvaly doby, kdy jsi fetovala
Víc, než měla jsi fetovat. (Fetovat)
Tvým jménem nechám se tetovat. (Tetovat)
Tebou nechám se vychovat
Nechám se unášet větama
Tahleta sekaná flow je jen pro tebe
Krev teče řekama, prášky padají deštěm na tebe
Každej tě teď musí milovat
Když jsem s tebou
Nezajímá mě co ostatní melou
Nezajímám se vo ostatní lidi
My jsme ti dva, co se jim smějou
Jsme dva, co se vždy sjedou
Dej si prášek - dám si s tebou
Chceš skočit? Skočím s tebou
Pod auta. Koukej už jedou
Vypadáš jak královna v tom prostěradle
V ruce držíš jehlu

Máš krásně červený oči
Studenou kůži v tom vedru
Jen tě svážu, notak nevrč, nebruč

Baby this is a love song for you
To prove to you how much I love you
Huh..
I've loved you ever since you were released from Bohnice
And the smoke coming out of your lungs
Gingerbread is the only thing you can bake
Alcohol - the only thing you can drink
But love, you know I don't mind. (Ha)
I don't mind if you don't have anything
You know, I love the way you look
When you have a knife in your hand and you're sleeping
You know when I'm with you
I don't care what other people think
I'm not interested in other people
We are the two laughing at them
We are two that always get together
Take a pill - I'll deal with you
Do you want to jump? I'll jump with you
Under cars. Look, they're already going
You look like a queen in that jacket
I love how pale you are
I know very well what you give me
No other will give me
None are that crazy
I have sixteen stab wounds
Although it happens that at times
I don't see how to run away from you. (Ha)
Every time I come home
I see you standing in the dark
Just white eyes
I see a sheet of red flame in them
You might also like I'll be with you until death
You don't have to ask me
I'm just saying it'll be a month
Two at most
I love the way you smile at me.
Take that gun, show the demon what you're hiding!
I know you love me and curse me at the same time
I'll give you a powder to drink, I'll see you fall asleep
I love the way you smile at me.
Take that gun, show the demon what you're hiding!
I know you love me and curse me at the same time
I'll give you a powder to drink and watch you die
There was a time when you feted
More than you should have fetted. (Take drugs)
I will get your name tattooed. (Tattoo)
I will be raised by you
I get carried away by the sentences
This Flow chopstick is just for you
Blood flows in rivers, pills rain down on you
Everyone must love you now
When I am with you
I don't care what other people say
I'm not interested in other people
We are the two laughing at them
We are two that always get together
Take a pill - I'll deal with you
Do you want to jump? I'll jump with you
Under cars. Look, they're already going
You look like a queen in that sheet
You are holding a needle in your hand
I can't find Vim anywhere
Even more cedar
You have beautiful red eyes
Cold skin in the heat
I'm just going to tie you up, don't growl, don't growl
I know I'll sit down. (Ahh)
Every time I come home
I see you standing in the dark
Just white eyes
I see a sheet of red flame in them
I will be with you until death

Figure it out without you
And I'm done sitting home without you
Fuck, I'm going out without you

It's morning
I go to sleep
I don't know what day it is today
I don't want to ask
If life, what do I have now
I like blood in my veins
Drunk
It won't replace you
Even if it flows on
Where do I have you
I'm calling
I hope to see you again
Although you probably haven't missed me in a long time

Sometimes I want to go to your house
Lying in the covers
Whisper those poems to you
What were just about us
Sometimes I think about it
Probably a little too much
I'm waking up from a dream
I am calling you for help
Sometimes I want to go to your house
Lying in the covers
Whisper those poems to you

I have those conditions
How about a liter of coffee
I hear velvet on the radio
And I'm swimming again

How about a liter of coffee

Dávej respekt na mý name (Jméno)
A mluv o mně pěkně nebo vůbec
Flow neteče, je to spíš úlet (Fuu)

V mojí hlavě prachy, není tam žádná čůza
Jdeme furt dopředu a ne ústup (Ne)
A swag, level tak vysoko, že ho nemůžete ukrást (Nikdy)
Nikdy nejedeme na úvěr, život má placený úseky
Já jsem vlk, oni kůzlata
Sorry, mě nebaví žít od vejplaty k vejplatě
Máme jiný pravidla, my máme jinou ústavu
A mám deja vu jak beat na loop, hah

Koukal jsem, ale neviděl jsem

Money in my head, there's no mess
We keep moving forward and not retreating (No)
And swag, level so high you can't steal it (Never)

Runnin' through this strange life
Chasin' all them green lights
Throwin' off the shade for a little bit of sunshine
Hit me with them good vibes
Pictures on my phone like
Everything is so fine
A little bit of sunshine

Crazy lately I'm confirmin'
Tryna write myself a sermon
You just tryna get a word in, life is not fair
I been workin' on my tunnel vision
Tryna get a new prescription
Takin' swings and even missin' but I don't care
I'm dancin' more just a little bit
Breathin' more just a little bit
Care a little less just a little bit
Like life is woo-hoo!
I'm makin' more just a littlе bit
Spend a little more to gеt rid of it
Smile a little more and I'm into it

Rádi píšem' na cizí zeď
A další jed plodí další jed
A to, že každej může mít svůj hlas
Neznamená, že musíš soudit nás

Jo, dávno nečtu komentáře
Páč bych musel nechat všeho bejt
Možná na Říp odehdá vylez’ spíš praotec Hate
Sousedova veranda je téma, který letí
Ukliď svoji, ráno bude stejně samý smetí
To ti poviem, brácho, rešpektuj aj svojho hatera
Predurčené milovať je každému, kto nenáviděl
A naši bili sa o slobodu eště včera
Tak pre pár nevedomých nepopieraj jej zmysel

Rádi píšem' na cizí zeď
A další jed plodí další jed
A to, že každej může mít svůj hlas
Neznamená, že musíš soudit nás
Rádi píšem' na cizí zeď
A další jed plodí další jed
A to, že každej může mít svůj hlas
Neznamená, že musíš soudit nás

Maľujeme si čertov na tie cudzie stěny
Nech sa tiež bojí, keď si vystrašený
Nech je tiež smutná, keď si osamelý
Chceš, nech aj oni cítia tu bolesť, keď si utrápený
Ale tým sa nič nezmení, súdíš, sám si odsúdený

To ti poviem, brácho, rešpektuj aj svojho hatera

I like to write on someone else's wall
And another poison begets another poison
And that everyone can have their voice
Doesn't mean you have to judge us

Yeah, I haven't read the comments in a while
I would have to let everything go
Perhaps the great-grandfather Hate will climb Říp
The neighbor's porch is a hot topic
Clean up yours, it'll still be trash in the morning
I'll tell you this bro, respect your hater too
Destined to be loved by everyone who hated
And ours were fighting for freedom just yesterday
So for a few ignorant people, don't deny its meaning

I like to write on someone else's wall
And another poison begets another poison
And that everyone can have their voice
Doesn't mean you have to judge us
I like to write on someone else's wall
And another poison begets another poison
And that everyone can have their voice
Doesn't mean you have to judge us

We paint the devil on those foreign walls
Be afraid too when you are afraid
Make them sad too when you are lonely
You want, let them feel the pain when you are troubled
But the team won't change anything, you judge, you yourself are doomed

I'll tell you this bro, respect your hater too

You've been my muse for a long time
You get me through every dark night
I'm always gone, out on the go
I'm on the run and you're home alone
I'm too consumed with my own life

Are we too young for this?
Feels like I can't move
Sharing my heart
It's tearing me apart
But I know I'd miss you, baby, if I left right now
Doing what I can, tryna be a man
And every time I kiss you, baby
I can hear the sound of breaking down

I've been confused as of late (Yeah)
Watching my youth slip away (Yeah)
You're like the sun, you wake me up
But you drain me out if I get too much
I might need room or I'll break

Are we too young for this?

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak

You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)

Pour up the whole damn seal, I'ma get lazy

She sucked a nigga soul, gotta Cash App
Told 'em wipe a nigga nose, say slatt, slatt
I won't never sell my soul, and I can back that
And I really wanna know where you at, at
I was out back where the stash at
Cruise the city in a bulletproof Cadillac (Skrrt)
'Cause I know these niggas after where the bag at (Yeah)
Gotta move smarter, gotta move harder
Nigga try to get me for my water
I'll lay his ass down, on my son, on my daughter
I had the Draco with me, Dwayne Carter
Lotta niggas out here playin', ain't ballin'
I done put my whole arm in the rim, Vince Carter (Yeah)
And I know probably get a key for the quarter
Shawty barely seen in double C's, I bought 'em
Got a bitch that's looking like Aaliyah, she a model
I got the pink slip, all my whips is key-less
Compton, I'm about to get the key to the city

This type of love don't always come and go
I don't wanna ruin this one
This type of love don't always come and go

We take drugs, then you hold me close
Then I tell you how you make me whole
Sometimes, I feel you like bein' alone
Then you tell me that I shoulda stayed in the room
Guess I got it all wrong all along, my fault
My mistakes probably wipe all the rights I've done
Sayin' goodbye to bygones, those are bygones
Head up, baby, stay strong, we gon' live long

College girls give a nigga head in my Rafs
Rockstar life, so much money it'll make you laugh, hey

Off the juice (Juice), codeine got me trippin' (Juice)
Copped the coupe (Coupe), woke up, roof is missin' (Yeah)
Ice (Ice), lemonade, my neck was drippin'

Lips sealed, I ain't pillow talkin', I'm no rat (No)
In my earlobe, got two karats, VVS (Bling)
Got a penthouse near Rodeo off of stress (Stress)
All this money, when I grew up, I had nothing (Nothing)
Filled with backstabbers, my old life was disgusting (Disgusting)
Can't believe it, gotta thank God that I'm livin' comfortably (Thank God)
Gettin' checks, I don't believe her, she say she done with me
Burned some bridges and I let the fire light the way (Oh-woah)
Kickin' my feet up, left the PJs on a PJ (A PJ)
Yeah, I'm a big dawg, and I walk around with no leash (Oh-oh)
I got water on me, yeah, everything on Fiji

Alright, okay
Uh, alright, okay
Alright, okay

Return of the Mack
Get 'em; what it is? What it does? What it is? What it isn't?
Looking for a better way to get up outta bed
Instead of getting on the Internet
And checking on who hit me, get up
Thrift shop, pimp-strut walkin'
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Sweater game, nope, nope, y'all can't copy, yeah
Bad, moonwalking, this here is our party
My posse's been on Broadway, and we did it our way
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones
Into everything I record to it and yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit, hustlin'
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen
With the four-track, bussin'
Halfway 'cross that city with the back (Back) pack (Pack), fat (Fat) cat (Cat), crushin'

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Now, can I kick it? Thank you
Yeah, I'm so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But that's what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Y'all can't stop me
Go hard like I got a 808 in my heartbeat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on Shark Week, raw
Time to go off, I'm gone
Deuces, goodbye, I got a world to see
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer
Nah, I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Now, sing a song, and it goes like
Raise those hands, this is our party (Hey, hey, hey)
We came here to live life like nobody was watching (Hey, hey, hey, oh)

Days pass by, and my eyes, they dry, and I think that I'm okay
'Til I find myself in conversation, fading away
The way you smile, the way you walk
The time you took to teach me all that you had taught
Tell me, how am I supposed to move on?

These days I'm becoming everything that I hate
Wishing you were around, but now it's too late
My mind is a place that I can't escape your ghost
Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away
One more rainy day without you
Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day
One more rainy day

Oh, I'm a wreck without you here
Yeah, I'm a wreck since you've been gone
I've tried to put this all behind me
I think I was wrecked all along
Yeah, I'm a wreck

They say that the time will heal it, the pain will go away
But everything, it reminds me of you and it comes in waves
The way you laugh when your shoulders shook
The time you took to teach me all that you had taught
Tell me, how am I supposed to move on?

These days I'm becoming everything that I hate
Wishing you were around, but now it's too late
My mind is a place that I can't escape your ghost

Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away
One more rainy day without you
Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day
One more rainy day

Down the river, we're drunk, and all of our thumbs went up in the air

Too young to feel this old
Watching us both turn cold

I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think

My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's comin' from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter

Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious

Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones
Into everything I record to it and yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit, hustlin'

Yeah, I'm so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But that's what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Y'all can't stop me
Go hard like I got a 808 in my heartbeat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on Shark Week, raw
Time to go off, I'm gone
Deuces, goodbye, I got a world to see
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer
Nah, I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Now, sing a song, and it goes like
Raise those hands, this is our party (Hey, hey, hey)

Now, can I kick it? Thank you
Yeah, I'm so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But that's what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Y'all can't stop me
Go hard like I got a 808 in my heartbeat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on Shark Week, raw
Time to go off, I'm gone
Deuces, goodbye, I got a world to see
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer
Nah, I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Now, sing a song, and it goes like
Raise those hands, this is our party (Hey, hey, hey)
We came here to live life like nobody was watching (Hey, hey, hey, oh)
I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me (Hey, hey, hey)
Learn from that failure, gain humility (Hey, hey, hey)
And then we keep marching, I said

Než udělám boober, checkuj mě na tour
Pokud chceš mý jméno někam psát, dej love na stůl
Zatim ostatní odkvétaj, má cena stoupá vzhůru
Čas mi dovolil vyzrát, na všechny ty losers
Checkuj tu tvrdou kůži, tu tlustou kůru

Koukej jak zářím nad ránem, plný kapsy, pár přátel
Zlato na prst a je to tak, že neřeším, neslyším
Baby poslouchá jazyk, poslouchá jak vychovanej jsem na jinej zvyk
Jen svoje a tak to je, další já nevidím

No tak tanči, řekni kdy přidat, kdy stačí
Cítím tvojí vůni, shawty, cítím jak se hýbeš, shawty
Vidím na tobě jak záříš, že cítíš co teďka máme
Vim, že nad ránem, vim, že nad ránem budeme sami a co bude dál?
Vim, že jezdim republikou a že nemám čas
Že na mě počkáš, že ti stojim za ty vrásky
Je to pro mě všechno nový, doteď jsem žil sám
Jedu ať ti koupim Chanel, ať se máš fajn
Vidim, že máš ráda Itálii stejně jak já
Budeme se usmiřovat stejně jako hádat
Baby, dokud budeš tady, tak vim, kde je pravda
Chybí mi po boku někdo, kdo tu bude zářit
Mluvím jen z duše a žádný na shledanou
Vidím tě prvně, ale už myslím na příště
Víš, že mluví teď chlast, ale nemyslim na jinou
Ale byl jsem v správnej čas asi na správným místě

No tak tanči, řekni kdy přidat, kdy stačí
Cítím tvojí vůni, shawty, cítím jak se hýbeš, shawty
Vidím na tobě jak záříš, že cítíš co teďka máme
Vim, že nad ránem, vim, že nad ránem budeme sami a co bude dál?

Look how I shine in the morning, full of pockets, few friends
Gold on the finger and it's like that I don't solve, I don't hear
Baby listens to the language, listens to how I was brought up to a different habit
Just my own and that's it, I don't see any others

Come on dance, say when to add, when enough is enough
I can smell you, shawty, I can feel you move, shawty
I can see how you shine, that you feel what we have now
I know that in the morning, I know that in the morning we will be alone and what will happen next?
I know I'm driving around the country and I don't have time
That you'll wait for me, that I'm worth your wrinkles
It's all new to me, I lived alone until now
I'm going to buy you Chanel, have a good time
I see you like Italy as much as I do
We will reconcile as well as argue
Baby, as long as you're here, I know where the truth is
I miss someone by my side who will shine here
I speak only from the heart and no goodbyes
It's my first time seeing you, but I'm already thinking about the next time
You know it's booze talking now, but I can't think of anyone else
But I was probably in the right place at the right time

Come on dance, say when to add, when enough is enough

A teď už cítím jak sprintuje čas
Ještě než usnu, chci slyšet tvůj hlas
Ať zůstane věčných i těch pár chvil
Kdy zpívalas ze všech svých sil
Že kořínek tvůj je tuhý jak kmen
Stromy však dorostou, nezapomeň
Ale v korunách vedou tisíce tras
Na konci každé sejdem se zas

And that you can't catch all the places
But he's a good guy, an altruist
After all, he gave me you, home, port
And in it is you, my whole world
Kind arms and frantic flight
And music around us, one of those beauties
When we get chills
You know, hearts don't go out
But it can happen
How many times
I'm starting to get scared
Then you must not give up
To all of your travels
My only one of the stars
I'll keep shining for you
What if I get swept away by the current?
Then you have to sail
Have a raft of laurels
And don't fall asleep on it
To all of your travels
My only one of the stars
I'll keep shining for you
And now I can already feel how time is sprinting
Before I fall asleep, I want to hear your voice
Let even those few moments remain eternal
When did you sing at the top of your lungs?
That your root is as stiff as a trunk
Trees will grow back though, don't forget
But there are thousands of routes in crowns
I'll meet again at the end of each one

Konopný lana, tak ty už něco vydrží
Zkaženej dech a čtyry deci pod kůží
Nebe rudý, břízy brzo pokvetou
A chlapi z nudy baví se ruskou ruletou
Když svoje lodě proti proudu táhnou
Navzdory všem kamenům
Proč jenom touhy po čase vadnou
Otroci řeky, prach a špína, tvrdá zem
Jediná výhra, je tanec smrti s medvědem
A tak si žijou, ze dne na den tisíc let
Burlaci pijou, jak bylo by to naposled
Když svoje lodě proti proudu táhnou
Navzdory všem kamenům
Proč jenom touhy po čase vadnou?
Otoč se a podívej
Nebe je temný a mnohem níž
Jen vlků dávnej chorál z hor
A já tu marně hledám skrýš
Když cesta rovná se nám ztrácí
Lidi jsou andělé a nebo draci
A každej dobrej skutek sílu vrací
No tak jen otoč se a podívej na lodě za tebou!

Není to lehký, ve světě lží a polopravd
Na břehu řeky harmonika začla hrát
Tamtoho léta vítr stopy zahladil
Jsme jako oni, už nezbejvá nám tolik sil
Když svoje lodě proti proudu táhnem
Navzdory všem kamenům
Jednou si každej až na dno sáhnem

Otoč se a podívej
Nebe je temný a mnohem níž
Jen vlků dávnej chorál z hor
A já tu marně hledám skrýš

Hemp rope, you'll last a while
Bad breath and four children under the skin
The sky is red, the birch trees will soon bloom
And guys play Russian roulette out of boredom
When they pull their ships upstream
Despite all the stones
Why only desires fade after time
Slaves of the river, dust and dirt, hard earth
The only win is the dance of death with the bear
And so they live, day by day for a thousand years
Burlacs drink as if it were the last time
When they pull their ships upstream
Despite all the stones
Why do only desires fade after time?
Turn and look
The sky is dark and much lower
Only wolves' ancient chant from the mountains
And I'm looking for a hiding place in vain
When the road is straight, we lose it
People are angels or dragons
And every good deed gives strength back
Well, just turn around and look at the ships behind you!

It's not easy, in a world of lies and half-truths
On the bank of the river, an accordion began to play
That summer, the wind obliterated the tracks
We are like them, we don't lack so much strength anymore
When I pull my ships upstream
Despite all the stones
One day I'll get to the bottom of everyone

Turn and look
The sky is dark and much lower
Only wolves' ancient chant from the mountains
And I'm looking for a hiding place in vain
When the road is straight, we lose it
People are angels or dragons
And every good deed gives strength back
Well, just turn around and look at the ships behind you!

Jsi furt ještě tady, když se chovám jako dick
Proč se furt chceš bavit, když jsem jako Pickle Rick
Vím, že ti neberu phone, i když jsem furt home

Teď zas flexíš, pak zapomínáš, že to nemusí být na stálo

It seems to me that I can see better thanks to the pause
When the world is in p..., you will understand who your people are
When the world is in pi..., you will understand better who you are
I was Quentin T. when it came to your feelings
You're still here when I'm acting like a dick
Why do you still want to have fun when I'm like Pickle Rick
I know I don't answer your phone, even when I'm still at home
But I had a mess in my head and the cleaning took a long time
I've been thinking a lot about what I want in the house
After dark I dealt with hoes that weren't for me
Only when they turned off the power, they ran out of cash and canceled the shows
Only when the numbers lose their meaning do you begin to perceive what's going on
When we don't know what's next, yeah
It's starting to get a little clearer
That the things we were afraid of don't seem so bad anymore
I feel like we should have been more crazy
Crazy moments were felt
When we don't know what's next (yeah)
We're getting a little more, more crazy

We steam more. The neighbors are envious that we know how to live
If they screw us up, we have to tell them, because if I keep my mouth shut, we don't have to be here
Fuck what you have, when it was a bad time, the taks used to scold you nonstop about how little you have
Now you flex again, then you forget that it doesn't have to be permanent
You forget that you were happier when they invited you to the toilet
Before there was designer, luxury, drip and 150 shoes
I flew where I wanted to fly

Jako malej místo seriálu jsem čuměl do prázdný, otevřený lednice
Trochu jsme vyrostli, čumim, jak vyhazujeme otevřený krabice
Krabice od věcí, co balej nasraný lidi ve tři ráno na lince
Taky jsme nasraný balili po šichtě v smradlavý ulici palice

Tohle neni pro mě ten kruh, koukat jak mi hladoví crew
My si jdeme pro tu krev, teď zaraž mi do srdce kůl (Ah)
Zabij mě nebo mi řekni, kde máme ten loot (Kde je ten loot?)
Já vracim se v čase, mý hodiny jedou dokola jak loop
Teď vemu si půl, budu tam v půl (Vemu si půl, budu tam v půl)
A za půl hodiny jsеm letěl na malej vůz (Na malej vůz)
Nostalgiе do mě bodá svůj nůž
Já vracim se zpět, hraje mi rap, hraje mi blues
Řekni mi, dělá na tebe dojem můj vůz nebo to, co jde z mejch úst?
Teď co z toho si vezmu s sebou tam?
V hlavě čekám na autobus i když už jsem ušel kus
I když už se vozim jenom jako pán
Hraje hudba, zažívám trans
Veme mě na místa, co znám
Stále těžší dostat se tam
Něco končí, začíná teď

Já v tichu slyšim něco hrát (Co?) –⁠⁠ nostalgie umírá
Mami, koukej, jak se časem vezu já
Jedem dolů, co se asi může stát?

A nostalgie umírá
Mami, koukej, jak se časem vezu já
Jedem dolů, co se asi může stát?
A slyšim noty, slyšim svý hodiny hrát

Všechny ty klišé kecy jsou pravda
Ale nesmíš je říkat nahlas, pak stává se z nich sranda
Spíš cringe, přemejšlet nad minulostí můj standard
Přijde ti, že bylo líp i když skoro nebylo co jíst
Máme krásnej další den –⁠ bouchla varna
Já stojim ve vchodě jak dilino, protože na ruce zůstala barva mi
A bába mi říká, že věděla to, že jsem vandal, asi píčo hanba mi
A když jdeme ven, je to jako by po roce do města dorazil jarmark
Pardon, omluv můj žargon
Chtěl jsem jen BMW M3 v Need For Speed Carbon
V něm mám Harman Kardon, žádný Lambo
Furt jsem ten zmrd, co sedí na kávě jak Karlo
Slyšim něco hrát –⁠ nostalgie umírá, pojď si se mnou něco dát
Spíš si z hlavy odpoj drát, co se asi může stát pak?

As a child, instead of the series, I stared at the empty, open refrigerator
We've grown up a bit, I see us throw away the opened box
Boxes of stuff, what do you pack pissed off people on the line at three in the morning
We also packed sticks in a stinky street one shift at a time

This is not the circle for me, watching my crew starve
We're out for the blood, now put a stake in my heart (Ah)
Kill me or tell me where we got the loot (Where's the loot?)
I go back in time, my clock goes round and round like a loop
I'll take half now, I'll be there at half (I'll take half, I'll be there at half)
And in half an hour I flew on a small car (On a small car)
Nostalgia stabs its knife into me
I'm going back, I'm playing rap, I'm playing blues
Tell me, are you impressed by my car or what comes out of my mouth?
Now what do I take with me there?
I'm waiting for the bus in my head, even though I've already walked a long way
Even if I only drive like a gentleman
Music is playing, I'm in a trance
We take me to places I know
Harder and harder to get there
Something ends, begins now

I hear something playing in the silence (What?) –⁠⁠ nostalgia dies
Mom, look at how I'm moving over time
I'm going down, what could possibly happen?
I hear the notes, I hear my clock playing

All that cliche bullshit is true
But you mustn't say them out loud, then they become funny
More of a cringe, to reflect on the past my standard
You think it was better even though there was almost nothing to eat
We have another beautiful day - the boiler boomed
I'm standing in the entrance like a dilino, because the paint remained on my hand
And grandma tells me that she knew I was a vandal, shame on me
And when we go out, it's like a fair has arrived in town after a year
Sorry, excuse my jargon
I just wanted a BMW M3 in Need For Speed ​​Carbon
I have a Harman Kardon in it, no Lambo
I'm still the shit that sits on the coffee like Karlo
I hear something playing –⁠ nostalgia is dying, come have something with me
Rather disconnect the wire from your head, what can happen then?

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later, we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling

Voices singing, ""Let's be jolly (Ooo)
Deck the halls with boughs of holly!""

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily
In the new old-fashioned way

Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart, right in front of you

Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take

Yeah
I know sometimes
Things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey
What Daddy always tell you?
Straighten up, little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you cryin' about?
You got me
Hailie, I know you miss your Mom, and I know you miss your Dad
When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there, Daddy's wit' you in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears, Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Lainie, Uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
We're all we got in this world when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, Mama's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just somethin' we have no control over, and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream

Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright

Heh, it's funny
I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night crying
'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your Mom was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your Mama's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot
So Mama moved back on to Chalmers in the flat, one-bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre, and flew you and Mama out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Mama had to leave me
Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV
And Mama didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Mama developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house just reminiscin'
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Shh! Mama's only gone for the moment
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright

And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad! (Haha)400Embed","TranslationsTürkçePortuguêsItalianoDeutschFrançaisالعربيةMockingbird Lyrics

Okaaay

Všechno jde podle plánu, i když to něco stálo
Jak jsem řek už dávno, zapomeň, že nastavim dlaň
Všechno jde podle plánu, i když to něco stálo
Jak jsem řek už dávno, klidně za to zaplatim daň
Vždycky na prvnim místě skóre, je to od dětství ve mně
Ptali se proč tak dlouho solo, asi mám štěstí ve hře
Nebo bych měl už pustit plyn, zkurveně dlouho v driftu
Ale kdykoliv povolim, naleju drink, rovnováha do ksichtu
Buď bude šťastnej vztah nebo bude další vila
Buď bude šťastnej vztah nebo vim, že to celý byla jenom moje vlastní vina
Hustlim jinak, do plnejch 365, vole sám jak voják
Brzo bude na prdeli tak akorát
Nebo taky ne a budu sám napořád

Všechno jde podle plánu, i když to něco stálo
Jak jsеm řek už dávno, zapomeň, že nastavim dlaň
Všеchno jde podle plánu, i když to něco stálo
Jak jsem řek už dávno, klidně za to zaplatim daň

Platim daň, platim daň, platim daň, platim daň
Platim daň, klidně za to zaplatim daň
Platim daň, platim daň, platim daň
Jak jsem řek už dávno, klidně za to zaplatim daň

Ať si o tom myslej, co chtěj, láska je čistej luxus
Na kterej teď není čas, počkej, vyřešim byznys a hudbu
Psát až od východu slunce, sbírat ty ksichty, ty sumce
Vstávat, zprávy, zmeškaný cally, ale nikdy zpět do tý zpíčený džungle
Nemůžu si dovolit povolit, hořim jak molotov
Plameny monolit, navěky skoro top
Furt jen skoro, ta štafeta sežere hromady svobody
Skoro mi přijde, že víc to bere
Ale to hladový zvíře v genech
Klid jenom ve snech, dej sem hned cash

Okay

Everything is going according to plan, even if it cost something
As I said a long time ago, forget about setting the palm
Everything is going according to plan, even if it cost something
As I said a long time ago, I'll pay the tax for it
Always on top of the score, it's been in me since childhood
They asked why solo for so long, I guess I'm lucky in the game
Or should I let off the gas already, drifting for a fucking long time
But whenever I give in, I pour a drink, balance in my face
Either there will be a happy relationship or there will be another villa
Either there will be a happy relationship or I will see that it was all my own fault
I pump differently, to the full 365, dude alone like a soldier
Soon he will be fucked just right
Or not and I'll be alone forever

Everything is going according to plan, even if it cost something
As I said a long time ago, forget about setting the palm
Everything is going according to plan, even if it cost something
As I said a long time ago, I'll pay the tax for it

I pay tax, I pay tax, I pay tax, I pay tax
I pay tax, I'll pay tax for it
I pay tax, I pay tax, I pay tax
As I said a long time ago, I'll pay the tax for it

Whatever you think about it, love is pure luxury
For which there is no time now, wait, I will take care of business and music
Writing since sunrise, collecting those faces, those catfish
Get up, message, missed cally, but never back to that smothered jungle
I can't afford to give in, I'm burning like a molotov
Flames monolith, forever almost top
And almost, that relay will eat up heaps of freedom
It almost seems to me that it takes more
But that hungry beast in the genes
Peace only in dreams, give me cash now

You want me to tell you something?
Uh-huh

'Cause I know you want me, baby, I think I want you too
I think I love you, baby, I think I love you too (Oh-ooh)
I'm here to save you, girl, come be in Shady's world (Ooh-ooh, ooh)

You know you want me, baby, you know I want you too
They call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you, girl, come be in Shady's world (Ooh-ooh)
Oh boy, you drive me crazy, bitch, you make me hurl
They call me Superman
Leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now: got no ring on this finger now
I'd never let another chick bring me down
In a relationship; save it, bitch!
Babysit? You make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit
Girl, you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I tell a muhfuckin' slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's-her-face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass
Kiss my lips? Bitch, why ask?
Kiss my dick, get my cash?
I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out? I'll put you out
Won't get out? I'll push you out
Puss blew out, poppin' shit
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Am I too nice? Buy you ice?
Bitch, if you died, wouldn't buy you life

Trouble
Blood is in the rocky waters
Hide away your sons and daughters
Eat you alive

Better put your head on swivels
Dancin' with the very devil
Butter to knife
You think you're better than them
Better than them
You think they're really your friends
Really your friends
But when it comes to the end
To the end
You're just the same as them
Same as them (Ha ha ha ha ha)

Tak nabij mi ten smoke, smoke it a jsem gone
Mladý zmrdi žádnou pomoc nepotřebujou
Sem love rotujou, mladší motivujou
Dělat jenom na sebe, ne na stranu druhou

Novej den, nový triko, novej swag, sypu track za trackem
Návyk, crack, dám jim shit, příjmu back
Dej mi stack, plním bag, plním sál, plním sen
Plním plány, posouvám to jakože kde kurva jsem? (nevim)
Kam že zítra jdem? Nemám plány na potom
Vím, že zapálím ten beat, hoří jako molotov
Prostřen plnej stůl, jdem jíst, je tu všechno zadarmo
Krysy zamnou v pozadí, chtěj mě zpátky na to dno
Měl jsem dlouhej den, čeká mě dlouhá noc
Stárneme jak zmrd, nemám z života povinnost
Nemám pilota na život, cеlý to řídím jak kár
Dobrý chvíle, špatný chvíle, vím, že nеmůžu rozsekat
Zmrde, výška, všude kudy jezdíme tak výška
Riskujeme všechno, navždy fuckujeme fízla
Fuck-off na ty čísla, fuck-off i na diesla
Budu točit shit až do mý poslední chvíle
Aah, až do mý poslední chvíle, hoe
Ha, až do mý poslední chvíle, hoe
Wow, až do mý poslední chvíle, hoe, wow
Tak nabij mi ten smoke, smoke it a jsem gone
Mladý zmrdi žádnou pomoc nepotřebujou
Sem love rotujou, mladší motivujou
Dělat jenom na sebe, ne na stranu druhou

Dělat jenom na sebe - Nostalgie
Přehrávám jak tenkrát DVD, v mým pokoji
Moje hudba jako anime, krev na podlaze
Zbloudělý duše popisujou svoje emoce
Prcám žít seklý v předloze, jdu žít, pičo, divoce
Sick z toho trochu jsem, furt plyn na mý podlaze
Ujiždím dál, démoni v zrcadle v odraze
Jsou se mnou 24/7 na mým rameni

Navždy mladej zmrd, pičo, v mojim srdci trap
Vždycky talent na to jak z jednoho udělat dvě
Zmrdi z Chebu znají struggle, heavy situace
Do tý doby co jsem tady, tak se pro mý budu otáčet

Tak nabij mi ten smoke, smoke it a jsem gone

Love rotates here, motivates the younger ones
Do it only for yourself, not for the other party

Habit, crack, I give them shit, I get back
Give me a stack, I'm filling a bag, I'm filling a hall, I'm filling a dream
I'm making plans, pushing it like where the fuck am I? (I don't see)
Where am I going tomorrow? I have no plans after that
I know I'm gonna set that beat on fire, it burns like a molotov
Set a full table, I'm going to eat, everything is free here
Rats squeal in the background, take me back to the bottom
I've had a long day, I'm in for a long night
We're getting old like shit, I don't have a duty in life
I don't have a pilot for life, I drive the whole thing like a cart
Good moment, bad moment, I know I can't cut
Shit, height, height everywhere we go
We're risking everything, we're forever fucking fuckers
Fuck-off on those numbers, fuck-off on diesels too
I will shoot shit until my last moment
Aah, until my last moment, hoe
Ha, until my last moment, hoe
Wow, until my last moment, hoe, wow

Love rotates here, motivates the younger ones
Do it only for yourself, not for the other party

Doing only for yourself - Nostalgia
I'm playing DVDs like back then, in my room
My music like anime, blood on the floor
Lost souls describe their emotions
I'm going to live my life in a pattern, I'm going to live, bitch, wildly
I'm a bit sick of it, still gas on my floor
I drive on, demons in the mirror in the reflection
They are with me 24/7 on my shoulder

Forever young shit, bitch, trouble in my heart
Always a talent for making two out of one
Zrmdi ​​from Cheb know struggle, heavy situations
As long as I'm here, I'll be spinning for mine

And if you get burned, don't be surprised

Got me lifted, drifted higher than the ceilin'

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, baby
Ooh, ooh, hey

Ah, she got cherry lips, angel eyes
She knows exactly how to tantalize
She's out to get you, danger by design
Cold-blooded vixen, she don't compromise
She's somethin' mystical in colored lights
So far from typical, but take my advice
Before you play with fire, do think twice
And if you get burned, don't be surprised

Got me lifted, drifted higher than the ceilin'
Ooh, baby, it's the ultimate feelin'
You got me lifted, feelin' so gifted
Sugar, how you get so fly?

Sugar, how you get so fly?
Oh, sugar, how you get so fly?
Oh, sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
Oh, sugar, how you get so fly?

Oh, Sweet-talkin' lady, love how you entice
Sugar with just the right amount of spice
Charmin', allurin', everyone's desire
She's out to get you – you can't run, you can't hide

She's somethin' mystical in colored lights
I say, so far from typical, but take my advice
Before you play with fire, do think twice
And if you get burned, well, baby, don't you be surprised

Yeah, poslouchej
Nikdo mi nevěřil, more já nevěřim nikomu doteď
Míchámе Xan & Coke, mícháme Beluga, Moët
Morе jsem vyvolenej jako Noe, vyvolenej jako Neo
Čůza vypadá jak Trinity, amore mio (Love)
Posílám big up sám pro sebe, big up pro všechny mý lidi (Milion+)
Žádní noví kamarádi kolem mě goblini, čerti, démoni
Kolem mě čarodějnice, kolem mě bros jak Coen
Kolem mě lidi co vědí a fízly nevolaj
Kolem mě lidi co nemluví - konaj
Můj krk led a z huby jde oheň
Německej whip a kola se točej (Skrrt)
Tráva je purple, barva jak kodein
Vydělej cash, se nezaprodej (Nikdy)
Říkám jí kotě pojď prdelí dolů, dolů a ona že okay
Udělej bounce, potom mi dolej
Každej můj zmrd baller, spolu jsme nahoře, spolu jsme byli i dole (Ballin')
Haarp na beatu to kope
Pokud jde o beef, tak žeru jen Kobe (Hovězí)
A teprv teď já budu fakt baller (Ballin')
A kdyby se hra jmenovala Lucie, tak Yzo se jmenuje Koller (Ayy)

A nejhorší na tom je, že o tom víš ale ti to nevadí a chtěl si to tak (Koště)

No one believed me, I don't believe anyone until now
We mix Xan & Coke, we mix Beluga, Moët
I am chosen like Noah, chosen like Neo
The shoe looks like Trinity, amore mio (Love)
Sending big up for myself, big up for all my people (Million+)
No new friends around me goblins, devils, demons
Witches around me, bros like Coen around me
Don't call people who know and fool around me
People around me who don't talk - act
My neck is ice and my mouth is fire
German whip and the wheels spin (Skrrt)
Weed is purple, color like codeine
Make Cash Don't Sell Out (Never)
I tell her, babe, get your ass down, down, and she says okay
Do the bounce, then fill me up
Every one of my f*ck baller, we're up together, we've been down together (Ballin')
Haarp on the beat kicks it

Život jako horská dráha
Není to pár let zpátky, už je to dekáda, co jsem
Byl na startovní čáře, ale tam se nezůstává
Nekončim a neprohrávám, teda zatim žádná zkáza
Klepu na dřevo, rozhlížim se kolem sebe
Pozor si dávám, pozor dávám i na tebe
Kolem mě je panorama, v noci kolem Futurama
V noci čáry máry, pak žádná morálka
V dáli slyšim bass, taky kytary
Asi už hraje můj track, asi už mě vyvolávaj
Brzo vypadnu, pryč se vypálim, někde v oceánu
Budeme žrát Campari, kalamáry, utratíme všechny money
Co jsme vydělali, dneska přijel Calin, tak tě tu vítáme
Sešli jsme se – rare sestava, uh

Triple double my circle, my people, Popstar
I got everything when I want it, when I see it, yeah
He's filming everything he sees around him, yeah
Alice in Wonderland, she doesn't understand what we live
And I sit in the car from can't see to can't see, no
And I close my eyes, another country, another feeling, yeah
We can smell one like you for miles
When he stands up for himself, others will deal with them
I know what you are, I glance at you, I see them
I know exactly what you want, go look elsewhere, yeah

Life is like a roller coaster
It's not a few years ago, it's been a decade now
He was on the starting line, but he doesn't stay there
I don't quit and I don't lose, so then no doom
I knock on wood, I look around
I take care of myself, I take care of you too
Around me is the skyline, at night around Futurama
At night the lines of the dead, then no morality
In the distance I hear bass, guitars too
He's probably already playing my track, he's probably calling me
Soon I'll fall out, burn myself away, somewhere in the ocean
We will eat Campari, calamari, spend all the money
What we earned, Calin arrived today, so we welcome you here
We met - rare line-up, uh

One day replaces another, a year older even if only a month has passed
The night still belongs to me, and there are already a thousand of those nights
I don't need coke, up until the morning, no, I don't sleep
When he texts me what I'm doing, I'm not in the mood to write
I'm not in the mood to talk, just to pass the time
Get tired and sleep, come, work and leave
No date, no lunch, no, I don't feel anything for you
Although I have so many muses, enough of everything and my crew
I know exactly what I want and what I don't want
We are growing up - what was yesterday is no longer today
And we don't know what will happen tomorrow, the forecast keeps changing
And to decide for too long, there is no time for that
And I miss meeting new people
And hesitating, deciding for too long could kill me

I met you in the dark, you lit me up
You made me feel as though I was enough
We danced the night away, we drank too much
I held your hair back when you were throwin' up

Then, you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, ""I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest""
I knew I loved you then, but you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you, but I never showed
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school, wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, woah
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that every day, you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you and I hope you know
Darlin', your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far, my dear, look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old
You might also like
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me when I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till my lungs give out
I promise till death we part, like in our vows
So, I wrote this song for you, now everybody knows
That it's just you and me till we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go
Oh, just say you won't let go153Embed","TranslationsΕλληνικάTürkçePortuguêsDeutschBahasa IndonesiaSay You Won’t Let Go Lyrics
